{"id": "DL_01", "prompt": "# Solid-State Drive Design Task - Single Configuration Parameter\n\nIn this problem, you will finalize a set of Solid-State Drive (SSD) designs that meet the performance requirements for a specific workload type. Initially, you must determine which parameters to tune—and to what extent—to satisfy the given performance criteria.\n\n## Background\n\n![fig_ssd_arch](./images/ssdhardware.png)\n\nThe internal architecture of a typical SSD is presented in the above Figure. An SSD consists of five major components: a set of flash memory packages, an SSD controller having embedded processors like ARM, off-chip DRAM (SSD DRAM), flash controllers, and the I/O interface that includes SATA and NVMe protocols. The flash packages are organized in a hierarchical manner. Each SSD has multiple channels, and each channel can process read/write commands independently. Each channel is shared by multiple flash packages. Each package has multiple flash chips. Within each chip, there are multiple planes. Each plane includes multiple flash blocks, and each block has multiple flash pages. The page size varies in different SSDs. When a free flash page is written once, that page is no longer available for future writes until that page is erased. However, erase operation is expensive and performed at block granularity. As each flash block has limited endurance, it is important for blocks to age uniformly (i.e., wear leveling). Modern SSD controllers employ out-of-place write, GC, and wear leveling to overcome these shortcomings and maintain indirections for the address translation in their flash translation layer (FTL).\n\nIn this problem, our aim is to design SSDs that allow developers to customize SSD hardware according to the application needs.\n\n## Task Description\n\nSSD customers typically evaluate SSD performance using key metrics including I/O throughput, average latency and tail latency. In this section, you should optimize the given SSD configuration by tuning the top-5 most significant parameter to reach the given performance requirement. You should first select the top-5 critical parameters, and answer what is the final value of each parameter if you tune it ALONE to reach the performance requirements. If the requirement cannot be reached, please answer \"impossible\" instead of the final parameter value. Please always provide your reasoning.\n\n### Formal Problem Definition\n\nGiven a parameter set $S$ and a workload set $W$, select 5 top parameter $s \\in S$ that affects the I/O throughput, average latency or both of them for each workload $w \\in W$. Specifically, address the following question for this 5 parameters:\n\nIf we want to get 20\\% performance improvement on I/O throughput or on average latency comparing to the baseline configuration (see next section), how should we tune this single parameter? If this is impossible, please answer \"impossible\" instead of providing the number and explain why. Note that the correlation between performance and parameter values are usurally not linear.\n\n### Configuration Set\n\nPlease provide answer for each parameter listed in the table below. The third column of this table listed the baseline configuration (Samsung 983 DCT 1.92TB SSD). We provide typical values for each parameter, you can also choose value outside the listed parameters (we assume that these design can be achieved with advanced manufacture techniques, to create next-generation SSDs), but the parameter should follow the general trend in the listed parameters (e.g., number of channels should be descrete numbers). \n\n| Parameter Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Baseline   |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|\n| PCIe_Lane_Bandwidth       | The PCIe bandwidth per lane in GB/s.

{"id": "DL_02", "prompt": "# Solid-State Drive Design Task - Parmeter Set with Constraints\n\nIn this problem, you will finalize a set of Solid-State Drive (SSD) designs that meet the performance requirements for a specific workload type. In this problem, you need to identify an optimized parameter set that satisfy the given performance criteria under given constraints (e.g., the capacity constriants need the multiple of several parameters to stay in a given range).\n\n## Background\n\n![fig_ssd_arch](./images/ssdhardware.png)\n\nThe internal architecture of a typical SSD is presented in the above Figure. An SSD consists of five major components: a set of flash memory packages, an SSD controller having embedded processors like ARM, off-chip DRAM (SSD DRAM), flash controllers, and the I/O interface that includes SATA and NVMe protocols. The flash packages are organized in a hierarchical manner. Each SSD has multiple channels, and each channel can process read/write commands independently. Each channel is shared by multiple flash packages. Each package has multiple flash chips. Within each chip, there are multiple planes. Each plane includes multiple flash blocks, and each block has multiple flash pages. The page size varies in different SSDs. When a free flash page is written once, that page is no longer available for future writes until that page is erased. However, erase operation is expensive and performed at block granularity. As each flash block has limited endurance, it is important for blocks to age uniformly (i.e., wear leveling). Modern SSD controllers employ out-of-place write, GC, and wear leveling to overcome these shortcomings and maintain indirections for the address translation in their flash translation layer (FTL).\n\nIn this problem, our aim is to design SSDs that allow developers to customize SSD hardware according to the application needs.\n\n## Task Description\n\nSSD customers typically evaluate SSD performance using key metrics including I/O throughput, average latency and tail latency. In this section, you should optimize the given SSD configuration by tuning only the layout related parameters (\"Overprovisioning_Ratio\", \"Flash_Channel_Count\", \"Chip_No_Per_Channel\", \"Die_No_Per_Chip\", \"Plane_No_Per_Die\",\n \"Block_No_Per_Plane\", \"Page_No_Per_Block\"). You should identify a set of these parameter that satisfy the capacity constraint (The total usable capacity, not considering the over provisioning, should be around 2TB, specifically, 1.7TB - 2.1TB) and reach the performance requirements. If the requirement cannot be reached, please answer \"impossible\" instead of the final parameter value. Please always provide your reasoning.\n\n### Formal Problem Definition\n\nGiven a parameter set $S$ and a workload set $W$, tune the parameters (\"Overprovisioning_Ratio\", \"Flash_Channel_Count\", \"Chip_No_Per_Channel\", \"Die_No_Per_Chip\", \"Plane_No_Per_Die\",\n \"Block_No_Per_Plane\", \"Page_No_Per_Block\") $s \\in S$ that affects the I/O throughput, average latency or both of them for each workload $w \\in W$. Specifically, address the following question:\n\nIf we want to get 20\\% performance improvement on I/O throughput or on average latency comparing to the baseline configuration (see next section), while also satisfy the capacity constraint (The total capacity, not considering the over provisioning, should be around 2TB, specifically, 1.7TB - 2.1TB) how should we tune these parameters? If this is impossible, please answer \"impossible\" instead of providing the number and explain why. Note that the correlation between performance and parameter values are usurally not linear.\n\n### Configuration Set\n\nPlease provide answer for each parameter listed in the table below. The third column of this table listed the baseline configuration (Samsung 983 DCT 1.92TB SSD). We provide typical values for each parameter, the tuned parameter should follow the general trend in the listed parameters (e.g., number of channels should be descrete numbers). \n\nFor convenience of reasoning, we provide all the parameters for the baseline. Please only tune the speciftied parameters (\"Overprovisioning_Ratio\", \"Flash_Channel_Count\", \"Chip_No_Per_Channel\", \"Die_No_Per_Chip\", \"Plane_No_Per_Die\",\n \"Block_No_Per_Plane\", \"Page_No_Per_Block\") and the tuning range is specified in the listed parameters.\n\n| Parameter Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Baseline   |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|\n| PCIe_Lane_Bandwidth       | The PCIe bandwidth per lane in GB/s.

{"id": "KV_03", "prompt": "Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System – Design Challenge Task\n\nTask Title:\nFill-in-the-Blank System Architecture Inference – Battery CC-CV Interface\n\nSystem Description:\nThe system balances a 3-cell lithium-ion battery pack using switched-capacitor charge redistribution. The system includes six switches (S1–S6), two capacitors, and a Battery CC-CV block that can both inject and extract current depending on the system’s state-of-charge (SOC). The current flow is dynamically controlled based on SOC feedback, voltage readings, and a relay mechanism to toggle modes. A PI controller regulates behavior during charging and discharging. The goal is to maintain safe and efficient balancing under varying SOC conditions using only local cell information and logic-driven control blocks.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n- Battery: 3 Li-ion cells in series, each 27 Ah\n- Capacitors: 0.5 F each (2 total)\n- Switches: 6 total; closed resistance = 0.00734 Ω, open conductance = 1e-5 S\n- Switching control: 50% duty cycle, Tper = 0.006 s\n- Initial SOCs: Cell 1 = 0.8, Cell 2 = 0.75, Cell 3 = 0.7\n- Battery CC-CV behavior with max voltage = 4.1 V\n- PI Controller: Proportional gain = 100, Integral gain = 10\n- Feedback channels include SOC and voltage monitoring through ZOH blocks\n- Relay logic is used to switch between injecting and withdrawing current\n- Final current output is passed through a control logic layer before being applied to the Battery CC-CV block\n\nDesign Task:\nYou are given a redacted system diagram with 9 missing functional blocks labeled A through J (excluding H, which is not used). Each label corresponds to a required Simulink or logic block that enables correct operation of the system. Your task is to infer and name the correct block for each label based only on your understanding of the system architecture and its operational requirements.\n\nTo assist, here are examples of Simulink or logical block types that may appear somewhere in the system (not in any particular order, and not mapped to any specific label):\n\n- max\n- chargingenabled\n- cellvoltage\n- currentwhencharging\n- currentwhendischarging\n- gain\n- constant\n- relay\n- current output port\n\nYou must **not assume the ordering** or directly match these terms to any label. Instead, you must analyze the described system behavior and infer the correct Simulink block for each missing label. Do not include any explanations, justifications, or descriptions — only provide the mapping.\n\nExpected Output Format:\nReturn a dictionary in the following format, using strings that correspond to valid Simulink block types or logic expressions (no comments, no extra spaces, no Markdown, no special control characters):\n\n{\n  \"A\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"B\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"C\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"D\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"E\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"F\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"G\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"I\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\",\n  \"J\": \"<Simulink block or logic>\"\n}", "domain_topic": null, "task_provider": "Kojo Vandyck", "evaluation_pipeline": null, "output_structure": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/KV_03/output_structure.py", "class": "Response_structure"}, "evaluator": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/KV_03/evaluate.py", "function": "evaluate_llm_response"}}

Your module will produce an n-bit Gray code on each rising edge of a clock, starting from zero after a synchronous, active‐low reset\n\n### Background\nGray code (also known as reflected binary code) is an ordering of binary numbers such that two successive values differ in only a single bit. This property is critical in digital interfaces (e.g., rotary encoders, ADCs) to minimize glitching when multiple bits change simultaneously. The standard encoding for an n-bit Gray code can be built by reflecting and prefixing the (n-1)-bit sequence.\n\n### Module Interface\nYour Verilog source file `code.sv` must declare a module with the following signature, the module SHOULD be named model:\n\nmodule model #(parameter\n  DATA_WIDTH = 4\n) (\n  input clk,\n  input resetn,\n  output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] out\n);\n\n\nN: positive integer ≥ 1, set via parameter.\n\nclk: single‐bit input, rising‐edge clock.\n\nresetn: synchronous, active‐low reset.

{"id": "WJ_01", "prompt": "Task Description\n\nConsider an image denoising task where a grayscale image is corrupted by additive noise. \nThe image is represented as a NumPy array in Python. The goal is to design a filter pipeline using a Large Language Model (LLM) \nthat reads the noisy image and returns a denoised version 'filtered_img'\nThe input image 'img' is available as a NumPy array and you will get the image encoded using base64 method. \nYou need to analyze the type of noise added into the image carefully. If only one type of noise is added maybe one or two carefully selected filters which are specially designed for the noise is enough. \nIf the image is corrupted by a mixture of different noise task will be complicated. One to two filters may not be enough so \nyou may need to use a series of filters. No prior knowledge is given on the exact noise parameters.\nExplore and combine **a diverse set of filters** available in OpenCV when the task is complicated. Do not just simply rely on gaussian and median filters when you think they are not sufficient, try more filters. \nFeel free to use simple function deisgn when you think that the noise is simple and one or two single filters such as gaussian filter or median filter are enough to finish the task. In this case, do not make the design complicated, \nif a single filter may work, just use a single filter. \nMake sure the generated code is executable so you must carefully review your code after you finish the function. \nInput image is a color image so the output image should also be a color image with shape (3, 512, 512). \n\nTask\n\nDesign a sequence of filters to denoise the input image. The LLM should:\n1. Read and analyze the data in the image. If there's only a single type of noise, tell me the name and if there's a mixture of different noise list the types of noise. \n\n2. Review common types of noise, their characteristic and their filter strateg. Explain the filtering strategy: list each filter to be applied in order, along with the motivation for its use (e.g., remove salt-and-pepper noise, preserve edges while reducing Gaussian noise).\n\n3. Specify filter parameters: for each filter, clearly define its parameters (e.g., kernel size, sigma, threshold).\n\n4. Generate executable code: write a Python function named denoise_image that takes 'img' as input, applies the filter pipeline step by step using standard Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, OpenCV, SciPy), and outputs the denoised image in the variable 'filtered_img'.\n\nThe function must be a single Python code block, like this: \n    def denoise_image(noisy_img):\n        # your code \n    \n        return filtered_img\n\nWhen I evaluate the results, I focuses on how much information you can recover from the noisy image \nand I will use MSE and PSNR as matrics.

Determine the **minimum** number of counter bits `n` such that `2^n >= division_ratio`.\n4. Select two appropriate counter bits to use for digit selection (ensure they cycle through 4 values).\n5. Justify your digit bit selection.\n6. Calculate the maximum possible delay between refreshes of the same digit under worst-case conditions. You should consider the clock tolerance of ±100 ppm (parts per million, or 0.0001), the potential delay of up to 5 clock cycles in the display driver logicand the current refresh period based on calculations from tasks 1-2\n7.

You are provided with two global inputs: engine speed (N) and fuel mass (F), and four local inputs: injection (S), fuel pressure (P), variable geometry turbo rack position (G) and exhaust gas recirculation valve lift (E). Given the defined input ranges and physical constraints, you are required to perform structured sampling of the input space using the specified sampling strategy, ensuring representative and constraint-compliant coverage for subsequent modeling and calibration tasks.\n\n### Task 1\nFirst, for the global inputs: engine speed (N) and fuel mass (F), the maximum value of F changes as the value of N changes.

When N is in the interval [1600, 2000], the sampling points you find need to satisfy this linear relationship. When N is not in the interval [1600, 2000], there are no constraints on F.\n- Requirements:\n - Use the LHS strategy to generate 15 design points.\n - All sampled points must satisfy the constraint on F based on N.\n\n### Task 3\nGiven a global operating point with engine speed N = 1900 rpm, calculate the **normalized speed factor** as: f = (N - 1600) / (2200 - 1600).\nUse this factor f to determine input-dependent variable limits via **linear interpolation**:\n- For the fuel pressure (P) limits:\n - P_range = (1 − f) * [90, 120] + f * [110, 160]\n- For the variable geometry turbo rack position (G) limits:\n - G_range = (1 − f) * [0.2, 0.4] + f * [0.6, 0.9]\nThese bounds will be used for local sampling in the next task.\n\n### Task 4\nBased on the result from Task 2 and the given global inputs:\n- Engine speed: N = 1900 rpm\n- Fuel mass: F = 110 mg/stroke\nConstruct a **local design of experiments** using **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** over the following local inputs:\n- Injection (S):\n - Range: [-9, 3]\n - Unit: deg\n- Fuel pressure (P):\n - Range: P_range computed from Task 2\n - Unit: MPa\n- Variable geometry turbo rack position (G):\n - Range: G_range computed from Task 2\n - Unit: ratio\n- Exhaust gas recirculation valve lift (E):\n - Range: [0.5, 5]\n - Unit: mm\nYour design must contain **30 local samples** that respect the variable-specific bounds defined above.", "domain_topic": "Automotive Engineering: Engine Control and Calibration", "task_provider": "Yaxin Li", "evaluation_pipeline": "We will use exact code to evaluate the correctness of LLM responses.", "output_structure": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/YX_02/output_structure.py", "class": "Response_structure"}, "evaluator": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/YX_02/evaluate.py", "function": "evaluate_llm_response"}}

Thus, the target echoes arriving from the ranges within one pulse length from the radar or within one pulse length around the unambiguous range will be eclipsed by the transmitted pulse resulting in only a fraction of the pulse being received and processed.\nGiven the radar system with the pulse width of 11 microseconds, calcuate the closest range from which a full pulse can be received, Rmin.\nExpress the result in km, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain two decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n### Task 9\nEclipsing effect can also be observed for the targets located at or near the multiples of the unambiguous range.

Retain two decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n\n### Task 10\nAssume the radar system employs an electronically steered phased array to perform scanning. Using the phased array antenna will cause an increase in the required SNR due to two effects: 1. beam broadening due to the reduced projected array area in the beam direction, and 2. reduction of the effective aperture area of the individual array elements at off-broadside angles. To account for these effects, add the scan sector loss to the detectability factor. Assume that the system scans only in the azimuth dimension and the scan sector spans from –60 to 60 degrees. Assume the target is a fluctuating target. Given Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 1e-6, N = 10, compute the resultant loss.\nExpress the result in dB, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain four decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n\n### Task 11\nMoving target indicator (MTI) is a process of rejecting fixed or slowly moving clutter while passing echoes from targets moving with significant velocities. Typical MTI uses 2, 3, or 4-pulse canceller that implements a high-pass filter to reject echoes with low Doppler shifts. Passing the received signal through the MTI pulse canceller introduces correlation between the noise samples. This in turn reduces the total number of independent noise samples available for integration, resulting in MTI noise correlation loss. Additionally, the MTI canceller significantly suppresses targets with velocities close to the nulls of its frequency response, causing an additional MTI velocity response loss.\nAssume the target is a fluctuating target. Given Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 1e-6, N = 10. Assuming a 2-pulse canceller is used, calculate these two components of the MTI loss, the MTI noise correlation loss Lmti_a and the MTI velocity response loss Lmti_b.\nExpress the result in dB, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain four decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n### Task 12\nBinary integration is a suboptimal noncoherent integration technique also known as the M-of-N integration. If M out of N received pulses exceed a predetermined threshold, a target is declared to be present. The binary integrator is a relatively simple automatic detector and is less sensitive to the effects of a single large interference pulse that might exist along with the target echoes. Therefore, the binary integrator is more robust when the background noise or clutter is non-Gaussian. Since the binary integration is a suboptimal technique, it results in a binary integration loss compared to optimal noncoherent integration. The optimal value of M is not a sensitive selection and it can be quite different from the optimum without significant penalty resulting in the binary integration loss being lower than 1.4 dB.\nGiven Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 1e-6. Calculate the binary integration loss when N is 10 and M is set to 6.\nExpress the result in dB, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain four decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n### Task 13\nConstant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is used to maintain an approximately constant rate of false target detections when the noise or the interference levels vary. Since CFAR averages a finite number of reference cells to estimate the noise level, the estimates are subject to an error which leads to a CFAR loss. CFAR loss is an increase in the SNR required to achieve a desired detection performance using CFAR when the noise levels are unknown compared to a fixed threshold with a known noise level.\nCalculate the CFAR loss assuming that Pfa = 1e-6 and total 120 cells are used for cell-averaging CFAR.\nExpress the result in dB, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain four decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n\n### Task 14\nThe detectability factor reflects the minimum SNR required to detect a target under ideal conditions. However, practical radar systems experience additional signal processing and scanning losses.\nUsing the baseline detectability factor for a steady target with a single pulse from Task 2, and incorporating the following computed components:\n- Integration gain (Task 5)\n- Fluctuation loss (Task 6)\n- Beam shape loss = 1.2338 dB\n- Scan sector loss (Task 10)\n- MTI noise correlation loss and velocity response loss (Task 11)\n- Binary integration loss (Task 12)\n- CFAR loss (Task 13)\nCalculate the effective detectability factor by appropriately adjusting the baseline with gains and adding all losses.\nExpress the result in dB, and please specify the absolute error you believe exists between your result and the standard answer. Retain two decimal places. Round your result instead of truncating.\n\n### Task 15\nBased on the effective detectability factor calculated in Task 14, evaluate whether the radar system described in Task 1 — an S-band airport surveillance radar operating at 3 GHz with 0.2 MW peak transmit power, 34 dB antenna gain (Tx/Rx), 11 microseconds pulse duration, and a 4.1 dB noise figure — is capable of detecting a 1 m^2 RCS target at 100 km with Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 1e-6.\nCompare the available SNR from Task 1 with the required detectability factor from Task 14, and conclude whether the system satisfies the performance requirement.\nIf the system meets the requirement, return 1; if it does not, return 0.", "domain_topic": "Radar Engineering: Modeling Radar Detectability Factors", "task_provider": "Yaxin Li", "evaluation_pipeline": "We will use exact code to evaluate the correctness of LLM responses.", "output_structure": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/YX_03/output_structure.py", "class": "Response_structure"}, "evaluator": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/YX_03/evaluate.py", "function": "evaluate_llm_response"}}

Inter-core Connected AI Chip\n\nDeep learning accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, are widely recognized for their exceptional computing throughput (e.g., hundreds of Tera-FLOPS), making them ideal for handling large-scale models and high-dimensional data in deep learning. Such effectiveness is largely attributed to their massive parallel cores and specialized accelerator units, e.g., TensorCore. However, to saturate the high computing throughput, they usually require a high-throughput memory system, e.g., a large shared memory with multi-hierarchical cache layers in accelerators. Also, an efficient deep learning compiler [7, 8] is necessary to optimize data reuse across the memory hierarchy, ensuring the computing units are fully utilized. This combination of hardware and software design often yields orders of magnitude higher performance than traditional CPUs for critical deep learning operations, including matrix multiplication and convolution.\n\nDespite the success of existing accelerators, the constantly increasing demand for processing large deep-learning models with higher computation throughput presents a significant challenge to the underlying memory system. To address this challenge, the community is exploring a more scalable architecture with fully distributed memory, such as the Graphcore IPU [2], SambaNova SN10 [5], and Cerebras WSE [3]. Rather than relying on shared-memory architecture, they typically associate each computation core with local memory, and connect the cores via a high-bandwidth on-chip network, creating a large aggregated on-chip memory. However, this unique architecture renders previous deep learning compilers designed for shared-memory architectures, which cannot fully leverage the new architecture's scalability, resulting in significant memory waste.\n\nDesigning a deep learning compiler for distributed memory-based accelerators presents several unique challenges:\n1. Due to the absence of global shared memory, it is necessary to partition the operators, along with their input and output tensors, into sub-operators that can operate independently on each core with only local memory access.\n2. As the local memory on each core is mostly on-chip memory, the aggregated memory capacity is considerably smaller than the off-chip memory. Thus, the compiler must effectively utilize the limited memory capacity to support a model size as large as possible, without compromising on computing performance.\n3. Given that there is usually a trade-off between memory consumption and computation performance for each operator, an end-to-end model compilation must consider the trade-offs among all operators, generating a combinatorial optimization space that is infeasible to solve using existing compilers.\n\nIn this problem, we focus on a representative example of the inter-core connected AI chip: the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) MK2 [2]. An IPU chip has 1,472 cores, and each core executes independent threads in parallel with a private 624KB scratchpad memory, which adds up to a total of 896MB on-chip memory. Compared to the global shared memory architecture, a key distinction is that IPU cores are interconnected by high-bandwidth low-latency links. Each core can access the scratchpad memory of another core at 5.5GB/s, offering an aggregated inter-core all-to-all bandwidth of $1472 \\times 5.5$GB/s $\\approx 8$TB/s [1].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Background of T10\n\nTo eliminate the excessive memory footprint and redundant inter-core communications of VGM, we map the DNN computation to a _compute-shift_ pattern. In each step, each core independently computes a sub-task with data received from its upstream neighbors and shifts the data to its downstream. The feasibility of this approach for general DNNs comes from this observation: most DNN operators can be divided into regular computation tasks, which load and produce consecutive data tiles of the input and output tensors, respectively.\n\n![Figure 1](./images/figure1.png)\nFigure 1 shows an example that maps a MatMul operator to two cores with the compute-shift style execution. \nBoth (b) and (c) are valid compute-shift execution plans, but with different tradeoffs between memory footprint and communication overhead.\n\n**Example: Mapping MatMul to Two Cores**\nWe show an example that maps a matrix multiplication (MatMul) operator to two cores in Figure 1 (a).  \n1. **Partitioning:** We first partition the operator along dimension $m$ onto two cores in Figure 1 (b). By default, both cores hold a copy of the weight tensor, which incurs memory capacity overhead.  \n2. **Memory Optimization:** To reduce memory footprint, in Figure 1 (c), we further split the weight tensor along dimension $n$ into two parts and place each part on one of the cores. Then, the computation must be conducted in two steps, as each core holds half of the weight tensor and performs half of its computation per step. Between the computation steps, each core circularly shifts its partition to the next core, forming a shift ring of two cores.\n\n**Advantages of Compute-Shift Pattern**\n1. Eliminates the need for a global memory to store shared data, improving memory capacity utilization.  \n2. Evenly distributes communication volume across inter-core connections.  \n3. Aligns computation with data tile, avoiding redundant communications to many cores.\n\n**Tradeoff Between Memory Footprint and Communication Overhead**\nFor example, both Figure 1 (b) and (c) show valid execution plans:\n- **Plan (b):** Finishes the entire computation in one step without inter-core communication, but has a higher memory footprint.  \n- **Plan (c):** Has less memory footprint but incurs more communication overhead.\n\nIn reality, deriving the best tradeoff is challenging due to multi-dimensional DNN operators and thousands of cores on an IPU chip. An efficient compute-shift execution plan may contain numerous nested shift rings along multiple tensor dimensions, composing a massive tradeoff space to search through.\n\n---\n\n## 3. T10's Execution Plan Format\n\n### $r$Tensor: A New Tensor Abstraction\nT10 introduces a distributed tensor abstraction called RotatingTensor ($r$Tensor). $r$Tensor describes how each tensor is partitioned, mapped, and shifted on the interconnected cores (summarized in Table 1).\n\n**Table 1. Terminologies used in T10**\n| **Symbol** | **Name**                     | **Description**                                                               |\n|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `f_s^X`    | Spatial Partition Factor     | Spatially partitions a tensor X into sub-tensors.                             |\n| `f_t^X`    | Temporal Partition Factor    | Temporally partitions a sub-tensor of X into sub-tensor partitions.           |\n| `F_op`     | Operator Partition Factor    | Spatially partitions an entire operator into sub-operators.                   |\n\nFirst, T10 partitions the computation of an operator onto multiple cores. Based on the data dependency, the computation partitioning will imply how each of its input/output tensor is partitioned. This gives a spatial partition factor ($f_s$), which splits a tensor into sub-tensors. Second, each sub-tensor may be required by multiple cores. To share a sub-tensor among them, we specify how the sub-tensor is further partitioned among the cores using a temporal partition factor ($f_t$). $f_t$ also specifies how the partitions of a sub-tensor are circularly shifted among the cores. Altogether, a set of $r$Tensors of an operator defines a compute-shift execution plan. The numerous possible $r$Tensor configurations of an operator generate a huge search space of execution plans.\n\n![Figure 2](./images/figure2.png)\nFigure 2 shows the llustration of rTensor partitioning and rotating.\n\nSpecifically, $f_s$ and $f_t$ are vectors with a length equal to the number of dimensions of a tensor, indicating how the tensor is partitioned along each dimension. For example, in Figure 2 (a), a tensor $T$ of shape $[6,8]$ is partitioned onto 8 cores by a spatial factor $f_s=[2,1]$, forming 2 sub-tensors of shape $[3,8]$. Thus, to share each sub-tensor among 4 cores without incurring high memory footprint, a temporal factor $f_t=[1,2]$ further partitions each sub-tensor into 2 partitions with shape $[3,4]$, as shown in Figure 2 (b). It forms $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ rotation rings with 2 cores in each, where cores share the sub-tensor by circularly shifting its partitions. In comparison, Figure 2 (c) shows how another $f_t=[1,4]$ splits the same sub-tensor to 4 partitions, on $\\frac{4}{4}=1$ rotation ring with 4 cores.\n\n---\n\n## 3.2. Compute-Shift Execution Plan\n\nUsing the $r$Tensor abstraction, T10 organizes the computation of a general DNN operator into a compute-shift pattern, where the operator's computation and tensors are partitioned to individual cores and their local memories. The entire computation involves multiple compute-shift steps until each tensor has been shifted across all cores. Each compute step is defined as a *sub-task*. In each compute-shift step, each core computes a sub-task and shifts local tensors to its neighbors. We now discuss how T10 partitions DNN operators into compute-shift-based execution plans.\n\n### Operator representation.\nTo represent an operator's computation, T10 uses tensor expression [6], which defines how each output tensor value is computed from the input values. For example, a matrix multiplication of tensors $A$ in shape $[M,K]$ and $B$ in $[K,N]$ into $C$ is defined as\n\n$C[m,n] \\longleftarrow A[m,k]*B[k,n]$,\n\nwhere $m$, $k$, and $n$ are axes to index the elements in each tensor. Equation (1) indicates that any value in $C$ indexed by $m$ and $n$ (i.e., $C[m,n]$) is computed by summing $A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ over all possible indices $k$. T10 supports all common operators, like MatMult and Convolution, from DNN workloads in both inference and training. For a few special cases like Sort, which cannot be represented in tensor expression, T10 uses the implementations from the vendor library.\n\n### Partitioning an operator.\nTo map an operator to interconnected cores, T10 first partitions it into parallel *sub-operators* along all unique axes in its tensor expression, using an *operator partition factor* ($F_{op}$). For example, Equation (1) contains axes $m$, $k$, and $n$, then $F_{op}$ is a vector of three integer factors specifying how the three axes are spatially partitioned. The total number of sub-operators is the product of all elements in $F_{op}$. For example, $F_{op}=[2,1,4]$ for $[m,k,n]$ slices the operator into 8 sub-operators on 8 cores, each computing a $\\lceil\\frac{M}{2},\\frac{K}{1}\\rceil \\times \\lceil\\frac{K}{1},\\frac{N}{4}\\rceil$ sub-matrix multiplication.\n\n### Partitioning $r$Tensors.\nT10 then uses $F_{op}$ to derive the spatial partition factor $f_s$ for each tensor, following the data dependencies in tensor expression. With the same example, for $F_{op}=[2,1,4]$ on $[m,k,n]$, the spatial partition factor for the tensor A is $f_s^A=[2,1]$ for axes $m$ and $k$. Similarly, for tensors B and C, we have $f_s^B=[1,4]$ and $f_s^C=[2,4]$.\n\nIf a tensor's dimensions do not include some axis in $F_{op}$, each of the sliced sub-tensors is required by multiple sub-operators along the missing axis. Thus, once the spatial factor determines the number of cores that will share a sub-tensor, the temporal factor determines how we split the sub-tensor across these cores into rotation ring(s). In the above example, $F_{op}$ partitions the entire operator onto $2 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 8$ cores, and $f_s^B$ spatially partitions tensor B into $1 \\times 4 = 4$ sub-tensors. Thus, each sub-tensor is shared by $P=\\frac{8}{4}=2$ cores. Then, a temporal factor $f_t^B=[2,1]$ further splits each sub-tensor into $2 \\times 1 = 2$ partitions, forming $\\frac{P}{2}=1$ rotation ring.\n\nT10 enforces that the product of elements in $f_t$, or $\\prod f_t$, is a divisor of the number of cores that shares the sub-tensor ($P$), so that the number of rotation rings (i.e., $\\frac{P}{\\prod f_t}$) is an integer. If there is more than one rotation ring, we replicate each sub-tensor $\\frac{P}{\\prod f_t}$ times to ensure that each ring shares one copy of the sub-tensor. While the duplication consumes memory space, it may reduce the number of rotation steps by allowing a larger sub-task on each core at each step, which enables a trade-off between memory usage and communication cost.\n\n![Figure 3](./images/figure3.png)\nFigure 3 shows an example of the rotation of rTensor.\nThe compute-shift executions of the sub-operators need to be aligned.\n\n### Aligning the rotations of $r$Tensors.\nSince a general DNN operator can have various tensor shapes, a naive partitioning plan can easily cause the tensor shifting and the sub-task computing at an unaligned pace. In Figure 3 (a), we still use the MatMult operator in Equation (1) as an example. We partition it into a $2 \\times 4$ grid in Figure 3 (b), with the specified partition factors. Note that both A and B are temporally partitioned along axis $k$, but with different $f_t$ factors.\n\nThe rotating paces of tensors in one operator must be aligned to ensure correct data dependency. In Figure 3 (b), tensors A and B are shifted with different paces along axis $k$. To synchronizes the paces, each core shifts A for 2 times along $k$ for each time B is shifted, and computes a sub-task (i.e., a sub-MatMult) of shape $[\\text{m=1, k=1, n=1}]$ for each time A is shifted. This requires 4 compute steps to finish the sub-operator on this core, where A is shifted after each step and B is shifted every 2 steps.\n\n### Alignment constraints.\nTo ensure that a $r$Tensor configuration can be translated into a valid execution plan, the product of the temporal partition factors of a tensor (i.e., the total number of temporal partitions) should be a factor of the replication number caused by spatial partitioning. Additionally, for different tensors of an operator that share a common dimension, all their temporal factors on this dimension should be aligned. Thus, any pair of temporal factors should be a factor or multiple of each other. This approach allows each tensor or sub-tensor to flow across cores at a different pace, while ensuring that corresponding tensor partitions can meet at the same time step on a specific core. For instance, in the matrix multiplication illustrated in Figure 3(b), tensor A has a temporal factor of 4 along dimension $k$, tensor B has a factor of 2, and these factors along $k$ (i.e., 4 and 2) must be a factor or multiple of each other.\n\n### Sub-operator scheduling.\nWith the above constraints, we can organize an operator's computation into a valid compute-shift execution plan. At each step, each sub-operator computes a sub-task partitioned by $F_{op}$ and the $f_t$ along each axis. Each sub-operator iterates over all its sub-tasks by nested-looping through the axes of this operator. Between sub-tasks, an $r$Tensor is rotated along the currently iterating axis for all its sub-tensors, until all sub-tasks are enumerated.\n\nSpecifically, T10 organizes the computation on each core as nested loops of interleaved compute and shift stages. Each loop corresponds to a temporally partitioned dimension. For example, if there are two dimensions to shift, $m$ and $n$, with $m$ shifting twice and $n$ shifting once, then there are two valid 5-time shift schedules: (1) $m$ is the inner loop, i.e., $\\text{shift}(m) \\times 2 \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\times 2$; and (2) $n$ is the inner loop, i.e., $\\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n)$. To determine the optimal loop order, T10 designates the dimension belonging to the tensor with the smaller size as the inner loop to reduce the total communication volume, as the inner loop is executed more times. To generate local computations for each core, T10 invokes the corresponding compute function with the partition configuration and the tensor expression.\n\n---\n\n# References\n[1] Zhe Jia, Blake Tillman, Marco Maggioni, and Daniele Paolo Scarpazza. 2019.

To address this challenge, the community is exploring a more scalable architecture with fully distributed memory, such as the Graphcore IPU [2], SambaNova SN10 [5], and Cerebras WSE [3]. Rather than relying on shared-memory architecture, they typically associate each computation core with local memory, and connect the cores via a high-bandwidth on-chip network, creating a large aggregated on-chip memory. However, this unique architecture renders previous deep learning compilers designed for shared-memory architectures, which cannot fully leverage the new architecture's scalability, resulting in significant memory waste.\n\nDesigning a deep learning compiler for distributed memory-based accelerators presents several unique challenges:\n1. Due to the absence of global shared memory, it is necessary to partition the operators, along with their input and output tensors, into sub-operators that can operate independently on each core with only local memory access.\n2. As the local memory on each core is mostly on-chip memory, the aggregated memory capacity is considerably smaller than the off-chip memory. Thus, the compiler must effectively utilize the limited memory capacity to support a model size as large as possible, without compromising on computing performance.\n3. Given that there is usually a trade-off between memory consumption and computation performance for each operator, an end-to-end model compilation must consider the trade-offs among all operators, generating a combinatorial optimization space that is infeasible to solve using existing compilers.\n\nIn this problem, we focus on a representative example of the inter-core connected AI chip: the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) MK2 [2]. An IPU chip has 1,472 cores, and each core executes independent threads in parallel with a private 624KB scratchpad memory, which adds up to a total of 896MB on-chip memory. Compared to the global shared memory architecture, a key distinction is that IPU cores are interconnected by high-bandwidth low-latency links. Each core can access the scratchpad memory of another core at 5.5GB/s, offering an aggregated inter-core all-to-all bandwidth of $1472 \\times 5.5$GB/s $\\approx 8$TB/s [1].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Background of T10\n\nTo eliminate the excessive memory footprint and redundant inter-core communications of VGM, we map the DNN computation to a _compute-shift_ pattern. In each step, each core independently computes a sub-task with data received from its upstream neighbors and shifts the data to its downstream. The feasibility of this approach for general DNNs comes from this observation: most DNN operators can be divided into regular computation tasks, which load and produce consecutive data tiles of the input and output tensors, respectively.\n\n![Figure 1](./images/figure1.png)\nFigure 1 shows an example that maps a MatMul operator to two cores with the compute-shift style execution. \nBoth (b) and (c) are valid compute-shift execution plans, but with different tradeoffs between memory footprint and communication overhead.\n\n**Example: Mapping MatMul to Two Cores**\nWe show an example that maps a matrix multiplication (MatMul) operator to two cores in Figure 1 (a).  \n1. **Partitioning:** We first partition the operator along dimension $m$ onto two cores in Figure 1 (b). By default, both cores hold a copy of the weight tensor, which incurs memory capacity overhead.  \n2. **Memory Optimization:** To reduce memory footprint, in Figure 1 (c), we further split the weight tensor along dimension $n$ into two parts and place each part on one of the cores. Then, the computation must be conducted in two steps, as each core holds half of the weight tensor and performs half of its computation per step. Between the computation steps, each core circularly shifts its partition to the next core, forming a shift ring of two cores.\n\n**Advantages of Compute-Shift Pattern**\n1. Eliminates the need for a global memory to store shared data, improving memory capacity utilization.  \n2. Evenly distributes communication volume across inter-core connections.  \n3. Aligns computation with data tile, avoiding redundant communications to many cores.\n\n**Tradeoff Between Memory Footprint and Communication Overhead**\nFor example, both Figure 1 (b) and (c) show valid execution plans:\n- **Plan (b):** Finishes the entire computation in one step without inter-core communication, but has a higher memory footprint.  \n- **Plan (c):** Has less memory footprint but incurs more communication overhead.\n\nIn reality, deriving the best tradeoff is challenging due to multi-dimensional DNN operators and thousands of cores on an IPU chip. An efficient compute-shift execution plan may contain numerous nested shift rings along multiple tensor dimensions, composing a massive tradeoff space to search through.\n\n---\n\n## 3. T10's Execution Plan Format\n\n### $r$Tensor: A New Tensor Abstraction\nT10 introduces a distributed tensor abstraction called RotatingTensor ($r$Tensor). $r$Tensor describes how each tensor is partitioned, mapped, and shifted on the interconnected cores (summarized in Table 1).\n\n**Table 1. Terminologies used in T10**\n| **Symbol** | **Name**                     | **Description**                                                               |\n|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `f_s^X`    | Spatial Partition Factor     | Spatially partitions a tensor X into sub-tensors.                             |\n| `f_t^X`    | Temporal Partition Factor    | Temporally partitions a sub-tensor of X into sub-tensor partitions.           |\n| `F_op`     | Operator Partition Factor    | Spatially partitions an entire operator into sub-operators.                   |\n\nFirst, T10 partitions the computation of an operator onto multiple cores. Based on the data dependency, the computation partitioning will imply how each of its input/output tensor is partitioned. This gives a spatial partition factor ($f_s$), which splits a tensor into sub-tensors. Second, each sub-tensor may be required by multiple cores. To share a sub-tensor among them, we specify how the sub-tensor is further partitioned among the cores using a temporal partition factor ($f_t$). $f_t$ also specifies how the partitions of a sub-tensor are circularly shifted among the cores. Altogether, a set of $r$Tensors of an operator defines a compute-shift execution plan. The numerous possible $r$Tensor configurations of an operator generate a huge search space of execution plans.\n\n![Figure 2](./images/figure2.png)\nFigure 2 shows the llustration of rTensor partitioning and rotating.\n\nSpecifically, $f_s$ and $f_t$ are vectors with a length equal to the number of dimensions of a tensor, indicating how the tensor is partitioned along each dimension. For example, in Figure 2 (a), a tensor $T$ of shape $[6,8]$ is partitioned onto 8 cores by a spatial factor $f_s=[2,1]$, forming 2 sub-tensors of shape $[3,8]$. Thus, to share each sub-tensor among 4 cores without incurring high memory footprint, a temporal factor $f_t=[1,2]$ further partitions each sub-tensor into 2 partitions with shape $[3,4]$, as shown in Figure 2 (b). It forms $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ rotation rings with 2 cores in each, where cores share the sub-tensor by circularly shifting its partitions. In comparison, Figure 2 (c) shows how another $f_t=[1,4]$ splits the same sub-tensor to 4 partitions, on $\\frac{4}{4}=1$ rotation ring with 4 cores.\n\n---\n\n## 3.2. Compute-Shift Execution Plan\n\nUsing the $r$Tensor abstraction, T10 organizes the computation of a general DNN operator into a compute-shift pattern, where the operator's computation and tensors are partitioned to individual cores and their local memories. The entire computation involves multiple compute-shift steps until each tensor has been shifted across all cores. Each compute step is defined as a *sub-task*. In each compute-shift step, each core computes a sub-task and shifts local tensors to its neighbors. We now discuss how T10 partitions DNN operators into compute-shift-based execution plans.\n\n### Operator representation.\nTo represent an operator's computation, T10 uses tensor expression [6], which defines how each output tensor value is computed from the input values. For example, a matrix multiplication of tensors $A$ in shape $[M,K]$ and $B$ in $[K,N]$ into $C$ is defined as\n\n$C[m,n] \\longleftarrow A[m,k]*B[k,n]$,\n\nwhere $m$, $k$, and $n$ are axes to index the elements in each tensor. Equation (1) indicates that any value in $C$ indexed by $m$ and $n$ (i.e., $C[m,n]$) is computed by summing $A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ over all possible indices $k$. T10 supports all common operators, like MatMult and Convolution, from DNN workloads in both inference and training. For a few special cases like Sort, which cannot be represented in tensor expression, T10 uses the implementations from the vendor library.\n\n### Partitioning an operator.\nTo map an operator to interconnected cores, T10 first partitions it into parallel *sub-operators* along all unique axes in its tensor expression, using an *operator partition factor* ($F_{op}$). For example, Equation (1) contains axes $m$, $k$, and $n$, then $F_{op}$ is a vector of three integer factors specifying how the three axes are spatially partitioned. The total number of sub-operators is the product of all elements in $F_{op}$. For example, $F_{op}=[2,1,4]$ for $[m,k,n]$ slices the operator into 8 sub-operators on 8 cores, each computing a $\\lceil\\frac{M}{2},\\frac{K}{1}\\rceil \\times \\lceil\\frac{K}{1},\\frac{N}{4}\\rceil$ sub-matrix multiplication.\n\n### Partitioning $r$Tensors.\nT10 then uses $F_{op}$ to derive the spatial partition factor $f_s$ for each tensor, following the data dependencies in tensor expression. With the same example, for $F_{op}=[2,1,4]$ on $[m,k,n]$, the spatial partition factor for the tensor A is $f_s^A=[2,1]$ for axes $m$ and $k$. Similarly, for tensors B and C, we have $f_s^B=[1,4]$ and $f_s^C=[2,4]$.\n\nIf a tensor's dimensions do not include some axis in $F_{op}$, each of the sliced sub-tensors is required by multiple sub-operators along the missing axis. Thus, once the spatial factor determines the number of cores that will share a sub-tensor, the temporal factor determines how we split the sub-tensor across these cores into rotation ring(s). In the above example, $F_{op}$ partitions the entire operator onto $2 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 8$ cores, and $f_s^B$ spatially partitions tensor B into $1 \\times 4 = 4$ sub-tensors. Thus, each sub-tensor is shared by $P=\\frac{8}{4}=2$ cores. Then, a temporal factor $f_t^B=[2,1]$ further splits each sub-tensor into $2 \\times 1 = 2$ partitions, forming $\\frac{P}{2}=1$ rotation ring.\n\nT10 enforces that the product of elements in $f_t$, or $\\prod f_t$, is a divisor of the number of cores that shares the sub-tensor ($P$), so that the number of rotation rings (i.e., $\\frac{P}{\\prod f_t}$) is an integer. If there is more than one rotation ring, we replicate each sub-tensor $\\frac{P}{\\prod f_t}$ times to ensure that each ring shares one copy of the sub-tensor. While the duplication consumes memory space, it may reduce the number of rotation steps by allowing a larger sub-task on each core at each step, which enables a trade-off between memory usage and communication cost.\n\n![Figure 3](./images/figure3.png)\nFigure 3 shows an example of the rotation of rTensor.\nThe compute-shift executions of the sub-operators need to be aligned.\n\n### Aligning the rotations of $r$Tensors.\nSince a general DNN operator can have various tensor shapes, a naive partitioning plan can easily cause the tensor shifting and the sub-task computing at an unaligned pace. In Figure 3 (a), we still use the MatMult operator in Equation (1) as an example. We partition it into a $2 \\times 4$ grid in Figure 3 (b), with the specified partition factors. Note that both A and B are temporally partitioned along axis $k$, but with different $f_t$ factors.\n\nThe rotating paces of tensors in one operator must be aligned to ensure correct data dependency. In Figure 3 (b), tensors A and B are shifted with different paces along axis $k$. To synchronizes the paces, each core shifts A for 2 times along $k$ for each time B is shifted, and computes a sub-task (i.e., a sub-MatMult) of shape $[\\text{m=1, k=1, n=1}]$ for each time A is shifted. This requires 4 compute steps to finish the sub-operator on this core, where A is shifted after each step and B is shifted every 2 steps.\n\n### Alignment constraints.\nTo ensure that a $r$Tensor configuration can be translated into a valid execution plan, the product of the temporal partition factors of a tensor (i.e., the total number of temporal partitions) should be a factor of the replication number caused by spatial partitioning. Additionally, for different tensors of an operator that share a common dimension, all their temporal factors on this dimension should be aligned. Thus, any pair of temporal factors should be a factor or multiple of each other. This approach allows each tensor or sub-tensor to flow across cores at a different pace, while ensuring that corresponding tensor partitions can meet at the same time step on a specific core. For instance, in the matrix multiplication illustrated in Figure 3(b), tensor A has a temporal factor of 4 along dimension $k$, tensor B has a factor of 2, and these factors along $k$ (i.e., 4 and 2) must be a factor or multiple of each other.\n\n### Sub-operator scheduling.\nWith the above constraints, we can organize an operator's computation into a valid compute-shift execution plan. At each step, each sub-operator computes a sub-task partitioned by $F_{op}$ and the $f_t$ along each axis. Each sub-operator iterates over all its sub-tasks by nested-looping through the axes of this operator. Between sub-tasks, an $r$Tensor is rotated along the currently iterating axis for all its sub-tensors, until all sub-tasks are enumerated.\n\nSpecifically, T10 organizes the computation on each core as nested loops of interleaved compute and shift stages. Each loop corresponds to a temporally partitioned dimension. For example, if there are two dimensions to shift, $m$ and $n$, with $m$ shifting twice and $n$ shifting once, then there are two valid 5-time shift schedules: (1) $m$ is the inner loop, i.e., $\\text{shift}(m) \\times 2 \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\times 2$; and (2) $n$ is the inner loop, i.e., $\\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(m) \\rightarrow \\text{shift}(n)$. To determine the optimal loop order, T10 designates the dimension belonging to the tensor with the smaller size as the inner loop to reduce the total communication volume, as the inner loop is executed more times. To generate local computations for each core, T10 invokes the corresponding compute function with the partition configuration and the tensor expression.\n\n---\n\n# References\n[1] Zhe Jia, Blake Tillman, Marco Maggioni, and Daniele Paolo Scarpazza. 2019.

{"id": "Yuqi_01", "prompt": "## Neural Processing Unit Architecture\nNeural processing units (NPUs) are specialized accelerators for machine learning (ML) workloads. A typical example is Google TPU [1,2], the state-of-the-art NPU architecture widely deployed in production.\nIt consists of weight-stationary systolic arrays (SAs) for matrix multiplications and convolutions, and SIMD vector units (VUs) for generic vector operations.\nAn SA consists of a 2D array of processing elements (PEs) that are connected in a mesh topology. Each PE can perform a multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation.\nEach VU takes 8$\\times$128$ vectors as inputs and can output a 8$\\times$128$ vector per cycle.\nEach chip has an off-chip high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to store the ML model weights and input/output data, and an on-chip SRAM to exploit on-chip data reuse and hide HBM access latency.\nA DMA engine performs asynchronous memory copy between the HBM and SRAM, and the DMA operation are performed in parallel with the computation in the SAs and VUs.\nMultiple NPU chips can be interconnected via high-speed inter-chip interconnect (ICI) links, which form an NPU pod. The NPU chips in a pod are arranged as a 3D torus, which is optimized for all-reduce bandwidth [3,10]. The DMA engine performs peer-to-peer RDMA operations to access another chip's HBM or SRAM.\n\n\n## Distributed Large Language Model Serving\nLarge language models (LLMs) are auto-regressive transformer-based language models.\nTo serve an input request, the LLM performs two stages of computations: prefill and decode.\nDuring prefill, the LLM computes the forward pass for the input sequence and generate the key-value (KV) cache for each input token. It also generates the first output token.\nDuring decode, the LLM iteratively generates the next output token based on the KV cache of the input tokens and the previously generated output tokens.\nIn state-of-the-art LLM serving systems, the prefill and decode stages are disaggregated and performed in a pipelined manner.\nTherefore, we can treat the prefill and decode stages as two separate workloads and optimize them independently.\n\nSince the LLM is too large to fit into a single NPU chip, we need to shard the model weights, KV cache, and activation tensors across multiple chips.\nTypically, there are three tunable sharding parameters: data parallelism (DP), tensor parallelism (TP), and pipeline parallelism (PP).\n\nIn DP, the input batch is sharded across chips such that each chip independently computes the forward pass for its own local batch.\n\nIn TP, the model weights are sharded across chips follwing the Megatron-LM approach [6]. For the attention layers, each attention head is assigned to a different chip. For the FFN layers, the FNN matrices are sharded across chips, and it requires all-reduce (or reduce-scatter plus all-gather) communication to aggregate the final output of the FNN layers.\n\nIn PP, different transformer layers in the LLM are assigned to different chips, forming a pipeline. There will be peer-to-peer (P2P) inter-chip communications to receive and send the input/output tensors of each pipeline stage.\n\n\n## SLO Metrics for LLM Serving\nFor prefill, the latency SLO metric is the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for each request, which is the time taken to process all input tokens of the request.\nFor decode, the latency SLO metric is the time-per-output-token (TPOT) for each request, which is the time taken to generate each output token.\nFor both prefill and decode, the throughput metric is tokens per second, which is the number of tokens processed per second.\n\n\n## Task Description\nIn this task, you will act as a computer architect to tune the hardware specifications of a neural processing unit (NPU). You are given a large language model (LLM) inference workload with the average input and output sequence lengths for each request. You first need to determine some critical architectural parameters for each NPU chip.\nThen, you will consider deploying the given LLM workload at scale. You need to act as the cluster NPU allocator [4,5] to figure out how to allocate NPU resourcess to the given workload.\nSpecifically, you need to tune the NPU cluster configuration for serving the given LLM workload, including the number of chips, network topology, the model shardings, and the batch size, to meet latency and throughput service-level objective (SLO) constraints.\nFor the following tasks, assume each task is independent, and you do not need to consider the previous tasks when answering the next task.\n\n### Task 1: Systolic Array (SA) Width\nWe want to first decide the width of the SA based on the tensor operator semantics in the LLM model. Assume the SA is square.\nConsider a matrix multiplication operator $C = A \\times B$, where the input matrix $A$ is of size $m \\times k$, the input matrix $B$ is of size $k \\times n$, and the output matrix $C$ is of size $m \\times n$.\nFor a weight-stationary SA, if $m$ is less than its width, the SA will be diagonally underutilized; if $n$ is less than its width, some columns in the SA will be underutilized; if $k$ is less than its width, some rows in the SA will be underutilized.\nThe SA is fully utilized when $m$, $k$, and $n$ are all greater than or equal to its width.\nConsider a specific matrix multiplication operator where $m=1024$, $k=128$, and $n=128$.\nIf we want to make sure the FLOPs (floating-point operations) per second utilization of the SA is at least 70%, what is the maximum width of the SA?\nYour answer should be a a positive integer, which is the width of the SA.\n\n### Task 2: HBM Bandwidth\nNow we tune the memory subsystem.\nSpecifically, we need to determine how much HBM bandwidth is required to avoid stalling the computation.\nSuppose we have four SAs, each with width 128 and running at 940 MHz.\nFor simplicity, assume the SRAM bandwidth is infinite, and the VUs will not be a performance bottleneck.\nConsider a matrix multiplication operator $C = A \\times B$, where the input matrix $A$ is of size $m \\times k$, the input matrix $B$ is of size $k \\times n$, and the output matrix $C$ is of size $m \\times n$.\nWe perform tiled matrix multiplication [7] to exploit on-chip data reuse and reduce the HBM bandwidth pressure.\nEach SA computes separate output tiles.\nYou may refer to the JAX documentation [9] for the tiling strategy for multiple SAs on an NPU.\nThe tile size is restricted by the SRAM size, and we need to keep at least 10 tiles in the SRAM for each SA, in order to hide the HBM access latency.\nAssume the on-chip SRAM is 32 MB, and all elements in the matrices are float16 (2 bytes).\nFor a matrix multiplication operator where $m=4096$, $k=8192$, and $n=28672$, what is the minimum required HBM bandwidth in GB/s (including both read and write traffic) such that the SA computation will not be stalled?\n\n### Task 3: NPU Allocations for Prefill and Decode\nConsider an NPU chip with the following specifications:\n{\n    \"num_sa\": 8,\n    \"num_vu\": 6,\n    \"hbm_bw_GBps\": 2765,\n    \"vmem_size_MB\": 128,\n    \"freq_GHz\": 1.75,\n    \"sa_dim\": 128,\n    \"hbm_size_GB\": 95,\n    \"ici_link_bw_GBps\": 100,\n}\nwhere \"num_sa\" is the number of SAs, \"num_vu\" is the number of VUs, \"hbm_bw_GBps\" is the HBM bandwidth in GB/s, \"vmem_size_MB\" is the size of the on-chip SRAM in MB, \"freq_GHz\" is the frequency of the chip in GHz, \"sa_dim\" is the width of the SA, \"hbm_size_GB\" is the size of the HBM in GB, and \"ici_link_bw_GBps\" is the bandwidth of each ICI link in GB/s.\nEach NPU chip has 6 ICI links that are directly connected to 6 neighboring chips, and all NPU chips in an NPU pod are connected in a 3D torus topology.\nYou are given the Llama3.1-405B LLM model, and you need to find the optimal NPU pod configuration and the optimal model sharding and batch size for serving the LLM model. The detailed model specifications are as follows:\n{\n    \"d_model\": 16384,\n    \"num_heads\": 128,\n    \"d_head\": 128,\n    \"num_kv_heads\": 8,\n    \"d_ff\": 53248,\n    \"num_layers\": 126,\n    \"use_flash_attention\": true,\n}\nwhere \"d_model\" is the embedding dimension, \"num_heads\" is the number of attention heads, \"d_head\" is the dimension of each attention head, \"num_kv_heads\" is the number of key-value heads (for grouped-query attention), \"d_ff\" is the hidden dimension of the feed-forward network (FFN), \"num_layers\" is the number of transformer layers, and \"use_flash_attention\" indicates whether to use flash attention [8] (only used for prefill) or not.\nThe average input sequence length is 4096 tokens for prefill, and the average output sequence length is 512 tokens for decode.\nThe latency SLO is 500 ms TTFT for prefill and 20 ms TPOT for decode.\nAssume we have a 4$\\times$4$\\times$4 NPU pod for prefill, and another 4$\\times$4$\\times$4 NPU pod for decode. Please find the optimal allocations for each of them to achieve the best throughput (tokens per second), while ensuring that the latency SLO is met.\nYou should output two allocations plans, one for prefill and one for decode.\nEach allocation plan should include the following parameters:\n    - DP: data parallelism degree. Must be a multiple of 2.\n    - TP: tensor parallelism degree. Must be a multiple of 2.\n    - PP: pipeline parallelism degree. Must be a multiple of 2.\n    - batch_size: the number of requests in a batch. Must be a power of 2.\n    - mem_per_chip_GB: the HBM memory footprint on each NPU chip in GB.\nYou need to ensure that the product of DP, TP, and PP does not exceed 64 chips (but each parallelism degree can exceed 4 by taking multiple ICI axes).

Environment}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $K \\in \\mathbb{N}$ denotes the number of arms.\n    \\item Let $L \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and $T = L*K$ is the fixed time horizon.\n    \\item Each arm $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ produces i.i.d.\\ rewards drawn from an unknown, $1$-sub-Gaussian distribution $P_i$ with mean $\\mu_i \\in [0,1]$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{2. Interaction processes}\n\nAt each round $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$, the learner selects an arm $a_t \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$, which corresponds to administering a particular treatment (e.g., giving a specific drug to a patient). After pulling arm $a_t$, the learner observes a reward $r_t \\sim P_{a_t}$. \n\n\\subsection*{3. Cumulative regret}\nOne important performance metric in MAB problems is the cumulative regret, which ideally should be as small as possible; a lower cumulative regret often indicates better overall welfare of the patients. The definition of the regret is:\n    \\[\n        R_T \\;:=\\;\n        \\mathbb{E}\\!\\Bigl[\\, \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\bigl(\\mu^\\ast - \\mu_{a_t}\\bigr) \\Bigr],\n        \\quad\n        \\mu^\\ast \\;:=\\; \\max_{1\\le i \\le K} \\mu_i .\n    \\]\n\n\\subsection*{4. Average treatment effect (ATE)}\nThe ATE quantifies the difference in expected outcomes between two treatments (or arms). Estimating the ATE allows us to identify the performance of each treatment. \n\nFor any two arms $i,j$ define the true ATE\n\\[\n    \\Delta_{ij} \\;:=\\; \\mu_i \\;-\\; \\mu_j .\n\\]\nFor arm $i$ the reward estimator after $T$ iterations is $\\hat{\\mu}_i$. The empirical ATE between arms $i$ and $j$ is\n\\[\n    \\hat{\\Delta}_{ij} \\;:=\\; \\hat{\\mu}_i \\;-\\; \\hat{\\mu}_j.\n\\]\nBesides, we define the maximum ATE estimation error after $T$ rounds as\n    \\[\n        \\hat{\\Delta}_T \\;:=\\;\n        \\max_{1 \\le i < j \\le K}\n        \\bigl| \\, \\hat{\\Delta}_{ij} - \\Delta_{ij} \\, \\bigr|.\n    \\]\nWe aim for the $\\hat{\\Delta}_T$ to be as small as possible.\n\n\\subsection*{5. Performance Quantities}\nMinimizing both cumulative regret and ATE estimation error is essential to balance effective decision-making with accurate statistical inference. Low regret indicates that the learner is consistently selecting high-performing arms and thus achieving strong reward performance. At the same time, a small ATE estimation error enables reliable comparisons between treatments, which is critical for understanding their relative effectiveness. To capture this trade-off, we aim to minimize the following objective:\n    \\[\n        J \\;:=\\;\n        \\mathbb{E}\\!\\bigl[ \\sqrt{R_T} \\bigr]\n        \\;\\cdot\\;\n        \\mathbb{E}\\!\\bigl[ \\hat{\\Delta}_T \\bigr].\n    \\]\nWe want to design a learning algorithm that can minimize $J$.\n\n\\subsection*{6. Two--phase algorithm design}\nWe aim to design a two-phase algorithm to minimize \\(J\\). Let \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) satisfy \\(1 \\le K^{\\alpha}L^{\\beta} \\le T\\). The algorithm proceeds in two stages: an initial uniform exploration phase, followed by an adaptive exploitation phase based on the collected data.\n\n\\paragraph{Exploration phase (rounds $1,\\dots,K^{\\alpha}L^{\\beta}$).}\nPull every arm in a round--robin fashion.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Exploitation phase (rounds $K^{\\alpha}L^{\\beta}+1,\\dots,T$).}\nRun the standard UCB rule.\n\nThe resulting $J$ is denoted $J(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\n  \n### Task \n\nHere we analyze the asymptotic behavior of $J$, focusing only on the constants $K$ and $L$, ignoring the logarithmic term and other constant factors.\n\n \\textbf{Goal:} Find the upper bounds and lower bounds of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ $\\{\\bar\\alpha,\\bar\\beta,\\underline{\\alpha},\\underline{\\beta}\\}$ such that\n \\[\n        \\forall \\alpha \\in [\\bar\\alpha,\\underline{\\alpha}],\\ \\forall \\beta\\in[\\bar\\beta,\\underline{\\beta}];\\quad J(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\min_{x,y \\in S} J(x,y) \n \\]\n where\n \\[\n        S \\;:=\\; \\bigl\\{\\, \\alpha,\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R} \\,:\\; 1 \\le K^{\\alpha}L^\\beta \\le T \\bigr\\}.\n \\]", "domain_topic": "Main domain: Online decision making\nSub domain: Multi-armed bandits", "task_provider": "Zichen Wang", "evaluation_pipeline": "We will use exact MATLAB code (verifybounds.m) to evaluate the correctness of LLM responses.", "output_structure": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/ZC_03/output_structure.py", "class": "Response_structure"}, "evaluator": {"path": "evals/eng-design/EngDesign-Open/ZC_03/evaluate.py", "function": "evaluate_llm_response"}}
