The question is why this happens?\n\nThe answer should be in a paragraph.\n\n**A**\n**B**\n**C**\n**D**\n\nLet me think about it... When you increase the ambient temperature, the air becomes warmer and less dense. This causes the air to rise more easily due to buoyancy forces.

The answer to this question lies in the fact that when materials are cooled below their melting point, they undergo phase changes which can lead to microstructural changes. For example, when cooling down from room temperature (25\u00b0C) to 0\u00b0C, some materials may experience a decrease in ductility due to the loss of dislocations or other structural features.\n\nIn addition to these general effects, there are specific cases where certain types of materials exhibit different behaviors under such conditions.
