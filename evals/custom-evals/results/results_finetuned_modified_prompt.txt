Assumption: The internal structure of the pack does not change during flight and
remains rigidly fixed relative to its frame.
Failure mode: Internal deformation or structural failure from thermal cycling
causing loss of electrical contact and possible leakage.
Failure mechanism: Thermal fatigue cracking under repeated high-temperature
cycles, which progressively removes insulation and weakens electrical connections.

Assumptions broken if temperature exceeds what range:
- Assumes constant material properties through life
- Assumes negligible radiation effects (insulation covers main radiative areas)
- Assumes uniform cell voltage across the module
- Assumes stable airflow patterns over long mission duration
- Assumes intact protective coatings and seals

If
===================
a2
the radiation model assumes no radiative transfer with absorption/emission at
interfaces; if panels or structures absorb solar energy during a day, internal
heat generation will be ignored, so local temperatures rise while global averages
remain unchanged. this can create localized hot spots that accelerate structural
heating and may trigger material degradation before global temperatures stabilize.
the conduction–convection coupling assumption: when panels conduct more heat into
the ground than assumed, surface temps fall slower than expected, reducing local
melting risk but increasing ground cooling and stability.
local geometry and contact details: small changes in panel shape or adhesion alter
local convective performance and can shift melt locations from near-s

-specifically, what failure mechanisms and stability limits would be lost if the
polymer used in this case were to undergo a thermal shock or temperature-dependent
change?

The answer should include how changing stiffness affects impact resistance and
crack initiation, which changes where failures will occur, and how reduced
toughness can shift brittle-to-plastic transition points so cracks prefer plastic
paths instead of fracture.

Assumptions:
- homogeneous, isotropic material property set across temperature range
- negligible strain-rate sensitivity compared with kinetic effects
- constant elastic modulus despite microstructural evolution under stress
- stable interface bonding throughout the service window
- uniform internal pressure and no local geometry sensitization
===================
a4
panel stiffness remains constant with temperature, no permanent deformation or
crack initiation, and the fluid/air film stays thin so viscous effects are
negligible.

If any of those assumptions break down, how does that affect predicted response?

Assuming stiffness constants remain fixed over life
Stiffness loss reduces maximum deflection and accelerates local stress
concentrations at edges.
Local stress concentration can initiate micro-cracks before global displacements
reach critical levels.
Micro-crack growth alters local geometry and redistributes stresses away from
assumed modes.
Growth can switch load paths and cause sudden overload in a chain-of-loads
scenario.
Thermal coupling between components and surroundings changes
===================
a5
A) The air flow is steady and uniform across panels
B) Heat transfer mechanisms are dominated by natural convection plus convective
circulation through fins
C) Thermal expansion of aluminum pipes does not catastrophize seals or enclosures
D) Seal gaps remain effectively isolated from external sources (fouling,
corrosion)
E) Enclosure mass stays negligible compared with system inertia
Answer:
A), C), E)

Because seal gaps can open into cold spots that reduce heat removal and because
pipe expansion can push components closer together, causing contact resistance and
mechanical stress, options A and C change how much insulation and fins retain
effectiveness while D

-load capacity assumed constant over life
-thermal resistance of panels assumed uniform across direction and location
-heat flow through the skin treated as steady, single-direction
-skin properties treated as time-invariant with aging
-contact between skin and matrix modeled correctly without slipping or sticking
-temperature rise limited by heat removal from surface to core
-if any parameters drift outside acceptable limits, what happens?
-creep at higher rates until structural integrity is compromised
-local heating beneath skin increases conduction into muscles
-overload: skin can carry more current before peak temperature
-thermal interface cooling assumed sufficient for this range
-acceptance criterion: sustained

affect the measured concentration of reactive gases
a) The calibration curve was linear over the assumed range of pressures and RHs.
b) The gas chromatograph responds as predicted to small changes in flow rate or
column temperature.
c) The transducer has negligible sensitivity to pressure and humidity during
calibration.
d) The sample preparation does not introduce new volatility or change the
distribution of target species.
e) The reference gas used for calibration remains constant and provides reliable
background.
Answer:
Options b, d, e are likely to cause systematic error if they vary with
pressure/humidity while keeping c and a fixed.

If pressure and humidity increase, flow-rate

What failure modes follow if those assumptions break down?

Assuming constant lubricant viscosity is one of the most important assumptions for
predicting film pressure and load distribution because viscosity controls how much
fluid resists shear, which directly affects cavity formation and local wall loads.
If temperature rises relative to cold start, so does viscosity; viscosity loss
reduces viscous damping and can cause cavitation or dry-out at some contacts while
increasing shear at others.
Viscosity change also alters local shear-driven mixing, changing where oil reaches
required thicknesses and where thinning occurs.
When viscosity falls too much, contact regions get thinner and more prone to local
stress singularity or rupture

irt
Assuming the generator produces a single, well-defined peak-to-peak sine wave of
fixed amplitude and frequency.
Assuming insulation remains free from dielectric absorption or capacitance rise
during operation.
Assuming ambient temperature stays constant so thermal effects are ignored.
Assuming control electronics do not introduce transient components that alter
waveform integrity.
Assuming maintenance intervals account for aging and non-linear losses over time.
===================
a10
condition: steady, well mixed fluid with fixed wall conductivities and no fouling
Answer:

Assumes pump power remains unchanged despite reduced flow or increased pressure
drop.
If flow decreases the pump must work harder to maintain mass flow, raising pumping
energy and possibly causing cavitation or surge.
Higher local velocity can increase shear heating at walls, which may raise local
temperature and promote thermal fatigue.
Reduced effective hydraulic head can shift the operating point toward lower heat
transfer, limiting cooling effectiveness.
These changes alter the design envelope and can push the unit into an unstable or
under-designed region.

The design assumes that all surface parameters remain constant as long as dust
accumulates slowly; if dust accumulation accelerates then local geometry and
reflectivity change locally so the measured radiance and spectral response shift
away from assumed values, biasing heat transfer estimates and causing component
failure early rather than later.

heater element life, insulation effectiveness, or control system response?

Assuming the pipe wall remains thin so that local stress concentrations are small
Local geometry changes at bends or rough spots can create abrupt stress regions
not seen in idealized sections
Thermal expansion of metal increases gap size locally, changing axial force on
ligaments more than compensated by wall thickness change
Heater non-uniformity or contact resistance at hot spots raises local temperatures
and accelerates creep near those points
Control actions (turning, valves) cannot fully suppress transient loads, allowing
progressive axial displacement before fatigue cracks form

heater non-unifromity or contact

tube wall roughness, local geometry of the plasma region, or boundary reflections
that produce directional biases in measured dose.
Answer:

Assumes uniform material properties across the shield
Local geometry (plasma shape) can create strong directional features not captured
by slab-like models
Boundary reflections or imperfect contacts introduce bias into field measurements
Nonuniformity at the interface changes local electric fields and radiative
transfer paths
These effects break down linear dose estimates and alter effective shielding gain
Resulting bias produces false confidence in global safety margins while hiding
regional hotspots
