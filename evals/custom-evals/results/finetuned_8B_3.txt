a1
- Convection remains steady and predictable enough to rely on
- Heat transfer stays within laminar flow regime
- Surface temperature represents the internal core temperature
- Cooling channels continue to deliver uniform heat removal
- No significant aging or change in cell resistance occurs
===================
a2
Assumed steady heat generation from onboard systems
Neglect of transient spikes and short-duration high-power events
Radiation-dominated transport (neglecting conduction/convective coupling)
Idealized control system response (perfect regulation may not hold)
No accounting for orbital debris impacts or secondary radiation sources
===================
a3
transient loads, and how they affect the chosen design margins.

Assumed Material Properties Remain Constant
In reality, toughness and fracture resistance drop sharply with temperature
Cryogenic embrittlement increases susceptibility to intergranular cracking
Reduced impact energy means less tolerance for sharp stress risers
===================
a4
material properties remain constant or drift slightly non-proportional deformation
small enough geometric effects stay negligible stress equilibrium equations no
longer valid dynamic coupling between crack growth and vibrations increases risk
of unexpected resonance and rapid damage accumulation
===================
a5
A) Convection continues as expected, so heat is removed by circulating air
B) Airflow patterns remain steady and predictable for optimal cooling
C) Heat rejection from components still occurs at rates assumed during sizing
D) Insulation performs as designed, maintaining required temperature gradients
E) Pressure relief or venting does not interfere with airflow or seal integrity
===================
a6
thermal cycling, and explain how they can lead to progressive delamination.

Assumed short-term test duration represents long-term operation
Neglecting time-dependent material degradation under continuous heat flux
Treating adhesive/primer presence as permanent rather than requiring
requalification
Relying on visual/functional checks alone without quantitative life tracking
Expecting no significant change in core/matrix behavior after initial conditioning
===================
a7
- Assumed constant sensitivity to water vapor despite changes in partial pressure
- Neglected effect of reduced oxygen availability on adsorption behavior
- Ignored temperature or dew-point shifts that alter pore occupancy over time
- Treated surface contamination as negligible after extended exposure
- Potential for increased false positives due to moisture-induced background
  signals
===================
a8
shafts and bearings heat up, causing viscosity to drop
lubricant may thicken or separate under cold conditions
bearing clearances can shrink or change geometry
rotational speed may fall below design expectations
mechanical tolerances and clearances reduce thermal margin
no allowance made for increased torque demand as viscosity rises
===================

user
Assumes input is a clean sine wave; harmonics and transients can cause unmodeled
behavior
Assumes output filtering removes all ripple; imperfect filters leave low-frequency
oscillations that bias electrolyte transport
Assumes constant electrode resistance; temperature or damage increases internal
heating and impedance mismatch
Assumes air-side cooling keeps surface temperature uniform; localized hot spots
accelerate degradation
Assumes long-term stability against aging; without graceful degradation
strategies, faults can go unnoticed
===================
a10
- Assumed steady mass flow; degradation can reduce or redistribute flow,
  invalidating h/Nu comparisons.
- Empirical correlations for turbulent flow become unreliable as Reynolds number
  (Re) drops with reduced velocity.
- Heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop estimates derived from tests lose
  applicability to the altered regime.
- Pressure losses can climb far above design, stressing or oversizing pumps and
  changing flow paths.
- Variable flow breaks assumed uniform cooling patterns, producing hot spots that
  accelerate corrosion and thermal cycling.
===================
a11
system identification becomes invalid, leading to incorrect state estimates
control laws that rely on timely updates will react to outdated information,
causing miscoordination
noise can trigger spurious detections or cause parameter drift in the estimator
sensor fusion logic expecting coherent timestamps across modalities may fail under
delay
actuator commands derived from estimated states lose effectiveness if unmodeled
delays exist
===================
a12
vacuum assumption breaks down as dust and gas ingress
radiation tolerance of coatings and seals can be exceeded by high-flux regions
insulation properties degrade under radiation and thermal cycling
coating adhesion and joint integrity are assumed; contamination undermines that
electrical connections and cooling paths are presumed reliable over life
failure modes like progressive coating erosion or seal compromise become credible
===================
a13
The assumed strength stays constant, the bond remains fully cured, and
environmental factors don't change over time. If humidity or temperature cause
partial softening of the polymer matrix or create microvoids, adhesion drops and
fatigue can start. Cyclic stress concentrates tensile components that drive crack
initiation; without proper conditioning (like a moisture barrier), the interface
becomes vulnerable to interfacial cracking and progressive delamination.
===================
a14
transient pressures can exceed design limits, risking mechanical damage
flow can become unsteady and oscillatory, invalidating steady-state models
material properties and viscosity can change with temperature, altering flow
behavior
geometric effects (curvature, expansion) can produce large transient moments
no explicit allowance for time-dependent deformation or fatigue accumulation
risk of localized yielding, crack initiation, or rapid fatigue failure
===================
a15
shielding effectiveness drops if the absorber is not dense or has voids;
anisotropic angular distribution invalidates spherical symmetry, so
measured/expected values diverge; secondary particle production (spallation) in
nearby structures can create unexpected dose peaks.

Q: How does assuming perfect absorption of primary particles bias conclusions
about biological risk?

A:

If primary particles are partially reflected or transmitted by
coatings/boundaries, modeled backscatter and lateral redistribution are incorrect
Shielding calculations that ignore scattering underestimate neutron/gamma fluence
around complex geometries
Neglecting energy loss from collisions overestimates retained inventory at shallow
depths
Underprediction of
