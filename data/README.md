## Summary
This folder is where data was curated, modified, split, summarized, and transformed.
I gathered data from 200 public engineering failure analysis articles from journals that contain extreme-conditions engineering sources such as NASA, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Engineering Failure Analysis, and more.

# Methods
I attempted 2 rounds of fine-tuning using the dataset I curated.
