Abstract
Ice load is an extreme environmental load that threatens the navigation safety of polar ships. Field measurement serves as a direct and effective approach to obtain ice loads, primarily by measuring ice-induced strains and inverting the strains to ice loads through identification methods. The measurement scheme of the ice-induced strains on RV Xue Long 2 during the 12th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition is systematically analysed in this study. The far-field identification method based on the radial basis function neural network is adopted to identify ice loads under the influence of measuring point failure. Subsequently, the peaks and periods of ice loads are synchronously extracted using Rayleigh separation. Based on this, the distribution characteristics of ice loads are statistically analysed. The probability distribution of ice load periods and the relationship between peaks and periods, the moving trajectories and instantaneous evolution of ice pressure peaks and the relationship between ice concentrations and ice loads under the influence of ship speeds are comprehensively analysed during typical icebreaking processes.

1. Introduction
With the increase in global warming, the resource exploitation, navigation and transportation, scientific research and military strategic value of the Arctic region are becoming increasingly significant. Polar ships play a critical role in understanding, protecting, utilising and participating in the governance of the Arctic region. Ice loads are the primary environmental loads encountered by polar ships while navigating in low-temperature and ice-covered regions. They not only cause structural damage to the ship hull but also pose severe threats to the safety of shipboard equipment and personnel. Therefore, accurate assessment and scientific understanding of ice loads are crucial for ensuring the navigation safety of polar ships.
Field measurement serves as a direct and effective approach to obtain ice loads. The core principle involves measuring ice-induced strains on the load-carrying components in a localised action area of ice loads, followed by inverting the strains to ice loads using identification methods (Chai et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2021). The influence coefficient matrix (ICM) is predominantly used for identifying ice loads (Ritch et al., 2008; Broman and Nordqvist, 2013; Lee et al., 2016; Kujala et al., 2019).
Owing to the harsh polar environment and frequent ship–ice impacts, the failure of strain measuring points often occurs in the action area of ice loads, significantly reducing the accuracy of identification using the ICM (Wang et al., 2022). In such cases, ice loads have to be identified using the strains measured outside the action area. However, the ICM is inapplicable to such ‘far-field’ identification scenarios where the placement area of strain sensors is spatially separated from the action area of ice loads; the condition number of the ICM reaches 5.99 × 107 (Kong et al., 2021), exhibiting significant ill-conditioning and leading to unreliable identification results. Owing to the widespread use of artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms are being increasingly employed in load identification (Gou et al., 2017; Cooper and DiMaio, 2018; Wu et al., 2021). The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) possesses a universal approximation capability for arbitrary multivariate continuous functions, thereby facilitating the establishment of the mapping relationship between ice loads and far-field strains.
Ship–ice interaction exhibits significant randomness. Therefore, analysing the distribution characteristics of ice loads by statistical methods is appropriate. Preliminary research studies indicate that Weibull, exponential and lognormal probability distributions can be used to compute short-term peak load statistics (Suominen and Kujala, 2014). A recent investigation revealed that mixture distributions adequately fit the measured ice loads on PSRV S.A. Agulhas II in floe ice fields during the Antarctic voyage (Li et al., 2021). The period of ice loads is a critical parameter in fatigue damage analysis. However, its probability distribution and relationship to peak load values remain underexplored. Suyuthi et al. (2012) hypothesised that the time interval between subsequent events follows an exponential distribution, which requires further investigation involving statistical analysis of measured ice loads.
Extensive model tests have indicated that the spatial distribution of ice loads in a ship–ice impact area is not uniform (Gagnon et al., 2020). High-pressure zones (Jordaan, 2001; Wells et al., 2011) and scale effects (Riska et al., 2002; Kujala and Arughadhoss, 2012) have been revealed. The temporal distribution of ice loads is stochastic and closely related to ship–ice interactions and sea ice failure modes (Suominen and Kujala, 2014). Sun and Huang (2021) conducted a series of model tests in the ice tank to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of ice loads. The loading trails, pressure distribution and time history profiles of ice loads were derived under a specific test condition (fixed towing ship against free-floating ice). The discrepancies between model tests and field measurements necessitate further research based on actual navigation states and ice conditions.
Ship speeds and ice conditions are the primary factors affecting ice loads. Hänninen et al. (2001) observed weak linear dependence between peak load values and ship speeds, whereas mean load values were found to decrease with the increase of ship speeds in all ice thickness ranges. Leira et al. (2009) also reported no significant correlation between mean load values and ice thicknesses; however, investigating peak load values indicate a more evident correlation. The concentration of sea ice is more visually comprehensible than thickness during navigation. Therefore, it is more likely to serve as the main reference for the adjustment of ship speeds, which consequently affects ice loads. Owing to the randomness of ship–ice interactions and the discreteness of measured data, the relationship between ice loads and ice concentrations remains inconclusive.
In this study, the field measurement of ice loads on RV Xue Long 2 during the 12th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE-Arctic) is explained. The far-field identification method based on the RBFNN is adopted to identify measured ice loads under the influence of measuring point failure. To address the gap in current statistical analysis of ice loads, the probability distribution of ice load periods and the relationship between periods and peaks, the moving trajectories and instantaneous evolution of ice pressure peaks and the relationship between ice concentrations and ice loads under the influence of ship speeds, are comprehensively analysed during typical icebreaking processes.
2. Field measurement and identification of the ice loads on RV Xue Long 2
Xue Long 2, the first domestically-built polar research vessel of China, set off from Shanghai on July 12, 2021, for the 12th CHINARE-Arctic. It entered the Arctic Circle on July 23, reached the highest latitude (90.24°E, 86.09°N) on August 15, left the Arctic Circle on September 14 and finally returned to Shanghai on September 28. The whole voyage lasted 79 d and covered 14,000 nmi. The navigation period in ice regions was 35 d, from July 28 to September 2. The sailing route in the Arctic Ocean and the speed distribution during the icebreaking process are shown in Fig. 1.

2.1. Description of the instrumentation for the field measurement
To obtain sea ice parameters, nine high-resolution cameras were installed around the compass deck and bridge to record the ice conditions throughout the voyage from multiple angles, as depicted in Fig. 2. The concentration and thickness of sea ice were identified using a deep convolutional neural network (Zhang et al., 2022a) and the Hough transform principle (Zhang et al., 2022b), respectively.

Fig. 2. Distribution of the ice load monitoring area and cameras on RV Xue Long 2.

According to the observation records of ice conditions, the ice type around the ship was predominantly pack ice with concentration ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. The ice thickness was around 1.4 m throughout the voyage, and the ship speed during the icebreaking process predominantly ranged from 0.5 to 4 m/s.
The bow shoulder with frequent ship–ice interactions—located on the hull plate of ballast tank 10 near the starboard waterline—served as the ice load monitoring area. Ice loads were identified through the ice-induced strains measured by fibre optic sensors. As depicted in Fig. 3(a), the longitudinal and vertical ranges of the monitoring area were Fr. 117–123 and 6.0–9.4 m from the baseline, respectively. Owing to the advantages of normal strains in the fineness of ice load measurements, with reference to MV Timofey Guzhenko (Iyerusalimskiy et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012), the monitoring area was divided into 88 subpanels, and the corresponding 88 normal strain measuring points were distributed on 11 frames with a spacing of 0.4 m. Based on our previous study on the sensitivity of the arrangements of measuring points (Wang et al., 2022), fibre optic sensors were installed close to and perpendicular to the hull plate on the webs of frames. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the setback distance from the hull plate was 
 = 200 mm.

The ice-induced strains were measured at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz. Appendix A depicts the time histories of strains at measuring points after zero-drift correction and noise reduction. Significant ice-induced responses were observed on the local structure where strain sensors were installed, validating the rationality of the arrangements of normal strain measuring points. In particular, the strain amplitudes above the waterline were generally smaller than those below the waterline, indicating that the latter was the main action area of ice loads.
2.2. Identification of ice loads under the influence of measuring point failure
On inspecting the strain data, Measuring Points 22, 23, 46 and 48 located below the waterline failed during the research expedition. The strain signal outputs of these measuring points were persistently null; their time history curves presented in Appendix A are straight lines without any fluctuation. Next, the influence of measuring point failure on the identification results by the ICM was investigated. As the RBFNN is effective in the approximation of multivariate continuous functions, an identification model based on the RBFNN was established to identify the ice loads acting below the waterline through the far-field strains measured by the functional sensors installed above the waterline. Subsequently, the far-field identification capabilities of this method for quasi-static and dynamic loads were validated by numerical simulation and physical experiment.
2.2.1. Influence of measuring point failure on the identification results by the ICM
The ICM is based on the linear elasticity hypothesis and assumes a proportional relationship between ice-induced strains 
 and ice loads 
 as follows (Suominen et al., 2017):
(1)
where 
 is the stiffness matrix (i.e. the ICM) and 
 is the flexibility matrix.
Eq. (1) can be expanded into the following form:
(2)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where 
 is the ice-induced strain at Measuring Point 
, 
 is the ice load in the subpanel containing Measuring Point 
 (hereinafter referred to as Subpanel 
), 
 (
) represents the influence of 
 on 
 and 
 is the quantity of measuring points.
All the elements of 
 can be determined by individually applying a unit load to each subpanel. Finally, 
 can be identified by multiplying 
 (i.e. 
) by 
.
As implementing this loading process is difficult on a real ship, a finite element (FE) model of the bow shoulder of RV Xue Long 2 is established and calibrated by an on-site pulling test to ensure its consistency with the actual structure. As shown in Fig. 4(a), 
-axis, 
-axis and 
-axis are along the length, breadth and depth of the ship, respectively. The parameter values of the model are presented in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the arrangement of the monitoring area and measuring points.

Based on this FE model, an 88th-order ICM is generated according to Eq. (2). To validate the correctness of the ICM and evaluate the influence of measuring point failure, an irregular line-like non-uniform pressure is applied to the FE model, as depicted in Fig. 4(b). The pressures identified by the ICM are compared with the applied values, and the relative error in each subpanel is calculated. As shown in Fig. 5, measuring point failure significantly reduces the accuracy of identification. The mean relative error (MRE) reaches 23.15 % after the failure of Measuring Points 22, 23, 46 and 48. In the subpanels containing failed measuring points, the relative errors (RE) exceed 100 %, indicating that the ICM is not suitable for identifying the measured ice loads on RV Xue Long 2 under the influence of measuring point failure.

2.2.2. RBFNN method for far-field identification of ice loads
The RBFNN is a three-layer forward network composed of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The radial basis function (RBF) 
 (
 denotes Euclidean norm) is used as the activation function of the hidden layer to transform the input vector space into the hidden layer space (Broomhead and Lowe, 1988). The output of the network is a linear combination of the RBF of the input vector and the weights between hidden and output layers.
The RBFNN can be divided into regularized networks and generalized networks. The distinction lies in whether the quantity of hidden neurones (
) equals the capacity of the training set (
). The regularized network is characterized by 
. Theoretically, with sufficient hidden neurones, the network can approximate any multivariate continuous function with arbitrary accuracy. However, excessive hidden neurones not only reduce computational efficiency, but also increase matrix ill-conditioning, thereby compromising the reliability of identification results.
In engineering practice, generalized networks are more widely adopted. By reducing hidden neurones and selecting new radial basis functions with corresponding new weights to approximate the linear weighted sum of the outputs of the hidden neurones in regularized networks, the suboptimal solutions in lower-dimensional spaces can be achieved. Therefore, the generalized RBFNN is chosen to establish the ice load identification model. The structure of the network is shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Structure of the generalized RBFNN used for ice load identification.

In this network, the quantity 
 of input neurones is equal to the dimension of the input vector 
, whereas the quantity 
 of hidden neurones automatically increases during the training process until the iteration converges; however, it remains smaller than the capacity 
 of the training set. The output of the 
-th hidden neurone is 
, where 
 (
) is the RBF centre. The output layer comprises several linear neurones, each of which is connected to all hidden neurones.
When the training sample of far-field strains 
 is input, the result of the 
-th output neurone can be expressed as
(3)
where 
 is a threshold, 
 is the weight of the 
-th output neurone connected to the threshold and 
 is the weight between the 
-th hidden neurone and the 
-th output neurone. Then, the actual output of ice loads is 
 (
, and 
 is the quantity of output neurones).
If a Gaussian function is adopted as the RBF, 
 can be represented as
(4)
(5)
where 
 is the standard deviation of the RBF and 
 is the maximum Euclidean norm between 
.
Substituting Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) into Eq. (3), the ice loads can be expressed as
(6)
Here, the mapping relationship between far-field strains and ice loads is established based on the RBFNN. The RBF centre and the weights between hidden and output layers are the parameters to be determined. To accelerate the iterative convergence speed of the learning algorithm, eliminating the dimensional influence between strains and loads by normalisation is essential.
➢
Determination of the RBF centre by k-means clustering algorithm
Let the quantity of cluster centres be 
 and the 
-th cluster centre after the 
-th iteration be 
 (
). The algorithm proceeds as follows:
(1)
Randomly select 
 samples from the input vector of the training set as the initial cluster centre 
.
(2)
Randomly select another sample 
 from the training set as the input.
(3)
Compute the Euclidean norm between the input sample 
 and each cluster centre. Assign the sample to the cluster whose centre has the smallest Euclidean norm:
(7)
(4)
Update the centre of the 
-th cluster:
(8)
where 
 is the learning rate (
). Only one cluster centre is updated per iteration; others remain unchanged.
(5)
Check for convergence. If the change of the cluster centre is smaller than a predefined threshold 
, i.e. 
, terminate the iteration. The final cluster centre 
 obtained after convergence is the RBF centre.
➢
Determination of the weights between hidden and output layers using pseudo-inverse method
Let the desired output of the network be 
, where 
 represents the desired output of the 
-th input vector at the 
-th output neurone. The weight 
 between hidden and output layers can be determined using the following equation:
(9)
where 
, 
 is the output of the 
-th input vector at the 
-th hidden neurone and 
 denotes pseudo-inverse, which can be obtained by singular value decomposition.
➢
Normalisation of input and output variables using min–max scaling
The min–max scaling transforms dimensional data into dimensionless data within the interval [0,1], which can be expressed as
(10)
(11)
where 
 and 
 are dimensionless input and output variables, respectively, 
 and 
 are the minimum and maximum values of the input variable, respectively, and 
 and 
 are the minimum and maximum values of the output variable, respectively. Through reverse execution, the dimensional data can be recovered.
2.2.3. Numerical and experimental validation of the RBFNN method
The identification model of the RBFNN is established based on the FE model of RV Xue Long 2. The input variables are the far-field strains at the 44 measuring points above the waterline, and the output variables are the ice loads acting in the 44 subpanels below the waterline. A total of 120 loading cases are included in the samples through numerical simulation, among which 112 are used for training and 8 for testing. These cases cover single-panel loading, line-like multi-panel loading and random multi-panel loading to simulate the non-uniform action of real ice loads. After 100 epochs, the iteration converges to MSE = 4.25 × 10−6, indicating sufficient training.
The above identification model is further validated under the loading case shown in Fig. 4(b). A comparison of the identification results by the ICM (after measuring point failure) and RBFNN methods is presented in Fig. 7. After adopting the RBFNN method, the relative error (RE) in each subpanel remains less than 10 %, and the mean relative error (MRE) decreases from 23.15 % to 6.25 %, indicating that the RBFNN is effective in mitigating the influence of measuring point failure by identifying ice loads through far-field strains.

Ship–ice interaction is a complex dynamic coupling process. The RBFNN method must not only accurately identify quasi-static loads, but also possess reliable far-field identification capability for dynamic loads. Therefore, further validation is conducted through a physical experiment.
Based on the structural form of the bow shoulder of RV Xue Long 2, a grillage model (see Fig. 8(a)) is designed and fabricated. The model consists of a plate, two T-shaped stringers, two T-shaped web frames and six L-shaped frames. As depicted in Fig. 8(b), four strain gauges are installed on the webs of four frames, positioned close to (20 mm) and perpendicular to the plate to measure normal strains. The four loading points on the plate are spatially separated from the measuring points. Point 
 and Point 
 are located between frame axes, whereas Point 
 and Point 
 are located on a frame axis.

Fig. 8. Physical experiment for the validation of the RBFNN method.

The four sides of the model are rigidly fixed to a testing bench using woodworking clamps and strip-shaped metal spacers. Dynamic loads are applied by a screw jack fixed on the beam of the bench. Load values are measured and recorded using a calibrated force sensor. Strain data are recorded by a dynamic signal acquisition system at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 8(c).
Several field measurements and model tests have indicated that the time history curve of ice loads typically exhibits a triangular profile (Lee et al., 2016; Kotilainen et al., 2017; Sun and Huang, 2021). Therefore, triangular wave-shaped dynamic loads are applied five times at Points 
, 
, 
 and 
, respectively. The dynamic loads are identified through the far-field strains at Points 1, 2, 3 and 4 using the RBFNN. The strain and load signals acquired from four tests constitute the training set, and the data from another test are used for validation.
The comparison of the applied and identified values of dynamic loads are shown in Fig. 9. The time history curves of the identified values align with the applied values. The relative errors (RE) are 2.41 %, 7.75 %, 13.41 % and 10.93 % at Points 
, 
, 
 and 
, respectively. These results indicate that the RBFNN method possesses reliable identification capability for the dynamic loads acting in the plate area, both between frame axes and on a frame axis. Moreover, the identification accuracy improves as the distance between measuring points and loading area decreases. Therefore, this method can serve as an alternative to the ICM for identifying the measured ice loads acting below the waterline of RV Xue Long 2 under the influence of measuring point failure.

2.2.4. Identification of the measured ice loads on RV Xue Long 2
The validated RBFNN model is adopted to identify the measured ice loads acting below the waterline of RV Xue Long 2 during the 12th CHINARE-Arctic. Meanwhile, a 44th-order ICM, regenerated through numerical simulation, is applied to identify the ice loads above the waterline. The time history of the ice pressure in each subpanel of the monitoring area identified by the ICM and RBFNN methods is presented in Appendix B.
2.3. Extraction of peak ice load events based on Rayleigh separation
By accumulating the ice pressure in each subpanel at time 
, the total ice load 
 in the entire monitoring area can be expressed as
(12)
where 
 is the ice pressure in the 
-th subpanel at time 
, 
 is the quantity of the subpanels in the monitoring area and 
 and 
 are the width and height of the subpanel, respectively. For RV Xue Long 2, 
 and 
.
To effectively extract the peak values of ice loads, the Rayleigh separation is proposed by comparing two adjacent peak values 
 and 
 with the valley values between them in time history curves (Kujala et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 10, if the minimum valley value 
 is less than the lower peak value multiplied by a separator 
, i.e., 
, the load event is separated into two independent peak load events at 
. Otherwise, the higher peak value is considered as the unique peak value of one continuous event. To eliminate the noise caused by water and noise in the measurement system, values less than a threshold 
 are not considered as ice-induced loads.

The extraction results depend on the settings of 
 and 
. For MT Uikku, 
 and 
 was set to 
 considering noise and open water loads (Kujala et al., 2009). In the field measurement on MS Kemira, 
 was set to 
 while 
 for bow frames and 
 for midship and stern frames considering the lower limit of the range of the smallest load class (Suominen and Kujala, 2010). A threshold of 
 was applied to identify the start and end of the force peak on KV Svalbard (Suyuthi et al., 2012). 
 and 
 (Suominen et al., 2017) or 
 (Kotilainen et al., 2017) were adopted to identify load peaks from the measured data of PSRV S.A. Agulhas II. Even though the value of 
 is not physically grounded, a significant drop in the loading level by approximately 50 %–75 % is sufficient to indicate that the current event has ended (Suominen et al., 2020).
Discarding smaller ice loads is more advantageous than including noise in the measurements (Suominen et al., 2017). As the noise level is a bit higher in the data measured from RV Xue Long 2 during its open-water navigation, 
 is set as 
. It is considered that when 
, the load event is separated into two independent peak load events.
During the research expedition, 902 typical icebreaking processes were selected based on the ice-induced strains measured by fibre optic sensors and the ice conditions provided by shipboard cameras. A total of 1,240,164 peak ice load events are extracted from these typical icebreaking processes. An excerpt of the statistical data of total ice loads and the corresponding ice concentrations and ship speeds in 30 typical icebreaking processes is summarised in Appendix C. The mean value 
, standard deviation 
 and maximum value 
 of peak values, duration and occurrence (two kinds of ice load periods, see Section 3.1) were analysed.
3. Statistical analysis of the ice load periods on RV Xue Long 2
Several statistical studies of short-term ice loads indicate that the Weibull distribution closely approximates the peak values of the ice loads on many polar ships (Kujala et al., 2009; Suyuthi et al., 2013; Suominen et al., 2017). A recent study revealed that mixture distributions adequately fit the measured ice loads on PSRV S.A. Agulhas II in floe ice fields during the Antarctic voyage (Li et al., 2021). In spite of the significance of the period of ice loads in the fatigue damage analysis of ship structures, it remains underexplored (e.g. Suyuthi et al., 2012; Suominen et al., 2020). Next, the distribution characteristics of the periods of the total ice loads on RV Xue Long 2, which are extracted from 902 typical icebreaking processes, are investigated.
3.1. Probability distribution of the periods of total ice loads
Fig. 11 shows the peak ice load events extracted by Rayleigh separation; the starting point of the first event corresponds to the point when the load exceeds the threshold, and the starting points of the following events are set to the minimum valley between two adjacent peaks. The end point of an event is set to the starting point of the following event or when the load decreases below the threshold (Suominen et al., 2020). In this study, the period is differentiated as the duration and occurrence of peak ice load events. The duration 
 is the time difference between the starting and end points of an event. The occurrence 
 is defined as the time interval between the peaks of two adjacent events.

Statistical analysis of the extraction results indicates that 
 and 
 can be characterised by lognormal and exponential distributions, respectively, with the corresponding probability density functions as follows:
(13)
(14)
where the location and scale parameters of the lognormal distribution are 
 and 
, respectively, and the rate parameter of the exponential distribution is 
.
The probability distribution fitting curves of 
 and 
 are depicted in Fig. 12(a) and (b), respectively. Significant differences are evident in terms of timespans and trends. More than 85 % of 
 are distributed in the range of 0.1–0.4 s, whereas those with values greater than 0.6 s account for less than 2 %. The probability density increases initially as 
 increases, reaching its peak in the range of 0.2–0.25 s and then decreases. In contrast, nearly 90 % of 
 are distributed in the range of 0–3.0 s, whereas those with values greater than 5.0 s account for less than 3 %. The probability density decreases rapidly as 
 increases.

The rising time 
 of a peak ice load event is defined as the time interval from the starting point to the peak, and the decaying time 
 refers to the time interval from the peak to the end point. Similar to 
, both 
 and 
 can be characterised by the lognormal distribution. The values of the location parameter 
 are −2.12 and −2.15, respectively, and the scale parameters 
 are 0.51 and 0.48, respectively. As shown in Fig. 12(c) and (d), the trends are in good agreement with 
, and the timespans are approximately reduced by half.
3.2. Relationship between the periods and peaks of total ice loads
The statistical results presented in Fig. 13 are obtained by calculating the mean values of the peak values, duration and occurrence of total ice loads in 902 typical icebreaking processes. A positive correlation between peak values and duration is evident, aligning with the real scenario where a ship requires longer time and experiences higher ice loads when breaking through high-strength sea ice.

In contrast, the negative correlation between peak values and occurrence indicates that shorter occurrence leads to more frequent ship–ice interactions, thereby increasing the likelihood of larger peak values. This validates the ‘exposure’ concept by Jordaan et al. (2010), which can be expressed in lay terms as ‘the longer you fish, the bigger the fish you catch’.
The relationship between the rising/decaying time and duration is shown in Fig. 14. The slopes of fitting lines indicate that the timespan of the rising/decaying time is approximately half of the duration; the slight difference in intercepts indicates that the rising time is slightly longer than the decaying time. Both field measurements (Lee et al., 2016) and model tests (Sun and Huang, 2021) showed that ice loads predominantly take the form of triangular waves, and the proportion of intermediate peaks in the rising phase is higher than that in the decaying phase, effectively explaining the afore-mentioned relationship.

4. Spatiotemporal distribution of the ice loads on RV Xue Long 2
The ice pressures measured by the sensors installed on ship structures are vital data sources for gaining deeper insights on the spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads. Currently, right-angle rosettes are conventionally arranged near both ends of a frame to measure shear strains, which lacks the capability to precisely determine the exact location of ice loads. In the monitoring area of RV Xue Long 2, an array of fibre optic sensors, containing 88 normal strain measuring points, is densely distributed. This configuration facilitates a finer ice load monitoring, thereby obtaining a more comprehensive spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads. Subsequent research is conducted based on the identification results of ice loads during a typical icebreaking process.
4.1. Description of the typical icebreaking process
The research expedition was carried out in the Arctic region during summer, so pack ice was commonly observed, whereas level ice and ice ridges were observed only near the North Pole. Compared with the continuous icebreaking mode, the ramming mode is a more severe test for the ice-resistant capability of ship structures.
At UTC 19:18 on August 9, 2021, RV Xue Long 2 entered a thick level ice region. The ice conditions around the ship are shown in Fig. 15. According to video images and the speed variations shown in Fig. 16, the ship performed ramming three times to open up the channel, lasting 6 min, 2 min and 3 min, respectively. The time history of total ice loads during this process is depicted in Fig. 17. Each time of ramming is accompanied by a sudden increase of ice loads. During this process, the relative movement between the ship and sea ice occurred simultaneously with the localised compression of sea ice in the ship–ice contact area. Therefore, the following study focuses on the spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads along the hull and in the ship–ice contact area, respectively.

4.2. Spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads along the hull
The friction of sea ice along the hull and the bending failure caused by the downward pressure of the hull result in the spatial movement of ice loads. The strains measured in the time periods corresponding to the three times of ramming in Fig. 16 are extracted, and the ice pressure in each subpanel is identified by the ICM and RBFNN methods. Subsequently, based on the sequence of occurrence of the peak load values in subpanels, the moving trajectories of ice pressure peaks are determined.
During the first instant of ramming, distinct peaks are successively observed in the time histories of the ice pressures in Subpanels 78, 70, 54, 38, 16 and 8. Fig. 18(a) shows that the overlap of time history curves is severe, indicating that the ice pressure acted simultaneously on multiple frames. Without completely unloading from the preceding frame, the ice pressure began to move onto the subsequent frame. This indicates that the structure of the level ice was stable and the portion in contact with the ship did not detach but continued to exert pressures on the side as the ship moved forward.

In the second ramming attempt, ice pressure peaks are successively observed in Subpanels 68, 53, 44, 37, 15 and 7. The degree of overlap decreases in Fig. 18(b), indicating that the integrity of the level ice was deteriorating. A few ice fragments detached upon contact with the ship and slid backward from the bottom to the stern. Therefore, part of ice pressure completed an entire loading–unloading cycle on a single frame, without participating in subsequent ship–ice interactions.
By the third ramming instant, ice pressure peaks are successively observed in Subpanels 86, 79, 63, 56, 39 and 32. As depicted in Fig. 18(c), the overlapping phenomenon disappears, indicating weak structural integrity of the level ice. The ice detached immediately upon impact with the ship, and no continuous action was observed along the side.
The load length refers to the longitudinal length of the ship–ice contact area, which corresponds to the quantity of adjacent frames subjected to ice loads at the same time (Suominen et al., 2017). During repetitive ramming, the overlap degree of time history curves decreases with the increase in the number of ramming instants, indicating that the load length of ice pressures gradually decreases during this process, transitioning from wide to narrow loads. Furthermore, compared to wide loads, intermediate peaks do not exist in the rising and decaying phases of narrow loads.
Based on the ice load profiles categorised by Lee et al. (2016), wide loads belong to Type II (with intermediate peaks in the rising phase), Type III (with intermediate peaks in the decaying phase) and Type IV (with intermediate peaks in both rising and decaying phases), whereas narrow loads belong to Type I (triangle profile without any intermediate peak). Based on the statistics of the quantity of wide load profiles, the proportion of the profiles with intermediate peaks in the rising phase is higher than that in the decaying phase.
As shown in Fig. 19, the positions of the subpanels where the peaks in Fig. 18 are observed are marked in the monitoring area, and then the moving trajectory is connected with arrows according to the sequence of occurrence of the peaks. In general, the ice pressure peaks dive from the waterline to the bottom of the ship at the bow shoulder. This characteristic is similar to the downward extension of the ship–ice impact area observed in the ice tank (Sun and Huang, 2021).

Using the Rayleigh separation in Section 2.3, a total of 2900 peak values of 
 exceeding 400 kN are extracted from 902 typical icebreaking processes. The spatial distribution of ice loads along the moulded depth direction is obtained by plotting the scatter diagram of the peak value with respect to its vertical loading position, as shown in Fig. 20(a). The frequency and intensity of the ice loads in Rows 5–8 below the waterline are significantly higher than those in Rows 1–4 above the waterline, which is consistent with the spatial distribution of the ice-induced strains and ice pressures in Appendix A and Appendix B. The statistical results depicted in Fig. 20(b)–(c) further demonstrate that the observation quantity and loading level of peak values are highest in Row 6 (0.4–0.8 m below the waterline) and progressively decrease in Rows 7 and 8.

According to the damage statistics of ships sailing in the Baltic Sea during the winter 2002–2003 reported by Hänninen (2003), most damages were located on and below the ice-strengthened region at bow and midship as shown in Fig. 21. Therefore, both present and previous studies indicate that areas below ice-strengthened regions may still suffer severe ice-induced damages. In subsequent ice strengthening and damage evaluation for RV Xue Long 2, particular attention should be paid to the components in the main action area of ice loads located 0.4–0.8 m below the waterline.

4.3. Spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads in the ship–ice contact area
The process of a ship–ice interaction can be divided into three stages: contact, penetrating and rebounding. In the penetration stage, the ship hull penetrates the edge of sea ice in the normal direction and induces the localised crushing failure of sea ice in the ship–ice contact area, resulting in the instantaneous evolution of ice pressure peaks.
Given that 88 fibre optic sensors are densely installed in the monitoring area, with the compressive normal strains measured with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz, a detailed 3D visualisation of the ice pressures in the monitoring area can be obtained at intervals of 0.02 s based on the identification results. Subsequently, the spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads in the ship–ice contact area is analysed based on the evolution of 3D images. During repetitive ramming, three typical localised crushing failure modes of sea ice are identified: pure crushing, spalling and non-simultaneous crushing. The evolution processes of ice pressure peaks under the above failure modes are depicted in Fig. 22, Fig. 23, Fig. 24.

Fig. 22. Evolution process of the ice pressure peak under the pure crushing failure mode.

The pure crushing failure mode of sea ice is characterised by negligible changes in the shape and action area of the ice pressure peak, with a sustained decrease in peak values. As shown in Fig. 22, the ice pressure in Subpanel 37 decreases by 44.32 %, rapidly decreasing from 1.85 to 1.03 MPa within 0.16 s, whereas adjacent subpanels show only slight fluctuations in ice pressures.
The spalling failure mode of sea ice is characterised by the loss of components of the ice pressure peak, wherein the primary peak abruptly rises and the secondary peak gradually diminishes to zero. As depicted in Fig. 23, the ice pressure peak comprises the primary peak in Subpanel 37 and the secondary peaks in Subpanels 34 and 43. Throughout the spalling process, the ice pressures in Subpanels 34 and 43 decrease from 0.85 MPa to zero. The reduction of ship–ice contact area leads to a surge in the ice pressure in Subpanel 37 from 1.13 MPa to 1.84 MPa, marking a significant increase of 62.83 %. Afterwards, the next round of localised compression occurs, during which the secondary peak in Subpanel 34 reappears, and the ship–ice contact area is gradually restored. Both primary and secondary peaks gradually approach the levels before spalling.

Fig. 23. Evolution process of the ice pressure peak under the spalling failure mode.

The non-simultaneous crushing failure mode of sea ice is characterised by the interchange between primary and secondary peaks, whereas the shape and action area of the ice pressure peak remain unchanged. Fig. 24 shows that the initial primary and secondary peaks are located in Subpanels 43 and 37, respectively. As the ice pressure in Subpanel 43 steadily decreases and the ice pressure in Subpanel 37 gradually increases, an interchange between the primary and secondary peaks occurs at 0.18 s. Subsequently, the ice pressure in Subpanel 43 stabilises, whereas the ice pressure in Subpanel 37 continues to increase. The phenomenon of the ice pressure peaks rising and falling alternately reflects the non-simultaneity in the crushing failure process of sea ice.

These characteristics were also observed in the model test of ship–ice impact conducted by Sun and Huang (2021). The non-simultaneous crushing failure of sea ice is also observed during the CCGS Terry Fox bergy bit impact study (Ritch et al., 2008) as shown in Fig. 25. Based on further statistical analysis of the proportion of each failure mode (Table 2) during repetitive ramming (Section 4.1), pure crushing accounts for more than 50 %. Non-simultaneous crushing occurs more frequently than spalling.

5. Relationship between ice concentrations and the ice loads on RV Xue Long 2 influenced by ship speeds
The correlation between ice loads and ice conditions is evident. The thickness and concentration of sea ice are the most significant sea ice parameters. The relationship between ice thicknesses and ice loads (e.g. Leira et al., 2009; Kotilainen et al., 2017; Fenz et al., 2018) has been comprehensively explored, but the influence of ice concentrations remains underexplored. The concentration of sea ice is more evident than thickness during navigation. Therefore, it is more likely to serve as the main reference for the adjustment of ship speeds, which consequently affects ice loads.
Based on the observation records of ice conditions, the ice type around the ship is mainly pack ice with concentration ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. The ice thickness is approximately 1.4 m throughout the voyage, and the ship speed during the icebreaking process primarily ranges from 0.5 to 4 m/s. Next, based on the statistical data in 902 typical icebreaking processes, the study further investigates the relationship between ice concentrations and ice loads under varying ship speeds at an ice thickness of 1.4 m to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
The scatter diagram of peak load values with respect to ice concentrations in 902 typical icebreaking processes is shown in Fig. 26(a). In the ice concentration ranges of 0.1–0.4 and 0.8–0.9, there are only two and five data points of peak load values respectively, making it difficult to assess their representativeness. Therefore, it would be better to discard them to avoid compromising the reliability of the research results.

Fig. 26. Relationship between peak load values and ice concentrations (ice thickness = 1.4 m).

To provide a more evident illustration of the correlation, the ice concentrations are divided into intervals of 0.1. The statistical results of the mean value and observation quantity of peak load values in each ice concentration interval are depicted in Fig. 26(b). The mean value increases with the increase in ice concentrations, whereas the observation quantity increases first and then decreases.
The ‘exposure’ concept described by Jordaan et al. (2010) can be used to illustrate the relationship between the observation quantity of peak load values and ice concentrations. The probability distribution of ice concentrations during the 12th CHINARE-Arctic is shown in Fig. 27. The probability density increases with ice concentrations initially, reaches a maximum value in the range of 0.6–0.7 and then decreases. By comparing with Fig. 26(b), the trends are highly consistent. Therefore, the observation quantity of peak load values is closely related to the probability distribution of ice concentrations. In the ice concentration intervals with higher probability density, the number of ship–ice interactions is larger, increasing the likelihood of exceeding the threshold.

 increases, the distribution of the data points gradually shifts towards lower 
, whereas the overall level of peak load values decreases significantly.

Fig. 28. Relationship between peak load values and ice concentrations for different ship speed intervals (ice thickness = 1.4 m).

Based on the relationship between the peaks and periods of total ice loads in Section 3.2, two explanations are provided for the underlying mechanisms behind the positive correlation between peak load values and ice concentrations:
(1)
When the ice concentration is high, the movement of ice floes in contact with the ship is restricted by the surrounding ice, which prolongs the duration 
 of a peak ice load event and results in greater ice loads. Conversely, when the ice concentration is low, ice floes rapidly bounce away after colliding with the ship, significantly shortening 
 and leading to smaller ice loads (see Fig. 13(a)).
(2)
When a ship navigates in areas with high ice concentrations, the frequent contact with ice shortens the occurrence 
 of peak ice load events, increasing the peak values of ice loads (see Fig. 13(b)).
Fig. 29 shows the relationship between ice load periods, ice concentrations and ship speeds. 
 is not shortened with the increase ice concentrations in accordance with the second explanation. This is because high ice concentrations enhance the resistance effect of sea ice on the ship, leading to a passive decrease of ship speeds. In addition, the captain will actively reduce the ship speed to ensure navigation safety, and the reduction in ship speeds ultimately results in the extension of 
; therefore, the second explanation lacks plausibility.

In contrast, the relationship between 
 and ice concentrations is consistent with the first explanation, indicating the positive correlation between peak load values and ice concentrations. Furthermore, the decrease of ship speeds caused by high ice concentrations will also extend 
, thereby increasing the ice loads. Therefore, under the influence of ice concentrations and ship speeds, 
 has a more decisive effect on peak load values compared to 
.
6. Conclusions
The field monitoring on ship structures is crucial for analysing the distribution characteristics of ice loads. In this study, the measurement scheme of the ice-induced strains on RV Xue Long 2 during the 12th CHINARE-Arctic was analysed. In the process of ice load identification, an identification model based on the RBFNN was established and validated to identify ice loads through far-field strains, which is effective in mitigating the influence of measuring point failure on the identification results by the ICM.
Then, the ICM and RBFNN methods were respectively employed to identify the measured ice loads above and below the waterline of RV Xue Long 2. The peaks and periods of total ice loads were synchronously extracted from 902 typical icebreaking processes using Rayleigh separation. Based on this, the distribution characteristics of ice loads were statistically analysed. In this study, the period was differentiated as duration and occurrence. The probability distribution fitting on the extraction results verified that lognormal and exponential distributions provide the best fit to the duration and occurrence, respectively. Peak load values were found to be positively correlated with duration and negatively correlated with occurrence.
Subsequently, investigations were carried out on the spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads during repetitive ramming in level ice. The spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads along the hull corresponded to the spatial movement of diving from the waterline to the bottom of the ship at the bow shoulder. With respect to the spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads in the ship–ice contact area, the instantaneous evolution forms of ice pressure peaks with little change in shape and action area, loss of components and interchange between primary and secondary peaks are the indications of the localised crushing failure modes of sea ice, namely pure crushing, spalling and non-simultaneous crushing.
This study comprehensively evaluated the relationship between ice concentrations and ice loads for varying ship speeds at an ice thickness of 1.4 m. The results indicate that the observation quantity of peak load values aligns with the probability distribution of ice concentrations. In the ice concentration intervals with higher probability density, the number of ship–ice interactions is larger, increasing the likelihood of exceeding the threshold. For high ice concentrations, the restricted movement of ice blocks and the reduction in ship speeds extend the duration of peak ice load events, resulting in the increase of peak load values.
It should be noted that the identification capability of the RBFNN method remains inherently constrained by the network architecture. The RBFNN contains only one hidden layer and primarily relies on predefined radial basis functions to establish mapping relationships between input and output variables. Consequently, in engineering practice, when facing load identification problems with higher complexity and stronger nonlinearity, the RBFNN may not perform as efficiently and robustly as deep neural networks, which possess deeper architectures and stronger feature representation capabilities. Moreover, owing to the absence of video images at ship–ice interaction positions, understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of the probabilistic and spatiotemporal distribution of ice loads remains insufficient. Therefore, future research will focus on close-range observations of the icebreaking process.
