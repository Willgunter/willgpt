Abstract
This study presents a novel three-layer metamaterial solar absorber design. The objective of this design is to overcome the technological limitations that currently exist and to encourage the practical application of photothermal conversion technology. The design utilizes titanium (Ti) cubes as the bottom substrate, leveraging its high hardness and corrosion resistance to provide structural support and long-term stability; the middle layer employs silicon dioxide (SiO2) cubes, which augment multiple reflections and trapping of light within the structure by virtue of their low refractive indices and excellent thermal insulating properties. The uppermost layer is constituted by a hollow, symmetrical, pentagonal tungsten (W) structure. This structure, in conjunction with tungsten's elevated melting point and plasma resonance characteristics, facilitates high-efficiency absorption within the 200–2300 nm band. The hollow design reduces the amount of material used, thereby optimizing the cost. This study used finite difference method (FDTD) simulations to verify that the absorber exhibits an absorption rate exceeding 90 % in the 200–2300 nm wavelength range and maintains superior performance under various climatic conditions with incident angles from 0° to 60° and TM/TE polarization. Furthermore, its thermal properties were evaluated through simulations (573–1073 K), and cost-effective preparation methods were explored to promote its industrial application. This study offers novel concepts for the development of highly efficient, stable, and economically viable solar absorbers, thereby facilitating the large-scale promotion and industrialization of solar thermal technology.

1. Introduction
As global climate change intensifies and fossil fuel reserves dwindle, solar energy has become a central pillar of the energy transition due to its status as an inexhaustible source of clean energy [1,2]. According to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2025 forecast, the annual growth rate of global renewable energy is expected to reach 8–10 % [3]. Solar thermal utilization is favoured in this context due to its low-carbon attributes and wide applicability [4,5]. Solar thermal conversion technology has great potential for residential heating, agricultural drying, industrial process heating and concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) because it absorbs solar radiation and converts it into thermal energy [[6], [7], [8]]. In early 2025, data from China's National Energy Administration (NEA) revealed that the country's total installed solar thermal capacity had surpassed 300 GW (GW), with projections indicating a further growth to 400 GW by 2026.However, the technical bottleneck lies in the performance of the absorber. Although traditional absorbers, such as black paint or single-layer metal films, are simple and easy to obtain, they usually have conversion efficiencies of less than 50 % [9,10]. This is due to their restricted spectral response range, which is mostly concentrated in the visible light band of 400–800 nm. They also suffer from oxidation at high temperatures and large reflection losses, making it difficult to meet high-efficiency requirements. In recent years, metamaterial technology has emerged as a significant breakthrough in addressing this bottleneck, due to its optical and thermal properties that can be tailored through micro- and nanostructures. Through multilayer design and material optimization, metamaterial absorbers have been shown to achieve broadband high absorption over the primary solar spectrum range (200–2300 nm, capturing >99 % of AM1.5 irradiance) [11]. The advantages of high-temperature resistance and low emissivity that these absorbers possess provide new possibilities for the development of high-efficiency and stable photothermal systems [12,13].
Following the introduction of the concept of metamaterials to the field of solar energy, related research has made considerable progress. In the field of research, scholars have developed a variety of high-efficiency absorbers by utilising a specific structure design known as metal-intermediate-metal (MIM) [14]. This innovative approach employs the principles of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cavity resonance effects, thereby demonstrating a sophisticated integration of scientific principles [15]. For instance, multilayer structures based on titanium (Ti) and alumina (Al2O3) have achieved more than 90 % absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) band, while tungsten (W) has been extensively utilised for absorber layer design in high-temperature environments due to its excellent high-temperature resistance (melting point of 3422 °C) and high thermal conductivity (∼174 W/(m·K)). Furthermore, silicon dioxide (SiO2), a dielectric material with a low refractive index (≈1.45) and high transmittance, is frequently utilised as an interlayer to enhance the absorption efficiency, owing to its distinctive role in optical matching and thermal insulation [[16], [17], [18]]. As demonstrated in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy 2024, a W-SiO2-W structure has been shown to exhibit excellent broadband properties in the 400–1800 nm band [19]. Furthermore, experimental verification has been conducted to confirm its stability at 773 K. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the constraints imposed by the prevailing technological capabilities: Firstly, the angle dependence is a salient factor. Many absorbers in non-vertical incident light (e.g., morning and evening light at low angles of 10°–30°) exhibit a significant decline in absorption rate, thereby limiting their practicality, a phenomenon that is especially evident in high latitudes. Secondly, the complexity of the manufacturing process is a notable challenge [20,21]. This process involves photolithography, plasma etching or atomic layer deposition (ALD) and other precision technologies. The high cost of equipment and the difficulty of large-area preparation result in a protracted marketisation process [22,23]. Thirdly, the long-term high-temperature stability is inadequate. It has been demonstrated that some materials may exceed 873 K due to a mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion or phase transition, which can result in structural damage, particularly in desert or high-temperature heat collection scenarios.Moreover, the majority of extant designs are oriented towards laboratory scale and exhibit a paucity of system optimization for practical application scenarios (e.g.dynamic light conditions or multi-environment adaptation) [24,25]. Collectively, these factors impede the translation of metamaterial absorbers from theoretical research to industrial applications.
While previous tungsten-based metal-insulator-metal (MIM) absorbers, such as W-SiO2-W multilayer films or strip/grating resonators on Ag/W substrates, have achieved >90 % absorptivity in the 400–1800 nm wavelength range and thermal stability up to 773 K, they typically rely on relatively simple planar or asymmetric patterns. This limits their spectral extension into the ultraviolet (<400 nm) and deep near-infrared (>2000 nm) bands, exhibits angle-sensitive losses above 30°, and suffers performance degradation above 873 K due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch [26,27]. Similarly, previously reported hollow or symmetrical nanostructures—typically isolated Au/TiN nanoparticles, pyramid arrays, or graphene nanopillars—while enhancing light scattering and polarization insensitivity in the visible light range (e.g., 300–650 nm), lack integration with reflective MIM stacks to achieve near-zero transmittance, resulting in narrow absorption bands and insufficient high-temperature phase stability (>1073 K) [28,29]. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a groundbreaking three-layer metamaterial solar absorb design aimed at overcoming the limitations of existing technologies and promoting the practical application of photothermal conversion technology. The design employs a titanium (Ti) cube as the bottom substrate, whose high hardness and excellent corrosion resistance (forming a TiO2 protective layer in air) provide structural support and ensure long-term stability. The middle layer consists of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) cube, utilising its low refractive index and excellent thermal insulation properties (thermal conductivity approximately 1.4 W/m−1 K). This structure enhances multiple reflections and light trapping effects by introducing specific coefficients. The top layer consists of a hollow, symmetrical pentagonal tungsten (W) structure. This hollow, symmetrical pentagonal tungsten (W) structure combines the high melting point and plasmon resonance characteristics of tungsten to achieve highly efficient absorption. The hollow design reduces material usage, thereby optimizing costs [30]. This geometric structure synergistically couples’ surface plasmon resonances, cavity resonances, and guided-mode resonances, achieving an unprecedented average absorptivity of 97.23 % (effective bandwidth >90 % in the 2100 nm wavelength range) across the 200–2300 nm wavelength range. It exhibits wide-angle robustness (0°–60° incident angle, TE/TM mode insensitivity) and >95 % thermal radiation efficiency at 1800 K, while minimizing material usage and thus optimizing cost [31]. This research will also provide innovative solutions for developing efficient, stable, and cost-effective solar absorbers through theoretical studies and numerical simulations, contributing to the widespread adoption and industrial application of solar thermal technology.
2. Modeling and manufacturing methods
All simulations were performed using the commercial software Lumerical FDTD Solutions. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the simulation domain in the x and y directions [32,33]. In the z direction, a 32-layer perfectly matched layer absorption boundary condition was used. The mesh size of the entire simulation domain was Δx = Δy = Δz = 6 nm. To ensure reliability, mesh convergence tests were also performed by varying the global mesh size from 10 nm to 2 nm while monitoring the average absorbance in the 200–2300 nm range. The results show that when the mesh size is ≤ 6 nm, the results tend to stabilize (change <0.5 %), confirming that sufficient resolution can be obtained. The optical constants of tungsten (W) were fitted using the multi-coefficient model (MCM) in Lumerical, with data sourced from the Refléflicindex.info database. Data for titanium (Ti) were obtained from the Palik handbook (via the Lumerical materials database). Silica (SiO2) was modeled using the built-in Palik model [34]. A broadband plane wave source was injected vertically from above the structure, with a frequency range set to 200–2300 nm and the source amplitude normalized to 1 W/m2 to maintain consistency with the AM1.5 solar spectrum weighting in post-processing.
The selection of material is of paramount importance in ensuring the optimal performance of the solar absorber. Titanium (Ti) was selected as the base layer due to its high melting point and excellent thermal conductivity, which allows it to maintain structural integrity at the extreme high temperatures common in solar thermal applications. The interlayer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is utilised as a dielectric isolation layer, with the objective of reducing reflections and enhancing light trapping by leveraging its low refractive index and minimizing optical loss [35]. The uppermost layer is composed of tungsten (W) columns, which have been meticulously selected based on their high absorption coefficients in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges, in addition to their remarkable stability against degradation at elevated temperatures. The amalgamation of these materials ensures the equilibrium of optical absorption, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness, which are prerequisites for the effective harvesting of solar energy.
The solar absorber design, which is based on tungsten metal and comprises five columns of a hollow, symmetric configuration, is proposed in this paper. The design is characterised by a periodic array of cells arranged in a square lattice pattern, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). Fig. 1. (b) presents a three-dimensional representation of a unit absorber, with each unit comprising three layers: titanium (Ti) in the bottom layer, silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the middle layer, and tungsten (W) in the top layer. The uppermost stratum comprises an arrangement of five tungsten columns set at regular intervals, with each column boasting a hollow square cross-section. The design objective is to achieve high absorption efficiency of broad-spectrum solar radiation, with the aim of utilising the unique properties of each material and the geometric configuration of the structure. Fig. 1 (c) and (d) represent the top and side views of the absorber, respectively, and the periodicity of the structure, denoted by (p), determines the spacing between neighboring units and affects the diffraction and resonance properties, where p = 500 nm. The specific dimensions of this absorber are as follows: the width of the small square excavation around the perimeter is w1 = 80 nm, the width of the large central square as a whole is w2 = 150 nm, the width of the small square around the perimeter as a whole is w3 = 100 nm and the distance of the small square around the perimeter from the far point of the center is w4 = 80 nm, which corresponds to the width of the columns and the spacing labeled in Fig. 1. (c). The heights of the layers of the structure are thickness of the titanium base layer h1 = 300 nm, thickness of the silica layer h2 = 100 nm, and height of the tungsten column h3 = 900 nm, as shown in the side view of Fig. 1 (d). These parameters are optimized through numerical simulations, with the aim of achieving broadband absorption of the solar spectrum. In order to evaluate the optical performance of solar absorbers, numerical simulations were performed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [36]. This method facilitates the precise calculation of electromagnetic field interactions within the nanostructured absorber. The simulations are executed under positive incidence conditions, with periodic boundary conditions applied in the x and y directions to simulate infinite arrays of cells and perfect matching (PML) boundary conditions in the z direction [37]. Absorption efficiencies are calculated over the wavelength range from 200 nm to 2300 nm, thereby covering the solar spectrum. In the configuration of the light source, a plane wave incident perpendicularly along the Z-direction is utilised as the incident light source, thereby defining the absorber's absorptivity as follows [[38], [39], [40]]:

This design optimizes broadband absorption through plasmon resonance and light trapping.

In this equation, A represents the absorptivity of the absorber, R represents the reflective efficiency of the absorber, and T represents the transmittance of the absorber. Given that the thickness of the absorber substrate exceeds the skin depth, the amplitude of the transmitted electromagnetic wave undergoes exponential decay, approaching zero at the substrate's output. Consequently, the equation for absorptivity can be simplified as follows [41]:
(2)
The relative impedance ZR of the absorber is defined as the ratio of the effective impedance Z of the absorber to the free space intrinsic impedance Z0 [42]:
(3)
In this equation, Z represents the effective impedance of the absorber, Z0 denotes the intrinsic impedance of free space, and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the structure are defined as S11 and S21, respectively [43]. The absorptivity A(ω) is defined as the proportion of the incident electromagnetic wave energy that is absorbed and is calculated as follows [44]:
(4)
The fundamental equation elucidates that the absorptance is equivalent to the residual of the total incident power minus the reflected power(
2)and the transmitted power(
2). The absorptivity A(ω) is closely related to the relative impedance ZR [43]. When the impedance of the absorber is matched to the impedance of the free space—that is, when the relative impedance ZR is equal to one, and the transmission coefficient S21 is equal to zero (a condition that is usually achieved by employing a sufficiently thick or backside reflective layer)—the reflection coefficient S11 of the structure reaches a minimum value (ideally zero) [45]. At this point, the absorptivity A(ω) reaches its maximum value, a state known as perfect absorption.
3. Optimization and results
The absorption spectrum of the absorber was obtained through FDTD simulation. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), the optimized absorber's spectral response characteristics within the 200–2300 nm band are depicted: the red curve denotes the absorptivity (A), the blue curve indicates the reflectivity (R), and the green curve represents the transmittance (T). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the absorb demonstrates an ultra-broadband high-efficiency absorption property. Specifically, the absorption within the 200–2300 nm band consistently exceeds 90 %, with an average absorption of 97.23 %. Furthermore, the effective perfect absorption bandwidth (i.e., absorption >90 %) of the absorber extends up to 2100 nm. The absorber demonstrates minimal transmittance, exhibiting a tendency to approach zero, as illustrated in the figure. Spectral absorptivity serves as a pivotal validation metric, facilitating the assessment of the absorber's practical application [46]. To this end, its calculation necessitates the integration of the AM1.5 solar irradiation spectrum, thereby yielding the weighted average absorptivity.

Absorptivity A is calculated by first quoting the formula for absorptivity from the previous paper, and then the absorptivity is brought into (5) [47], thus calculating the absorber absorption spectrum under conditional solar irradiation at AM1.5. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (b), a comparison is made between the effective absorption of the designed absorber and the solar irradiation energy. The red part of the figure represents the total energy of solar irradiation, the purple part indicates the portion of the absorber that is effectively absorbed, and the pink part signifies the loss of energy after solar irradiation. The absorber demonstrates an effective irradiation absorption of 96.3 %, exhibiting a mere 3.1 % energy loss. The comparison graph of solar irradiation and the absorption spectrum of the absorber demonstrates that the designed absorber possesses the advantages of a wide effective bandwidth, high absorption, and low loss [48]. A comparison was conducted among various references and the absorber design to determine its efficacy.
In order to thoroughly investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the high absorption phenomenon, we simulated the electromagnetic field distributions at wavelengths of 992 nm and 2016 nm, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 3 and 4. In the near-infrared region above 1500 nm, the absorption rate remains very high because it is driven by cavity resonance within the hollow tungsten pillar and guided mode resonance in the multilayer stacked structure, rather than primarily by localized surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) as in the shorter wavelength range [49]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the electric field distributions exhibit peak values ranging from 6.5 to 14.2 at 2016 nm when viewed from the top (XOY plane, Fig. 3 (a) and (b)). Furthermore, the field strengths attain their maximum values at the outer edges of the columns, particularly along the X-axis and Y-axis directions. As evidenced by the side views (XOZ planes, Fig. 3 (c)and (d), the high electric field region is predominantly situated on the outer side of the upper end of the column, with particularly pronounced intensity at 2016 nm (up to 14.2). At longer wavelengths, the electric field penetrates deeply into the hollow cavities, forming standing waves with uniform intensity distribution along the column height. Thereby substantiating the prevailing role of SPPs on the surface of the column. This localized enhancement has been shown to increase the interaction of light with the material, thereby enhancing the absorption efficiency [50,51]. Concurrently, the hollow region within the five-column structure constitutes an optical cavity, thereby engendering a standing wave effect when the wavelength of the incident light is congruent with the cavity's dimensions. The cavity resonance effect is found to be weak at 992 nm, with the electric field enhancement primarily concentrated in localized positions within the hollow region. When the wavelength is increased to 2016 nm, the cavity resonance effect is significantly enhanced, and the electric field is uniformly distributed in the cavity with higher intensity. The longer wavelength exhibits a stronger match to the dimensions of the cavity, thereby inducing a significant standing pattern that serves to amplify the magnitude of the electric field [52]. Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of increasing the wavelength from 992 nm to 2016 nm on the side view (c) and (d). The magnetic field exhibits a discernible standing wave pattern in the vertical direction (Z-axis), indicating the occurrence of a guided-mode resonance. The electromagnetic wave is confined and reflected multiple times in the vertical direction, thereby forming a standing wave. The side views of the magnetic field distribution (Fig. 4 (c)and 4. (d)) provide conclusive evidence for this wave confinement mechanism. The distinct, alternating patterns of strong and weak magnetic intensity along the Z-axis are the hallmark of a standing wave formation. This phenomenon arises from the incident electromagnetic waves being vertically confined within the cavity formed by the top tungsten structure and the bottom titanium substrate. The waves undergo multiple reflections at the interfaces (e.g., W/SiO2 and SiO2/Ti), and when the phase condition is met, the incoming and reflected waves interfere constructively. This establishes a stable guided-mode resonance, which is visually manifested as the observed stationary standing wave pattern. This resonance drastically enhances the light-matter interaction length and efficiency, serving as a fundamental mechanism for achieving near-perfect absorption [53,54]. As illustrated in the top view (a) and (b), the magnetic field enhancement region is concentrated around the top edge of the column and the hollow region. This indicates that the guided mode resonance not only enhances the field in the vertical direction but also optimizes the field distribution in the horizontal direction through the periodic structure. Concurrently, the guided mode resonance further augments the magnetic field through the interference effect between the multilayer structures. A thorough examination of the magnetic and electric field distribution diagrams reveals that the solar absorber employs a synergistic effect arising from surface plasmon resonance, cavity resonance, and guided mode resonance to achieve high efficiency absorption [55]. Its distinctive design, characterized by symmetry, a hollow cavity, and a multilayer structure, optimizes the interaction between light and the material, thereby rendering it potentially applicable in the field of solar energy absorption.

To further explore the absorption mechanism of the designed absorber, we calculated its dispersion curve and normalized impedance matching, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. (a) presents the SPP dispersion curve at the tungsten-air interface. The real part Re(k_spp) starts high in the UV–visible region, indicating strong momentum mismatch with free-space light and enabling localized SPP excitation at the edges of the hollow tungsten columns (consistent with the electric field hotspots observed in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 at 992 nm and 2016 nm) [56]. As wavelength increases into the NIR, Re(k_spp) decreases monotonically toward the light line, facilitating extended propagation and coupling with guided modes in the multilayer stack. The imaginary part |Im(k_spp)| peaks around 400–600 nm, reflecting the maximum ohmic loss of tungsten at short wavelengths, and then drops sharply in the near-infrared region (above The low Im(k_spp) in tungsten at NIR (from dispersion analysis, |Im(k_spp)| < 107 m−1 beyond 1400 nm) minimizes ohmic losses, allowing sustained resonance.1400 nm < 10^7 m−1). This low-loss state in the long-wavelength region is consistent with the uniform magnetic field distribution observed inside the cavity at 2016 nm, where the damping decreases, resulting in stronger cavity resonance and multiple internal reflections, thus achieving a wide absorption bandwidth. Fig. 5. (b) shows the normalized impedance Z_norm = Z/Z_0 extracted from the simulated reflection coefficient (where Z_0 = 377 Ω is the free-space impedance). Over most of the 200–2300 nm band, the real part Re(Z_norm) is close to 1, while the imaginary part Im(Z_norm) remains close to zero (<0.2), indicating excellent matching with free space. This near-ideal condition (Re(Z_norm) ≈ 1, Im(Z_norm) ≈ 0) suppresses reflection loss, and in critical coupling, the incident light is completely captured by the combined effects of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation on the structured tungsten surface, resonance of the hollow pentagonal cavity, and guided-mode resonance at the Ti/SiO2/W interface. Therefore, these results confirm the synergistic effect of SPP, cavity resonance, and guided mode resonance [[57], [58], [59]].

The thermal radiation efficiency of an absorber is a critical indicator of its performance. Thermal radiation efficiency is defined as the ability of an absorber to convert received solar radiation into thermal radiation. According to Planck's radiation law, the thermal radiation spectrum can be expressed as [60]:
(6)
where Bλ(T) denotes the radiant energy per unit wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. This formula delineates the radiation distribution of an ideal blackbody at a specific temperature. The thermal radiation efficiency is typically expressed in terms of absorptivity A(λ) and radiation loss. For an absorber, the thermal radiation efficiency, denoted by η(T), is expressed as follows [61,62]:
(7)
The quantity A(λ) signifies the absorptivity of the absorber at wavelength λ. Bλ(T) denotes the spectral radiance of a blackbody, as given by Planck's law (Eq. (6)). The radiative properties of an ideal blackbody are governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which establishes a correlation between the total radiant energy of the object, E(T), and its temperature [63].
(8)
It can be demonstrated that the value of σ is equivalent to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and that T is equivalent to a temperature measurement. The radiant energy of an ideal blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. Conversely, the radiant energy of an actual absorber is influenced by its absorptivity, reflectivity, and other factors, resulting in a radiation efficiency that is lower than that of an ideal blackbody. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 (d), the thermal radiation efficiency of the structure can be calculated as a function of temperature, according to Equations (6), (7), (8). This figure illustrates the overall thermal radiation efficiency of the absorber as a function of temperature [64]. The graph illustrates a gradual increase in thermal radiation efficiency with an increase in temperature, ranging from 90 % at 200 K to over 95 % at 1800 K. This phenomenon is of particular significance as it demonstrates the stability and high level of thermal radiation efficiency under extreme operating conditions [65]. This performance is of particular importance because it demonstrates the absorber's thermal radiation efficiency remains stable and high even under extreme operating conditions. This level of robustness is paramount for the effective functioning of solar energy systems, where absorbers must demonstrate unwavering performance across a substantial temperature range. To this end, we have simulated the thermal radiation spectra of the absorber at three different temperatures: 1000 K, 1500 K, and 1800 K. The results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 6 (a), (b), and (c). Tungsten exhibits excellent oxidation resistance in vacuum or inert atmospheres due to its high melting point and low oxygen affinity under low oxygen partial pressure, maintaining superior performance even at extremely high temperatures. However, in air or oxygen-rich environments, at temperatures above approximately 873–973 K, tungsten undergoes rapid parabolic-linear oxidation, generating volatile WO3, which sublimates above 1073 K, leading to significant mass loss and structural degradation. Titanium forms a protective TiO2 layer at moderate temperatures, but oxidation accelerates in air above 1073 K, forming multiple oxide layers (rutile + suboxide) and cracking, allowing oxygen to dissolve into the substrate, thus impairing adhesion and integrity. SiO2 interlayers offer some diffusion barrier properties, but devitrification or reactions occur at extreme temperatures. No high-temperature experiments were conducted in this study. All reference data regarding thermal properties (simulations at 573–1073 K and theoretical efficiencies up to 1800 K) are derived from calculations. Thermal radiation efficiency calculations employ Planck's law and a fixed absorption spectrum, representing an ideal, undegraded structure. Therefore, potential oxidation effects do not affect our simulation results, as the model assumes a pristine, oxide-free structure in a non-oxidizing environment. Each figure compares the radiation from the thermal radiator (red region) with the ideal blackbody radiation (black curve) in the wavelength range from 0 to 2.5 μm. Fig. 6. (a) demonstrates that at T = 1000 K, the absorber has a thermal radiation efficiency of 95.4 % and only 4.6 % of the energy is lost in the form of thermal radiation losses. The absorber's efficacy in converting solar radiation into useable thermal energy is demonstrated. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (b), at a temperature of 1500 K (K), the thermal radiation efficiency increases to 96.1 %, while the thermal radiation loss decreases to only 3.9 %. This indicates that the absorber's efficiency is further enhanced with an increase in temperature. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 (c), the radiation efficiency attains its maximum value of 96.4 % at a temperature of 1800 K, resulting in a significant reduction of the heat loss to 3.6 %. Assuming absorption is wavelength-independent and there is no structural degradation, the simulated thermal radiation efficiency exceeds 95 % at 1800 K (losses <4.6 %). However, this represents the theoretical upper limit of performance under ideal conditions. Tungsten's high melting point (3422 °C) and low vapor pressure endow the material with inherent stability, while the natural TiO2 passivation layer on the titanium substrate provides corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, at temperatures above 1000 K, long-term stability may be limited by potential interdiffusion at the W/SiO2 and SiO2/Ti interfaces and by the mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) (W: ∼4.5 × 10−6 K−1, SiO2: ∼0.5 × 10−6 K−1). "10−6 K−1, Ti: ∼8.6 × 10−6 K−1), and oxidation may occur in non-vacuum environments [[66], [67], [68]]. In summary, the proposed absorb demonstrates close to ideal blackbody characteristics regarding its radiation spectrum, particularly within the infrared and visible regions. The absorber's high absorption efficiency and low thermal radiation loss characteristics are comparable to those of an ideal blackbody radiator, rendering it a suitable candidate for solar energy harvesting applications. This broadband absorber demonstrates considerable promise for applications at elevated temperatures and is particularly well suited for enhancing the efficiency of solar thermal conversion systems. While the absorber achieves excellent broadband solar capture (AM1.5 weighted absorptivity of 96.3 %), it is not optimized for spectral selectivity. Therefore, the mid-infrared emissivity is estimated to be moderate to high, which would result in higher radiative losses at extremely high temperatures compared to dedicated selective absorbers. This trade-off favors maximizing solar energy utilization and structural robustness, rather than pursuing extremely low thermal radiation. Please note that all high-temperature assessments are based on simulations and assume an inert or vacuum environment to prevent oxidation. In air, tungsten oxidizes significantly above 873–973 K (forming volatile WO3), and titanium oxidizes significantly above 1073 K (forming a thick, cracked rutile oxide layer), which can degrade performance. Therefore, the simulation results represent protected environments (e.g., vacuum receivers or concentrated solar power systems filled with inert gases) and do not account for oxidative degradation.

The subsequent section will address the impact of distinct absorbing structures and materials on the absorption efficiency of the absorber. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) illustrate the absorption performance of the designed absorber at varying wavelengths following the replacement of the top material and the modification of the structural design. As illustrated in Fig. 7. (a), the figure demonstrates the disparate absorption efficiencies of various absorbers when varied materials (W, V, Cr, SiO2, Al2O3) are utilised as the top materials. Tungsten (W) exhibits high absorption in the wavelength range of 500–2000 nm, particularly in the near-infrared region, where the absorption approaches 100 %. As demonstrated by the extinction coefficient curve, tungsten exhibits a high degree of light absorption, particularly within the near-infrared spectral range. In comparison with alternative materials, tungsten demonstrates a superior performance in terms of efficiency. Two materials, vanadium (V) and chromium (Cr), exhibit low absorption in the visible and near-infrared bands. While they display absorption in specific wavelength ranges, such as around 500 nm, their overall performance remains inferior to that of tungsten. The following elements are of particular interest in this study: silicon dioxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The absorption properties of SiO2 and Al2O3 demonstrate low absorption in the 500-2000 nm band. This property is particularly evident when compared to tungsten and vanadium, where the absorption capacity is significantly weaker. As illustrated in Fig. 7 (b), the impact of varying structural designs (Case 1-Case 5) on the absorption rate is evident. The Case 1 design displays elevated broadband absorption performance, particularly within the visible and near-infrared spectrum (500–1500 nm). The absorber's absorption rate approaches 100 %, suggesting that its columnar structure possesses effective light trapping capabilities. The enhanced absorption efficiency of this absorber is strongly associated with the augmentation efficiency of its surface equipartition excitation resonance and guided mode resonance [69]. Case 2 adopts the cross structure, and its absorption efficiency is not significantly different from that of Case 1 before 1200 nm. However, when the wavelength exceeds 1200 nm, Case 2 exhibits a substantial decrease in absorption rate compared to Case 1. Furthermore, the absorption rate of Case 2 is lower than that of Case 1 in the long wavelength range. Case 3 retains the hollow structure of the middle columns while eliminating the hollow structure of the four columns at the edges. An examination of the absorption spectrum reveals that, in the initial phase, the absorption rate exhibits minimal deviation from that of Case 1. However, when the wavelength exceeds 1300 nm, the decline in cavity resonance leads to a substantial reduction in the absorption rate. Consequently, the absorption efficiency in the latter phase is less efficient than that of the Case 1 structure. Case 4 demonstrates a reduction in the number of columns, an absorption spectrum that is more volatile and unstable before 1000 nm, and a significant decrease in the absorption rate after 1000 nm. This results in an overall absorption efficiency that is not as effective as that of the Case 1 structure. Case 5 involves a reduction in the distance between columns. The absorption spectrum indicates a decrease in the absorption rate that is linear after 1000 nm, due to the absence of a specific resonance efficiency. Subsequent to this initial phase, the rate of absorption declines in a linear fashion [70]. When combined with the picture analysis, it is evident that the designed absorber exhibits superior performance in terms of absorption rate, absorption bandwidth for efficient absorption, and stability when compared to other structures [71]. These further underscores the efficacy of the designed absorber.

In the design of the absorber, the material and absorption structure are not the only factors influencing the absorption efficiency. The relevant parameters of the overall structure also have a certain impact on the absorption rate. The subsequent section will focus on the comparison of the efficiency of the parameters of the structure on the absorption, as illustrated in Fig. 8. As illustrated in Fig. 8 (a), the absorption spectra of varying w1 (hollow square width) demonstrates a direct correlation between width and wavelength. Specifically, the data show a gradual increase in the overall intensity of the absorption spectrum with an increase in width, ranging from 1200 nm to 1900 nm. Notably, at a width of 80 nm, the overall intensity of the spectrum at 200 nm–2300 nm is observed to exceed that of other widths. Fig. 8. (b) shows the efficiency of different w2 (center square width) on the absorption efficiency. As shown in the figure, the increase of w2 also leads to a slow increase in the absorption bandwidth, after w2 increases to 150 nm its absorption intensity decreases to 1500–2000 nm: Fig. 8. (c) shows the absorption spectra of different w3 (small square width), when w3 increases to 95–100 the overall length of the absorption band is greater than that of the other widths when the absorption band. As illustrated in Fig. 8 (d), the efficiency of varying w4 (the distance of the small square from the center) on the absorber's absorption efficiency is demonstrated. It is evident that the effective absorption bandwidth of the absorber is substantially larger when w4 = 80 nm in comparison to other w4 widths. Fig. 8. (e) illustrates the impact of varying h2 (the thickness of the SiO2 layer) on the absorber's extinction coefficient. In the change of d2, when h2 increased to 100 nm, after 1500–2000 nm absorption intensity slightly decreased (see Fig. 8 (f)). For different h3 (column height) absorption spectra, as h3 continues to increase, the high intensity of the absorption band is also increasing to 900 nm after 1500–2000 nm absorption intensity slightly decreased. In conjunction with the aforementioned analysis, the optimal parameters of the structure are determined to be w1 = 80 nm, w2 = 150 nm, w3 = 100 nm, w4 = 80 nm, h2 = 100 nm, h3 = 900 nm.

In addition, a consideration of the absorber's practical applications is imperative on a daily basis. The angle and polarization (TE/TM) of the incident light are the key variables that affect the performance of an absorber in a real working environment. In order to gain a more profound understanding of the absorber's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, this section will analyze the absorption characteristics at different incident angles and TE/TM polarization states [72,73]. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) illustrate the impact of TE polarization mode and TM polarization mode on the absorptivity at varying incidence angles (ranging from 0° to 60°). As demonstrated in Fig. 9, the increase in the angle of incidence from 0° to 50° does not result in significant changes in the overall level of absorption, which typically remains in the vicinity of 1. However, when the angle of incidence increases from 50° to 60°, a slight decrease in the effective absorption bandwidth of the absorb is observed. Nevertheless, the bandwidth of 1700 nm remains relatively constant. The period p = 500 nm is significantly smaller than the longest wavelength (2300 nm), placing the structure deep in the metamaterial regime (p ≪ λ) across the entire band. This prevents propagation of diffracted orders into free space (except zeroth order), ensuring effective medium behavior even at oblique incidence. A comparative analysis reveals that there is negligible variation in the absorption efficiencies across a range of incidence angles for both TE and TM polarization modes. This finding suggests that the design exhibits enhanced wide-angle adaptability [74,75]. As illustrated in Fig. 9 (c), the absorber's absorption spectra are depicted in both TE and TM modes. The figure indicates that the absorption spectra plot of the absorber in TE and TM modes exhibit significant overlaps, a consequence of the absorber's symmetrical design. The figure shows a significant overlap in the absorption spectra of the absorber in TE and TM modes, which is due to the symmetrical design of the absorber. For oblique incidence angles, the hollow vertical cylinder acts as a low-Q resonant cavity with a wide angular receiving range, while the guided mode in the planar Ti/SiO2 layer supports propagation with a minimum cutoff angle below 60°. Compared to asymmetric or sparsely symmetrical designs (such as cross-shaped or strip-shaped), the pentagonal symmetry and high-density stacking eliminate angle-dependent phase mismatch, thus achieving the observed omnidirectional performance despite the seemingly complex geometry. This design renders the absorber's performance largely independent of the direction of polarization of the incident light, thereby conferring a high degree of insensitivity to polarization [76]. The analysis depicted in Fig. 9 indicates that the absorb exhibits a high degree of insensitivity to both the polarization angle and the wide-angle adaptability. This characteristic enables it to function with greater stability under variable light conditions, a property that renders it universally applicable. We have summarized some key data on relevant absorbers in recent years, as shown in Table 1.

The absorber in this paper has a working bandwidth of 200–2300 nm, which has a significant advantage in short-wave coverage compared to other comparative schemes. Compared to Ref. [77] (300–2500 nm) and [78] (400–2200 nm), this paper extends the absorption band to the deep ultraviolet region of 200 nm, which more completely covers the AM1.5 solar spectrum (including the ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared core energy region of 200–2300 nm, accounting for more than 99 % of the total solar radiation). The average absorptivity reached 97.23 %, which is higher than 96 % in Ref. [77], ">95 % in Ref. [78] and "High (>95 %)" in Ref. [79]. The AM1.5 weighted absorptivity was 96.3 %, which is significantly higher than 95 % in Ref. [77] and ">94 % in Ref. [78], with an energy loss of only 3.1 %. In actual photovoltaic and photothermal conversion scenarios, the energy utilization efficiency is better and the polarization stability angle of the absorber reaches 60°, which is higher than the angle in other literature. This means that the absorber can still maintain stable absorption performance in scenarios where the solar incident angle changes greatly, without the need for additional angle tracking devices, thus reducing the system complexity of practical applications.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, a tungsten (W)-based five-column hollow symmetric solar absorber design is proposed. This design adopts a periodic cell array structure, with titanium (Ti) at the bottom, silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the middle, and tungsten (W) columns at the top. Through the optimization of material selection and structural parameters, the absorber attains efficient broadband absorption within the 200–2300 nm band. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results demonstrate that the average absorption in this band reaches 97.23 %, the effective absorption bandwidth (i.e., absorption >90 %) reaches 2100 nm, and the weighted average absorption under AM1.5 condition is 96.3 %, with only 3.1 % energy loss. A comparison of the present design with existing absorbers in the literature reveals significant advantages in both absorption bandwidth and absorption efficiency. The analysis of the electromagnetic field distribution reveals that the absorber's efficacy is attributable to the synergistic effect of surface plasma resonances (SPPs), cavity resonances, and guided mode resonances. Thermal radiation analysis indicates that the absorber maintains a thermal radiation efficiency of more than 90 % within the high-temperature range of 573–1073 K. Notably, at 1800 K, the thermal radiation efficiency achieves 96.4 %, with a minimal heat loss of 3.6 %, thereby demonstrating exceptional high-temperature stability. Furthermore, the absorber demonstrates notable robustness with respect to both the incident angle and the polarization state. Additionally, absorptivity exhibits stability over the range of 0°–60° incident angles and TM/TE polarizations, thereby ensuring adaptability to a variety of light conditions. In summary, the three-layer metamaterial solar absorber proposed in this study demonstrates excellent performance in broadband absorption, high-temperature stability, and angular adaptability. This provides a practical solution for the industrial application of solar thermal technology. Subsequent research endeavors will concentrate on enhancing the fabrication process, reducing production costs, and conducting further exploration into its potential applications in practical scenarios.
