Abstract
Rock masses in high-altitude and extremely cold regions are generally characterized by ice-filled fractures, pores, and joints, which are prone to deterioration and instability under dynamic disturbances. To investigate the effects of ice-filled fractures on the mechanical properties and failure characteristics of rocks, uniaxial compression tests were conducted on sandstone specimens with ice-filled fractures of varying inclinations and lengths. Their mechanical responses, acoustic emission (AE) characteristics, and instability mechanisms were systematically analyzed. The results indicate that: (1) Fracture inclination and length significantly affect mechanical parameters (e.g., compressive strength, elastic modulus) of the specimens. All parameters reach the minimum when the ice-filled fracture inclination is 45°, while they decrease continuously with the increase in fracture length. (2) The deformation and failure process of the specimens can be divided into four stages, presenting a tensile-shear mixed failure mode. The RA/AF ratio increases first and then decreases with fracture inclination (peaking at 75°) and decreases continuously with increasing fracture length, confirming that tensile failure dominates in all specimens. (3) The ultimate instability of the specimens is induced by the interaction between wing cracks or between wing cracks and secondary cracks. Increases in both inclination and length of ice-filled fractures intensify crack propagation and specimen damage. (4) A damage constitutive equation established based on statistical distribution theory and the Drucker-Prager (Dsingle bondP) strength criterion yields a validation error of 0.11 %–9.77 %, which can accurately depict the stress-strain behavior. This study reveals the instability mechanism of ice-filled fractured sandstone under water-ice phase transition at multiple scales, providing valuable insights for predicting the mechanical properties of rock masses and ensuring the safety and stability of geotechnical engineering in high-altitude cold regions.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the state has intensified the construction of mining projects in high-altitude and cold regions in northwestern China, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. These areas are rich in surface water, and there are more groundwater-rich zones in regions close to the Yellow River Basin. Under alpine conditions, water-ice phase transition occurs, causing original defects such as fractures, pores, and joints within the rock mass to be filled with ice, thus forming ice-filled fractured rock masses. Affected by dynamic loads such as excavation disturbances and blasting, these ice-filled fractures are activated and expanded, forming macroscopic through-going fracture surfaces. This leads to the deterioration of the mechanical properties of the rock mass, which in turn results in rock mass failure and instability disasters, posing a serious threat to the safety and stability of geotechnical engineering and the lives of construction personnel. Therefore, the mechanical responses and instability mechanisms of ice-filled fractured rock masses have attracted extensive attention from both academic and engineering circles.
To deepen the understanding of rock mass deformation and failure, scholars have conducted extensive studies on rock masses from multiple perspectives. Huang et al. (2019) recorded the strength changes and internal crack propagation characteristics of sandstones with various fractures under different confining pressures. Chen et al. (2023) discussed the intrinsic relationships between compression-shear angles, fracture distributions, and crack propagation. Xu et al. (2024) studied the effects of fractures on the uniaxial compressive strength, peak strength of rocks, and their correlation with fracture geometries. Ma et al. (2025) systematically analyzed the failure modes and damage mechanisms of granite specimens with different joint dip angles. Wang et al. (2025) systematically investigates the effects of arc-shaped crack scale on the mechanical properties, energy evolution, and failure patterns of rock masses. Zhang et al. (2024) carried out acoustic emission tests to explore the propagation of microcracks and failure mechanisms in fractured rock masses. In addition, many scholars have studied the complete rock mass. While the aforementioned studies primarily focus on fractured rock specimens under room temperature conditions, in actual engineering scenarios-particularly in high-altitude, cold-region rock masses-fractures are often filled with ice. It is well established that water expands in volume upon freezing. For a long time, due to technological constraints, the volume expansion induced by water-ice phase transition in rock pores and fractures has been regarded as the primary source of frost heaving force. With advancements in technology and deeper insights, scholars have gradually reached a consensus: the combined effects of water migration and volume expansion induced by water-ice phase transition during freezing are the main drivers of frost heaving force (Liu et al., 2015). Sun et al. (2023) conducted laboratory low-temperature experiments on rock-like fractured specimens, documenting the evolution of frost cracking and interactions between freezing-induced fractures. Li et al. (2025) discussed the damage characteristics of anchored fractured rock masses under freeze-thaw cycles. Chen and Lin (2023) applied the Hoek-Brown strength criterion to observe degradation patterns in multi-fractured rock specimens and analyzed their shear behavior. Lai et al. (2024) investigated the morphological and mechanical properties of rock mass frost damage under varying fracture depths. Liu et al. (2020) utilized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to characterize the mechanical properties and damage evolution of fractured sandstone subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Niu et al. (2024) observed fracture propagation and microstructural changes in fractured granite under the coupled effects of hydrochemical solutions and freeze-thaw cycles. Wang et al. (2022) performed uniaxial compression tests on rock-like specimens at low temperatures, elucidating the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms under frost heaving forces.
Notably, most existing studies have focused on intact rock masses or fractured rock masses, analyzing their mechanical properties (such as strength, elastic modulus, and strain) as well as macroscopic failure characteristics. However, research and analysis on ice-filled fractured rock masses containing ice inclusions and their instability models remain relatively scarce.
Based on this, axial loading tests were conducted on ice-filled fractured sandstone with different angles and different lengths of ice-filled fractures to analyze the degradation effects on its mechanical properties. The study investigated the acoustic emission characteristics of ice-filled fractured sandstone, revealed the crack evolution laws, and established a damage constitutive equation, which was then validated for rationality. A mechanical model for ice-containing fractured sandstone was developed to clarify its instability and failure mechanisms. The findings aim to provide valuable references for predicting the mechanical properties of rock masses in alpine regions and ensuring the safety and stability of geotechnical engineering projects.
2. Specimen preparation and experimental scheme
2.1. Specimen preparation
The sandstone of a mine in Zaduo County, southern Qinghai was selected as the research object. A relatively homogeneous sandstone was selected as the research object, and SEM images of its surface and cross-section were collected to characterize and analyze the microstructure (Fig. 1). SEM images revealed that the internal microstructure of the sandstone exhibited abundant pore spaces, ranging from a few micrometers to several tens of micrometers in size.

In accordance with the International Society of Rock Mechanics Test Procedures and the Standard for Experimental Methods of Engineering Rock Masses, large sandstone blocks were processed into cylindrical rock samples measuring φ50 mm × 100 mm by using cutting machines, coring machines, and grinding machines. The deviation in sample edge length was controlled to ≤0.1 mm, and the unevenness of the two end faces was ≤0.02 mm. The through-fractured sandstone is prepared by wire cutting technology, and the fracture is located in the center of the specimen. The cylindrical rock samples were processed into through-fractured sandstone with different fracture angles (θ) and different fracture lengths (l), as shown in Fig. 2. Uniaxial compression tests were conducted on ice-filled fractured sandstone with different fracture angles (θ = 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°). Additionally, uniaxial compression tests were performed on ice-filled fractured sandstone with fracture angles of 30° and 60° at different fracture lengths (l = 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm). Each test group consisted of 6 specimens. For ease of recording, the specimens were labeled according to the format of “fracture angle-fracture length”. For example, the specimen labeled 0–25 represents ice-filled fractured sandstone with a fracture angle of 0° and a fracture length of 25 mm; the specimen labeled 30–5 represents ice-filled fractured sandstone with a fracture angle of 30° and a fracture length of 5 mm.

Preparation of ice-filled fractured sandstone. The prepared fractured rock specimens were fully immersed in water, allowing them to absorb water freely. The water level was checked every 12 h, and if insufficient, it was promptly replenished. Once the rock specimens stopped absorbing water, they were considered to have reached a fully saturated state. The excess water on the surface of the specimen was wiped off with a wet towel. In order to prevent the prefabricated fractures from overflowing through the sample, each specimen was wrapped with a polyethylene cling film, and both ends of the prefabricated fractures were sealed with a waterproof transparent tape. Then, the water was injected into the prefabricated fractures with a syringe and placed in a low-temperature box with a pre-set temperature (−20 °C) for 24 h. The water injected into the prefabricated fractures is boiled and cooled deionized water. Prior to injection, it has undergone boiling for defoaming, and after being cooled to room temperature, it is slowly injected via a syringe to avoid generating new bubbles. During the period, the freezing of water in the fractures was checked every hour. If there was water leakage, the syringe should be used to replenish the water in time to ensure that the fractures were fully filled with ice. After the sample preparation is completed, the fresh-keeping film is torn off and the redundant ice treatment on the surface of the sample is placed in a low temperature box at −20 °C for test use. The ice-filled fractured sandstone samples prepared by are shown in Fig. 3.

2.2. Experimental scheme
The experiment utilized the Changchun Kexin SAW-2000kN microcomputer-controlled electro-hydraulic servo rock testing system and the Beijing Shenghua SAEU2S multi-channel acoustic emission monitoring system to conduct uniaxial compression tests and acoustic emission tests on the specimens, as shown in Fig. 4.

Before the beginning of the test, to minimize the impact of boundary effects, Vaseline was applied to the upper and lower surfaces of the sensors to ensure full coupling between the specimens and the sensors. To better observe the failure characteristics of the specimens later, the specimens were removed from the low-temperature box, secured with rubber bands, and quickly fixed to the pressure machine's compression columns. The acoustic emission sensors were positioned as shown in Fig. 5. The pressure machine was then started, and the specimens were loaded under displacement control at a rate of 0.2 mm/min, with a pre-loading force of 0.2 kN. After pre-loading, the instrument's acquisition values were reset to zero. The acoustic emission system was set to a signal sampling frequency of 3 MHz, with a threshold value of 40 dB, and a loading rate of 0.2 mm/min. Once all acquisition systems were confirmed to be functioning properly, all systems were started simultaneously and continued until the specimens failed. Afterward, all systems were stopped simultaneously, and the data was recorded.

3. Results and analysis
3.1. Mechanical response of ice-filled fractured sandstone
3.1.1. Peak strength
As shown in Fig. 6, the peak strength of the specimens exhibits a two-stage change as the angle θ of the ice-filled fractures increases: when θ increases from 0° to 45°, the peak strength slightly decreases from 28.3 MPa; when θ increases from 45° to 90°, the strength rapidly rises from 22.7 MPa to 48.0 MPa, an increase of 52.7 %. The sandstone specimen labeled 45–25 has the lowest peak strength at 22.7 MPa.

Fig. 6. Mechanical response of ice-filled fractured sandstone at different fracture angles.

In this study, specimens with ice-filled fracture angles of 30° and 60° were selected to investigate the influence of ice-filled fracture length on the peak strength of sandstone. As shown in Fig. 7(a), as the length of the ice-filled fractures increases, the peak strength of the specimens exhibits a declining trend. Specifically, when the fracture length increases from 5 mm to 10 mm, the strength of the θ = 60° test group shows no significant decrease, dropping only from 48.1 MPa to 47.5 MPa. However, the strength of the θ = 30° test group decreases rapidly, from 48.0 MPa to 36.4 MPa, a reduction of 24.2 %. When the fracture length ranges from 10 mm to 25 mm, the strength of both test groups decreases slightly. When the fracture length increases from 25 mm to 30 mm, the strength of the θ = 30° test group drops sharply, from 23.7 MPa to 15.9 MPa. For θ = 30°, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and peak strength follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.98; for θ = 60°, the relationship follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.97, indicating a strong fitting performance.

In summary, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a significant impact on the strength of ice-filled fractured sandstone, with larger inclination angles leading to more pronounced increases in peak strength. The strength of ice-filled fractured sandstone is lowest at θ = 45°. Additionally, the length of ice-filled fractures significantly affects the peak strength of the specimens. Longer ice-filled fractures result in lower specimen strength. Under the same ice-filled fracture length, the compressive strength of the test group with smaller fracture angles is notably lower than that of the group with larger angles, indicating that specimens with smaller fracture angles are more sensitive to fracture length.
3.1.2. Elastic modulus
The elastic modulus is calculated from the experimental stress-strain curves following a standard procedure: after processing the raw data using Origin software, the linear elastic stage of the curves is identified, and the linear segment within this stage is fitted-with the slope of the fitted line serving as the elastic modulus.
As shown in Fig. 6, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a notable influence on the elastic modulus of the specimens. The elastic modulus of the specimens exhibits a two-stage change as the angle of the ice-filled fractures increases: when θ increases from 0° to 45°, the elastic modulus of the specimens slightly decreases; when θ increases from 45° to 90°, the elastic modulus shows a significant increase, rising from 29.719 GPa to 67.699 GPa, an increase of 56.1 %. The specimen labeled 45–25 has the lowest elastic modulus at 29.719 GPa.
As shown in Fig. 7(b), the length of ice-filled fractures has an obvious impact on the elastic modulus of the specimens. The specimen labeled 30–5 has the highest elastic modulus at 54.013 GPa, while the specimen labeled 30–30 has the lowest elastic modulus at 24.822 GPa. For θ = 30°, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and elastic modulus follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.98. The specimen labeled 60–5 has the highest elastic modulus at 65.166 GPa, while the specimen labeled 60–30 has the lowest elastic modulus at 44.866 GPa. For θ = 60°, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and elastic modulus follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.92.
In summary, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a highly impact on the elastic modulus of ice-filled fractured sandstone, with larger inclination angles leading to more pronounced increases in elastic modulus. The elastic modulus of the specimens is lowest at θ = 45°. Additionally, the length of ice-filled fractures strongly affects the elastic modulus of the specimens. Longer ice-filled fractures result in lower elastic modulus. Under the same ice-filled fracture length, the elastic modulus of the test group with smaller fracture inclination angles is notably lower than that of the group with larger angles. This indicates that fracture length has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the elastic modulus of specimens with smaller fracture angles.
3.1.3. Pre-peak stain energy
As shown in Fig. 6, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a marked influence on the pre-peak strain energy of the specimens. The relationship between the pre-peak strain energy and the angle of ice-filled fractures resembles a “V”-shaped curve, with the minimum value occurring at an angle of 45°, where the pre-peak strain energy is 7.111 J. When θ increases from 45° to 90°, the pre-peak strain energy of the specimens shows a significant increase, rising 58.3 %, with the maximum value occurring at an angle of 90°, where the pre-peak strain energy is 17.192 J.
As shown in Fig. 7(c), the length of ice-filled fractures has a substantial impact on the pre-peak strain energy of the specimens. The specimen labeled 30–5 has the highest pre-peak strain energy at 23.020 J, while the specimen labeled 30–30 has the lowest pre-peak strain energy at 5.657 J. For θ = 30°, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and pre-peak strain energy follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.89. The specimen labeled 60–5 has the highest pre-peak strain energy at 21.867 J, while the specimen labeled 60–30 has the lowest pre-peak strain energy at 9.879 J. In this case, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and pre-peak strain energy follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.97.
In summary, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a significant impact on the pre-peak strain energy of ice-filled fractured sandstone specimens. The relationship between pre-peak strain energy and the angle of ice-filled fractures resembles a “V”-shaped curve, with the maximum pre-peak strain energy occurring at θ = 90° and the minimum at θ = 45°. Additionally, the length of ice-filled fractures also affects the pre-peak strain energy of the sandstone specimens. Longer ice-filled fractures result in lower pre-peak strain energy. Under the same ice-filled fracture length, the pre-peak strain energy of the test group with smaller fracture angles is notably lower than that of the group with larger angles. This indicates that fracture length has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the pre-peak strain energy of specimens with smaller fracture angles.
3.1.4. Rock burst proneness
As shown in Fig. 8(a), the angle of ice-filled fractures also has a significant impact on the rock burst proneness of the specimens. The rock burst proneness index is used to quantify the rock burst proneness of sandstone, which is defined as the ratio of elastic strain energy density to dissipated strain energy density at the peak compressive strength of the rock specimens. According to the rock burst proneness classification rules (Gong et al., 2019)(rock burst proneness index <2: no rock burst proneness; 2 ≤ rock burst proneness index <5: low rock burst proneness; rock burst proneness index ≥5: high rock burst proneness), the specimen labeled 90–25 has the highest rock burst proneness index at 5.608, while the specimens labeled 0–25, 60–25, and 75–25 have rock burst proneness indices of 5.231, 5.275, and 5.306, respectively, all indicating high rock burst proneness. The specimens labeled 30–25 and 45–25 have rock burst proneness indices of 4.565 and 4.388, respectively, indicating low rock burst proneness. It can be observed that the rock burst proneness index of the specimens first decreases and then increases with the increase in the angle of ice-filled fractures, reaching its minimum at an angle of 45°. This suggests that when the angle of ice-filled fractures exceeds 45°, the specimens exhibit more pronounced plastic characteristics.

Fig. 8. Rock burst proneness laws of ice-filled fractured sandstone.

As shown in Fig. 8(b), the length of ice-filled fractures has a certain influence on the rock burst proneness index of the specimens. The specimen labeled 30–5 has the highest rock burst proneness index at 2.224, indicating low rock burst proneness. The rock burst proneness indices of the other five specimens are all less than 2, with the specimen labeled 30–30 having the lowest impact energy index at 0.577, indicating no impact tendency. In this case, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and rock burst proneness index follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.93. The specimen labeled 60–5 has the highest rock burst proneness index at 2.699, while the specimen labeled 60–10 has the next highest at 2.326, both indicating low impact tendency. The other four specimens show no impact tendency. In this case, the relationship between ice-filled fracture length and pre-peak strain energy follows 
, with a goodness-of-fit of 0.98.
Research indicates that the angle of ice-filled fractures has a significant impact on the rock burst proneness index of sandstone specimens. Experimental results show that the rock burst proneness index exhibits a “V”-shaped relationship with the fracture angle. When the fracture angle θ = 90°, the rock burst proneness index reaches its maximum value, while at θ = 45°, the rock burst proneness index drops to its minimum. Additionally, the length of ice-filled fractures also affects the rock burst proneness index of sandstone specimens, with a negative correlation between ice-filled fracture length and the rock burst proneness of sandstone. Longer ice-filled fractures result in lower impact tendency. Under the same fracture length conditions, the rock burst proneness index of the test group with smaller fracture inclination angles is significantly lower than that of the group with larger angles, indicating that ice-filled fracture length has a stronger inhibitory effect on the rock burst proneness of specimens with smaller angles. From an energy perspective, the longer the ice-filled fractures, the higher the proportion of post-peak dissipated strain energy in the specimens, resulting in less kinetic energy available for fragment movement and lower impact effects. In engineering practice, the use of hydraulic fracturing technology to prevent rock-burst is based on this principle.
3.2. Acoustic emission characteristics of ice-filled fractured sandstone
3.2.1. Analysis of stress-strain and acoustic emission characteristics
The relationship between axial stress, AE counts, and cumulative AE counts of sandstone specimens with ice-filled fractures as a function of axial strain is plotted. Based on the stress-strain curve and acoustic emission (AE) characteristics, the deformation and failure process of sandstone under uniaxial compression can be roughly divided into four stages (Jiang et al., 2024):
Microcrack compaction stage: both the stress-strain curve and the acoustic emission (AE) signal curve exhibit nonlinear growth. Sandstone specimens in their natural state contain a large number of initial defects, such as pores, cracks, and joints, due to long-term geological processes. At the beginning of loading, the inherent microcracks in the specimen and the microcracks at the ice-rock interface are compressed and closed under the applied load, accompanied by the generation of AE signals. During this stage, the slope of the stress-strain curve increases slowly, and the slope of the cumulative AE count curve is approximately zero. The reason is that, on one hand, the stress concentration at the tips of the ice-filled cracks leads to the closure of microcracks, and on the other hand, the internal stress within the specimen is still relatively low, and a significant number of pores and cracks have not yet closed.
Stable microcrack propagation stage: both the stress-strain curve and the acoustic emission (AE) signal curve exhibit quasi-linear growth. The microcracks inside the specimen have already closed during the compaction stage. As the stress increases, friction occurs between the microcracks and the ice-rock interface under the loading. The AE signals during this stage are relatively weaker compared to the previous stage, and the AE counts decrease. The stress-strain curve shows a quasi-linear rapid increase, and the slope of the curve approaches a constant value, which represents the elastic modulus of the specimen.
Unstable microcrack propagation stage: the stress-strain curve shows accelerated growth, and the acoustic emission (AE) signal curve exhibits nonlinear, step-like growth. The increase in AE counts and cumulative AE counts becomes more pronounced, indicating intensified crack activity within the material. As the axial stress continues to increase, pre-existing cracks in the rock specimen begin to propagate further, and new microcracks start to form. In certain regions, microcracks initiate and develop into localized cracks, accompanied by frequent AE events. This suggests that the rock specimen is progressively undergoing failure. During this stage, AE counts become more frequent and increasingly dense. Additionally, the cumulative AE counts show a distinct step-like increase.
Failure stage: After the previous stage, the rock specimen contains a large number of microcracks. In localized regions, stress concentration causes these microcracks to interconnect, forming localized macroscopic cracks. As the stress continues to increase, the microcracks in the specimen further propagate and connect. On one hand, they continue to form localized macroscopic cracks, and on the other hand, they link the already formed localized macroscopic cracks to create a main crack. The cracks in the specimen gradually evolve from localized fractures to a dominant macroscopic crack. The elastic strain energy accumulated within the specimen gradually reaches its storage limit. Once this limit is exceeded, large macroscopic cracks form, leading to the onset of unstable failure. The elastic energy stored in the specimen is released instantaneously, resulting in the final failure of the specimen.
As shown in Fig. 9, with the increase in angle, the maximum axial stress gradually increases, indicating that the material can withstand greater stress at higher angles. The AE counts and cumulative AE counts exhibit more pronounced fluctuations as the angle increases, suggesting more complex changes in the microstructure of the specimen. This leads to increased local stress concentration and release within the sandstone. At higher angles (θ = 75° and 90°), the specimen demonstrates more frequent local stress concentration and release events, which may be related to the anisotropic properties of the material.

Fig. 9. The relationship between axial stress, ringing counts, and cumulative ringing counts of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture angles as a function of axial strain.

As shown in Fig. 10, at a 60° angle, the material exhibits higher sensitivity to crack length, particularly at medium lengths (l = 20 mm), where the material's failure is more pronounced. At a 30° angle, the material is more sensitive to shorter crack lengths (l = 15 mm). At a 60° angle, as the crack length increases, stress concentration and release events within the material become more frequent, especially at longer crack lengths (l = 25 mm and 30 mm). In contrast, at a 30° angle, this effect is relatively less significant. At a 60° angle, the cumulative damage within the material increases significantly with increasing crack length, particularly at longer crack lengths (l = 25 mm and 30 mm). At a 30° angle, this effect is relatively less pronounced.

3.2.2. RA-AF characteristics of acoustic emission in ice-filled fractured sandstone
The RA (Rise Angle) and AF (Average Frequency) are two important parameters in acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. They can characterize the types of cracks in sandstone under axial loading and are used to analyze the internal crack failure mechanisms. The ratio of RA to AF is a classic indicator for distinguishing tensile/shear cracks in Acoustic Emission technology. Its classification criterion (RA/AF value) has been widely applied in rock mass research, and a value of 1 is selected as the dividing line in this study. This threshold is extensively used for crack classification in rock masses: Liu et al. (2023) adopted similar particle-grade specimens and achieved favorable results by synchronously observing the macroscopic morphology of crack propagation and AE signal characteristics. Referring to this analytical method, this study analyzes the RA and AF parameter values of ice-filled fractured sandstone specimens. Generally, high RA values and low AF values indicate that the internal cracks are primarily shear cracks, while low RA values and high AF values suggest tensile cracks (Cheng et al., 2023), as shown in Fig. 11. The calculation methods for these two parameters are as follows:

Fig. 11. Crack classification based on RA/AF.

Based on existing research findings, the shape and distribution of high-density regions in RA-AF scatter plots can effectively reflect the crack patterns in specimens. Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the high-density regions to gain insights into the crack mechanisms. Below is a detailed explanation of the approach and significance:
The angle of ice-filled fractures has a significant influence on the failure mode of sandstone specimens. Fig. 12 shows the kernel density plots of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture angles, and Table 1 presents the maximum RA values, maximum AF values, and RA/AF ratios for these specimens. From Fig. 12, it can be observed that the high-density regions exhibit triangular or rhombus-like shapes, indicating that the failure mode of the sandstone specimens is not singular but rather a mixed tensile-shear failure mode. From Table 1, it is evident that under the condition of a constant ice-filled fracture length of 25 mm, as the angle θ of the ice-filled fractures increases from 0° to 90°, the RA values of the specimens gradually increase, while the AF values show no clear trend. The RA/AF ratio initially increases and then decreases, with all ratios being less than 1. The maximum RA/AF value occurs at θ = 75°, suggesting that the failure mode is predominantly tensile, with internal cracks primarily being tensile cracks. When the angle θ = 90°, the AF value of the specimen increases sharply, and the RA/AF ratio decreases by 59.09 % compared to the maximum value, indicating that the failure mode remains predominantly tensile, but the proportion of tensile failure decreases.

The length of ice-filled fractures has a certain influence on the failure mode of sandstone specimens. Fig. 13 shows the kernel density plots of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture lengths at θ = 30°, and Table 2 presents the maximum RA values, maximum AF values, and RA/AF ratios for these specimens. Due to space limitations, the variation patterns of RA-AF for specimens with θ = 60° are similar to those with θ = 30°, so the analysis here focuses on the θ = 30° specimens as an example. From Fig. 13, it can be observed that the high-density regions of the specimens exhibit triangular shapes, indicating that the failure mode of the sandstone specimens is a mixed tensile-shear failure mode. According to Table 2, under the condition of a constant ice-filled fracture angle of 30°, as the ice-filled fracture length increases from 5 mm to 30 mm, the RA values of the specimens show no clear trend, while the AF values first decrease and then increase, with the minimum AF value occurring at l = 10 mm. The RA/AF ratio gradually decreases with increasing fracture length, but all values remain less than 1. This suggests that the failure mode is predominantly tensile, with internal cracks primarily being tensile cracks. However, the intensity of tensile failure and the frequency of tensile crack formation both show a decreasing trend.

Fig. 15. Curves of the relationship between ice-filled fracture length, b-value, and energy (θ = 30°).

The variation of acoustic emission b-value is directly related to crack evolution and stress state (Sun et al., 2025). At the initial loading stage, the b-value is generally low, with only a small number of primary microcracks existing inside the rock, resulting in a small number of AE events and weak energy release. As the load increases, the b-value gradually rises, corresponding to the closure of microcracks and the initiation of secondary small cracks. The proportion of small AE events increases, and the energy points show a scattered low-amplitude distribution. After entering the linear elastic deformation stage, the b-value remains relatively stable, indicating that the crack propagation and closure inside the rock are in dynamic equilibrium at this time, and the occurrence frequencies of large and small AE events are relatively uniform.
When the loading enters the plastic deformation stage, the b-value first increases sharply, then decreases rapidly, and subsequently remains at a low level, as shown in the pink boxed area in the figures. This indicates a significant increase in the proportion of large AE events, where microcracks inside the rock begin to connect and develop into macro-fractures, with a notable rise in the amplitude of energy release. In the stage approaching failure, the b-value curve enters a state of violent fluctuation, and sharp ups and downs of the b-value can be observed in all specimen curves. The larger the fracture angle and the longer the fracture length, the more intense the fluctuation of the b-value. Meanwhile, the AE energy exhibits concentrated release-red energy points are dense with a sudden increase in amplitude, corresponding to the rapid propagation of the main crack inside the rock.
From the perspective of failure precursors, the rapid decline of the b-value can be used as a key criterion. When the b-value drops sharply from the fluctuation peak to below a critical threshold, which should be slightly higher than the minimum b-value before failure to avoid the impact of approaching extreme values on early warning reliability-this region can be identified as the characteristic zone of failure precursors, corresponding to the descending segment of the b-value within the boxed area in the figures. At this stage, the stress-strain curve is usually accompanied by a significant stress drop; combined with the concentrated release of energy, it can be clearly determined that the rock is close to the critical point of unstable failure.
3.4. Crack evolution law of ice-filled fractured sandstone
The cracks in ice-filled fractured sandstone are classified into eight types (Chen et al., 2025): wing crack, secondary inclined crack, secondary coplanar crack, oblique crack, secondary derived crack, wing crack derived cracks, far-field crack, and flacking off as shown in Fig. 16. From Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, it can be observed that the final failure of the rock specimens is primarily caused by wing cracks or the combined action of wing cracks and secondary cracks. Below is a detailed analysis of each type:

Fig. 18. Crack failure mode of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fractured lengths.

Fig. 17 is the crack failure mode of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fractured angles. It can be seen from the figure: 0–25 specimen, it generated 4 wing cracks. The cracks were of a single type and relatively narrow, and did not longitudinally penetrate the entire specimen. 30–25 specimen, it generated 2 wing cracks and 2 secondary inclined cracks. The wing cracks were wider and penetrated the entire specimen. The secondary inclined cracks extended approximately perpendicular to the ice-filled fracture from its tip toward the upper part of the specimen, with their width gradually decreasing. 45–25 specimen, it generated 2 wing cracks and 2 secondary inclined cracks. The wing cracks longitudinally penetrated the entire specimen, while the 2 secondary inclined cracks extended perpendicular to the ice-filled fracture toward both ends of the specimen. 60–25 specimen generated only 3 wing cracks. The wing crack originating from the lower tip of the ice-filled fracture was wider and extended to the specimen's end surface. The area near the ice-filled fracture exhibited blocky spalling. 75–25 specimen generated 1 wing crack and 1 wing crack derived crack. The cracks were wider and longitudinally penetrated the entire specimen. Spalling was observed near the lower tip of the ice-filled fracture. 90–25 specimen generated 3 wing cracks, 1 oblique crack, and 1 wing crack derived crack. The wing cracks not only longitudinally penetrated the entire specimen but also exhibited significantly increased width. Extensive spalling occurred at the ice-rock interface.
Overall, the angle of ice-filled fractures has a significant impact on the failure mode of the specimens. The pre-existing ice-filled fractures play a role in extending and connecting cracks, causing the cracks initiated from the natural pores and fractures within the specimen to interact more easily. This interaction leads to a reduction in the strength of the sandstone specimens and accelerates their failure. Notably, in the θ = 90° sandstone specimen, the wing cracks did not originate from the crack tips. The reason for this is that the influence of the pre-existing ice-filled fractures is minimal at this angle, making the specimen behave almost like an intact coal sample. Under axial loading, the pre-existing crack tips did not propagate; instead, failure initiated from within the coal body, resulting in splitting failure. As the angle of the pre-existing ice-filled fractures increases, the width of the wing cracks gradually increases, and the degree of specimen damage becomes more severe. This is because a larger inclination angle reduces the angle between the ice-filled fractures and the stress loading direction, decreasing the area of the ice-filled fractures and their surrounding regions subjected to load. This creates stress concentration zones near the ends of the ice-filled fractures, accelerating crack propagation and development until the cracks penetrate the entire specimen. When θ ≥ 60°, spalling occurs at the tips of the ice-filled fractures or at the ice-rock interface. This is due to the increased load on the ice-filled fractures and their surrounding areas as the fracture angle increases, creating high-stress concentration zones that result in rough failure surfaces accompanied by spalling. The failure mode of the specimens evolves from a single fracture surface to multiple fracture surfaces. This indicates that under high-stress conditions, an increase in the angle of ice-filled fractures promotes the initiation and propagation of microcracks in the rock.
Fig. 18 is the crack failure mode of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fractured lengths. It can be seen from the figure: in Fig. 18(a), the pre-existing ice-filled fractures all have an angle of 30°. The 30–5 specimen generated 2 wing cracks and 2 wing crack derived cracks. The directions of the wing cracks were opposite to that of the pre-existing ice-filled fractures, and the upper failure surface exhibited blocky spalling. The 30–10 specimen generated 3 wing cracks, with their directions opposite to that of the pre-existing ice-filled fractures, extending longitudinally through the entire specimen toward both ends. The 30–15 specimen generated 3 wing cracks, with their directions aligned with the pre-existing ice-filled fractures, opposite to the crack directions in the 30–10 specimen. The 30–20, 30–25, and 30–30 specimens all generated 2 wing cracks and 2 secondary inclined cracks, with similar crack morphologies and gradually increasing crack widths. In all test groups, the cracks propagated from the tips of the ice-filled fractures toward the end surfaces of the specimens and longitudinally penetrated the entire specimen as the load increased. In Fig. 18(b), the pre-existing ice-filled fractures all have an angle of 60°. Notably, macroscopically, all six specimens generated only 3 wing cracks, with a single type of crack, similar crack widths, and comparable crack morphologies. This largely suggests that variations in ice-filled fracture length do not necessarily play a dominant role in the instability failure mode of the 60° test group. When l ≤ 20 mm, the two cracks aligned with the direction of the ice-filled fractures longitudinally penetrated the entire specimen. However, when l ≥ 25 mm, the crack originating from the upper part of the ice-filled fracture did not penetrate the entire specimen.
Overall, the length of ice-filled fractures significantly affects the failure mode of the specimens. The longer the ice-filled fracture length, the wider the fracture width, and all wing cracks originate from the tips of the ice-filled fractures. This indicates that under axial loading, the tips of the prefabricated fractures bear more stress. As the press continues to load and reaches the specimen's bearing limit, the energy at the tips and surroundings of the ice-filled fractures is released instantaneously, forming a macroscopic failure surface. In the 30° test group, the phenomenon of spalling only occurs in specimens with l ≤ 15 mm, while in the 60° test group, the spalling of cracks only occurs in specimens with l ≤ 20 mm. This is because the smaller the length of the ice-filled fracture, the smaller the area of the stress concentration region at the fracture tip, which may lead to a more pronounced stress concentration effect and thus a more significant occurrence of spalling. Secondary derived cracks only occur in specimens with l ≤ 15 mm, indicating that the presence of long fractures makes the failure mode of the rock more inclined to tensile failure. Fractures are more likely to concentrate stress under uniaxial compression, which is conducive to the generation of secondary inclined cracks. Additionally, regarding the formation of reverse-sense and normal-sense cracks in sandstone specimens, literature review shows that when the tip of the ice-filled fracture is subjected to compressive stress, it macroscopically manifests as a reverse wing crack opposite to the direction of the prefabricated ice-filled fracture. Conversely, it manifests as a normal wing crack.
4. Damage constitutive equation and verification
4.1. Establishment of damage constitutive equation
When the ice-filled fractured sandstone samples continue to load, the microcracks inside the fractured sandstone gradually fails. Without considering the initial damage of the sandstone, the damage variable D of the ice-filled fractured sandstone during the loading process can be expressed as:
(3)
Coal-rock, as a typical heterogeneous material, contains a large number of randomly distributed micro-fractures, pores, and other defects. Assuming that coal-rock is composed of a large number of microcracks, these elements are sufficiently large in size to contain a large number of micro-defects in a spatial sense, but are sufficiently small in a mechanical sense to be regarded as a material point. The micro-pores and micro-cracks in rock during uniaxial compression can be considered to be randomly distributed. Based on statistical damage mechanics, it is assumed that rock damage is a continuous stress process, and the micro-damage of rock is described using the strength distribution of microcracks. This paper adopts the same microcracks strength distribution function as most existing studies, namely the Weibull distribution, whose probability density function is:
(4)
The relationship between the damage variable and the probability density function is:
(5)
The integral of Eq. (5) is obtained:
(6)
Then the damage variable expression can be expressed as:
(7)
According to Eq. (7), the damage variable D is affected by the microcracks strength F, and the microcracks strength is related to the state of stress of the rock. In order to reflect the influence of complex stress state on sandstone, it is considered that the failure criterion of microcracks conforms to Dsingle bondP failure criterion. The rock microcracks strength based on Dsingle bondP failure criterion is:
(8)
(9)
The ice-filled fractured sandstone is under uniaxial compression, and only the stress along one axis (assumed to be 
) is considered. Since 
 and 
 are typically zero or very small, 
 can be simplified. Therefore, Eq. (9) can be expressed as:
(10)
Substituting the Eq. (10) into the Eq. (8), the expression of the micro-unit strength is obtained, as follow:
(11)
By applying the strain equivalence hypothesis, the constitutive equation can be expressed as:
(12)
Substituting the damage variable D into Eq. (12), the expression of the strength-type statistical damage constitutive model of uniaxial ice-filled fractured sandstone under loading is:
(13)
The shape parameter m and the scale parameter S0 can be obtained by the peak stress method. When the stress-strain curve reaches the peak point, the slope of the curve is 0.
(14)
(15)
The shape parameter m and scale parameter S0 can be determined by combining Eq. (14) and Eq. (15).
(16)
The parameters involved in the above formulas are explained in Table 3.

4.2. Verification of damage constitutive equation
The peak stress
, peak strain 
, and elastic modulus E of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture angles were substituted into Eq. (16) to obtain the shape parameter m and scale parameter S0 based on the Weibull distribution during the damage process of sandstone with different ice-filled fracture angles. The results are shown in Table 4.

(16), the estimated values of axial stress for ice-filled fractured sandstone specimens at different strain stages were calculated and compared with the experimental values, as shown in Table 5. Based on the data in the table, Fig. 19 was plotted. From the figure, it can be observed that the errors between the estimated values calculated from the damage evolution model and the experimental values for sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fractured angles at various strain stages range from 0.56 % to 8.23 %. This indicates that the constructed damage evolution equation can accurately reflect the stress-strain relationship of sandstone with different ice-filled fracture angles.

Based on the data in the table, Fig. 20 was plotted. From the figure, it can be observed that the errors between the estimated values calculated from the damage evolution model and the experimental values for sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture lengths at various strain stages range from 0.11 % to 9.77 %. This indicates that the constructed damage evolution equation can accurately reflect the stress-strain relationship of sandstone with different ice-filled fracture configurations.

5. Multi-scale analysis of instability failure mechanism of ice-filled fractured sandstone
As a heterogeneous material, sandstone is composed of mineral particles and cements with varying sizes and strengths. The rock mass also contains primary pores, fractures, moisture, and air. Under low-temperature conditions, ice-filled fractured sandstone exhibits microscopic characteristics such as shrinkage of the mineral particle framework and pores, as well as freezing of moisture in pores and fractures into ice. These phenomena lead to a decrease in porosity and a denser internal structure of the rock, as shown in Fig. 21.

Fig. 21. The effect of freezing on the failure process of ice-filled fractured sandstone.

Microscopic scale: Ice particles are distributed in the prefabricated fractures and mineral matrix of sandstone. When the ice in the fractures expands or melts, moisture migration and changes in pore pressure directly alter the contact forces between mineral particles and the cementation strength. This microscopic mechanical effect first induces initial damage: the weakened cementation between particles generates micropores, and local stress concentration around the pores further triggers the detachment of small particles or the initiation of microcracks. These microscopic damages can be intuitively captured by acoustic emission signals with high-frequency and low-energy correspond exactly to such small-scale particle-level damages. These scattered microscopic damages provide the necessary initial conditions for the incubation and development of subsequent mesoscopic cracks.
Mesoscopic scale: Mesoscopic cracking is dominated by the ice-rock interface interaction and the mechanical properties of fractured ice. Temperature-driven water-ice phase transition induces stress redistribution within fractures, while the shear force generated by ice freezing and thawing acts on the ice-rock interface. When the interface strength is insufficient, slip or local damage occurs, which is a direct manifestation of the transformation from microscopic damage to mesoscopic cracking. As the load increases, prefabricated fractures propagate under the action of ice wedging, and microscopic cracks connect along the interface. Ice-filled fractures initially play a shear-resistant role; however, after sustained loading, the ice is crushed and detached from the interface, leading to accelerated propagation of mesoscopic cracks. At this stage, AE signals transition from high-frequency and low-energy to low-frequency and high-energy, marking the formation of continuous mesoscopic cracks and completing the damage evolution from the microscopic to mesoscopic scale.
Macroscopic scale: Test results indicate that the failure mode of specimens varies with the ice-filled fracture angle, and this phenomenon is essentially a macroscopic reflection of the cumulative effect of mesoscopic cracking (Wang et al., 2022). The stress transmitted by ice and the anti-slip friction effect of the ice-rock interface directly affect the direction and rate of mesoscopic crack propagation. When the ice-filled fracture angle is large, mesoscopic cracks tend to propagate directionally along the fracture surface, eventually converging to form macroscopic slip failure. The obvious softening stage exhibited by the rock stress-strain curve is precisely the macroscopic mechanical response to the continuous loss of bearing capacity caused by the full penetration of mesoscopic cracks. As shown in Fig. 22, the entire macroscopic failure process is not sudden but an inevitable result of the continuous initiation of microscopic damage and the sustained accumulation of mesoscopic cracking, fully demonstrating the multi-scale progressive instability law.

Fig. 22. Instability failure process of ice-filled fractured sandstone.

The unstable failure of ice-filled fractured sandstone follows the developmental law of “microscopic damage - mesoscopic cracking - macroscopic failure”. At the microscopic scale, the weakening of particle cementation and the initiation of microcracks provide initial conditions for the instability process. At the mesoscopic scale, the damage of the ice-rock interface and the connection of cracks promote the amplification and transmission of damage signals. The continuous accumulation of mesoscopic cracking ultimately exceeds the rock's bearing capacity, triggering overall failure at the macroscopic scale.
6. Discussion
This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the instability mechanisms of ice-filled fractured sandstone, addressing a challenge in rock slope engineering where complex fracture networks with varying lengths and orientations are ubiquitously present and susceptible to both anthropogenic activities and natural weathering processes. Through an integrated experimental and numerical approach, we systematically characterize the mechanical behavior of sandstone containing ice-filled fractures with controlled geometric parameter. While previous studies have explored the strength characteristics of fractured rocks under low temperatures, several key aspects remain insufficiently addressed. Building on the experimental and numerical results presented earlier, this section will discuss the following aspects:
6.1. Discussion on the negligibility of frost heaving force induced by water-ice phase transition
The volume expansion of ice exerts a significant internal pressure on the fracture walls before the application of external loads, which is called frost heaving force. This part of the frost heaving force can be neglected based on the following considerations:
1)
The specimens used in this study are ice-filled through-fracture samples, not those with full-scale freezing inside the rock mass. The fracture is only a single artificial prefabricated through-fracture with a width of merely 4 mm, while the overall dimensions of the specimen are 50 mm in diameter×100 mm in height. The fracture accounts for less than 3 % of the specimen volume, and ice only fills the narrow fracture rather than causing full-scale frost heaving inside the rock matrix.
2)
Referring to the results of previous frost heaving force tests on sandstone (Bai, 2019), under the constant temperature (−20 °C) condition adopted in this study, the frost heaving force generated by ice in fractured sandstone is basically maintained between 0.1–0.5 MPa. However, the peak uniaxial external load applied in this test can reach 20–70 MPa, and the frost heaving force only accounts for 0.14 % ∼ 2.5 % of the external load, showing a significant order-of-magnitude difference between the two.
3)
In cold-region engineering, the actual external loads borne by rock masses (such as the self-weight stress of subgrade slopes and the surrounding rock pressure of deep-buried tunnels) are usually above 10 MPa, and some deep engineering loads can even reach tens to hundreds of MPa, which is much larger than the magnitude of the frost heaving force of ice in fractures. Meanwhile, engineering rock masses are mostly complex systems with multiple fractures and multiphase media, so the impact of local frost heaving force from a single fracture on the overall stress state is further weakened.
Based on the comprehensive consideration of multiple factors including the specimen structure, the order-of-magnitude difference in forces, and engineering practice mentioned above, the frost heaving force generated by water-ice phase transition during the prefabrication of ice-filled fractures in this study has a negligible impact on the initial stress state and overall mechanical strength of the specimens.
6.2. Discussion on the modified Drucker-Prager criterion under uniaxial compression conditions: rationale, applicability, and prospects
The uniaxial compression condition was selected for the tests in this study based on the following two considerations:
1)
The mechanical behavior of ice-filled fractured rock masses is simultaneously influenced by multiple factors such as fracture geometric characteristics, ice-rock interface interaction, and low-temperature frost heaving. The uniaxial condition can first eliminate the interference of confining pressure, focusing on the influence of “fracture angle/length-ice-filled state” on the rock mass damage evolution law, thereby laying a foundation for subsequent research on complex working conditions.
2)
The stress state of rock masses in engineering scenarios such as the surface layer of shallow subgrade slopes and the excavation free face of tunnels in cold regions is closer to uniaxial compression. The conclusions under the uniaxial condition have direct reference value for such scenarios.
However, for the modified Drucker-Prager (Dsingle bondP) criterion based on uniaxial conditions in this paper, the specimen strength is not only affected by the angle and length of ice-filled fractures but also related to factors such as the location and number of ice-filled fractures. As you pointed out, actual rock masses in cold regions are mostly in a triaxial stress environment. When the modified Dsingle bondP criterion under uniaxial conditions is applied to triaxial working conditions, its effectiveness may decrease. This is because each parameter in the modified Dsingle bondP strength criterion is strongly correlated with the test conditions, and the uniaxial condition does not consider the constraint effect of confining pressure on the ice-rock interface strength and fracture propagation mode. If directly applied to deep rock mass engineering with high confining pressure, the prediction error will increase significantly.
However, incorporating numerous factors such as the thickness, inclination angle of ice-filled fractures, and confining pressure into the modification of the Dsingle bondP criterion is particularly complex and challenging, which requires gradual improvement in subsequent research. Building on the model framework of this paper, we will conduct triaxial compression tests on ice-filled fractured rock masses, quantify the coupling effect of “confining pressure-freeze-thaw cycles-fracture geometric characteristics”, and modify confining pressure-related parameters to enhance the model's applicability.
It is worth affirming that the idea and method of modifying the Dsingle bondP strength criterion in this paper are scientifically reasonable. They have good guiding significance for the strength estimation of engineering rock masses with similar test conditions to this study, and also high reference value for the modification of strength criteria under other influencing factors. This is exactly the innovation and value of this paper.
6.3. Prospects for freeze-thaw-mechanical coupling research on ice-filled fractured rock masses in cold-region engineering
Ice-filled fractured rock masses in cold-region engineering such as tunnel surrounding rocks and subgrade slopes are subjected to long-term natural periodic freeze-thaw cycles. The ice phase transition and moisture migration induced by alternating freeze-thaw continuously aggravate fracture propagation and rock mass damage, which is significantly different from the constant low-temperature condition adopted in this study. Currently, this research only conducts experiments under constant low-temperature conditions and does not consider the environmental factor of alternating freeze-thaw in practical engineering. This is a key direction that needs to be focused on and broken through in our subsequent research.
1)
We will simulate the actual freeze-thaw working conditions in cold regions and carry out freeze-thaw-mechanical coupling tests on ice-filled fractured rock masses. The focus will be on analyzing the fracture propagation law and the strength attenuation law of the ice-rock interface under different freeze-thaw cycles, and quantifying the correlation between freeze-thaw damage and mechanical property degradation.
2)
On the basis of the existing parameters such as fracture angle and length, we will further introduce geometric parameters including fracture density and porosity, and modify the freeze-thaw damage evolution equation in the constitutive model by combining experimental data.
3)
Combined with the on-site monitoring data of typical cold-region projects, we will reveal the intrinsic connection between water-ice phase transition and crack propagation through numerical simulation, link the laboratory test results with actual on-site working conditions, and ultimately establish a technical framework that can directly support the long-term stability assessment of ice-filled fractured rock mass engineering in cold regions.
7. Conclusion
1)
As the angle of ice-filled fractures increases, the compressive strength, elastic modulus, and pre-peak strain energy of the specimens first decrease and then increase, reaching their minimum values at θ = 45°. The parameter curves exhibit an approximate “V” shape with respect to the angle. The rock burst proneness of the sample decreases first and then increases with the increase of the ice-filled fracture angle, and the minimum value appears at θ = 45°. As the length of ice-filled fractures increases, the compressive strength, elastic modulus, and pre-peak strain energy of the specimens gradually decrease. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of fracture length on the mechanical properties is more pronounced for specimens with smaller fracture angles. The rock burst proneness of the specimen decreases linearly with the increase of the length of the ice-filled fracture.
2)
The deformation and failure process of the specimens can be divided into the micro-crack compaction stage, stable micro-crack development stage, unstable micro-crack development stage, and failure stage. The cumulative acoustic emission ring-down counts show a step-like increase during the unstable micro-crack development stage.
3)
The specimens exhibit a tensile-shear mixed failure mode under stress. As the angle of ice-filled fractures increases, the RA/AF value first increases and then decreases, reaching its maximum at a fracture angle of θ = 75°, where tensile failure accounts for the largest proportion among all specimens. As the length of ice-filled fractures increases, the RA/AF value gradually decreases, and the failure mode is predominantly tensile. However, with increasing fracture angle or length, the decrease in RA/AF becomes smaller, and the proportion of tensile failure decreases.
4)
The final failure of the specimens is primarily caused by wing cracks or the combined action of wing cracks and secondary cracks. As the angle of ice-filled fractures increases, the width of wing cracks gradually increases, and the degree of specimen damage becomes more severe. Sand spalling occurs in specimens with θ ≥ 75°. As the length of ice-filled fractures increases, the crack width gradually increases, and cracks originate from the tips of the ice-filled fractures. Sand spalling occurs in specimens with l ≥ 15 mm. Specimens in the 60° length group consistently produce only three wing cracks.
5)
Based on statistical distribution theory and the Dsingle bondP strength criterion, a damage constitutive equation was constructed for sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fractures, and its rationality was validated. The validation errors for the damage constitutive equation of sandstone specimens with different ice-filled fracture angles range from 0.56 % to 8.23 %, while for specimens with different ice-filled fracture lengths, the errors range from 0.11 % to 9.77 %. The accuracy of the damage constitutive equation calculations exceeds 90 %, accurately reflecting the stress-strain relationship of ice-filled fractured sandstone.
6)
A multi-scale analysis from “microscopic-mesoscopic-macroscopic” perspectives was conducted to investigate the instability and failure mechanisms of fractured sandstone under water-ice phase transition conditions. At the microscopic level, mineral particles within the rock undergo processes such as dissolution, micro-fracturing, macro-fracturing, and complete fracturing. These microscopic changes further lead to the initiation, propagation, and interconnection of cracks at the mesoscopic level, ultimately forming visible fractures and fractures at the macroscopic level, resulting in the instability and failure of ice-filled fractured sandstone. This process is essentially the result of cumulative rock damage under water-ice phase transition.
