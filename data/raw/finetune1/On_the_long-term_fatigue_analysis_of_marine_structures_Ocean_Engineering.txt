1. Introduction
A key aspect in the design of any offshore structure is fatigue assessment, which is a difficult practical problem to be solved, although crucial to the development of safe design. These structures are exposed to time-varying load effects induced by environmental actions caused by waves, wind, and ocean currents. In a more general mathematical definition, the fatigue assessment seeks to solve the following integral:
(1)
where 
 is fatigue damage accumulated over a long-term period, e.g., 1-year, 
 is the total number of short-term conditions occurring in the considered long-term period (e.g., considering the short-term period as 3-h and the long-term period as one year, 
), 
 is the short-term fatigue damage, i.e., the total fatigue damage accumulated in the short-term period with a defined set of environmental parameters 
, 
 is the number of short-term environmental parameters in 
, and 
 is the joint probability density representing the statistical behavior of all environmental parameters in the long-term. The environmental parameters 
 are represented by the short-term linear 
 and angular 
 parameters of the environmental actions. The linear parameters 
 may include the significant height 
 and peak period 
 of wind-sea and swell waves, mean wind velocity 
 and surface current velocity 
. The angular parameters 
 include incidence direction of the waves, wind and current during the short-term conditions. However, some environmental models can adopt simplifications, such as the characterization of the short-term wind velocities and the incidence directions associated to the short-term parameters of the wind-sea wave or the implementation of a reduced number of current profiles.
In most of the practical design applications, except those concerning vortex induced vibrations (VIV), the current effect is not the main input parameter and may even not be considered for the fatigue assessment. Moreover, in most of the practical designs of structures used for oil production, only the wave-induced fatigue damage matters (for instance, for each short-term condition, a characteristic wind velocity is associated to the given value of 
), which can be useful to identify some crucial responses, such as maximum stresses, critical Transfer Functions (Response Amplitude Operators or Quadratic Transfer Functions) and critical internal fluids in production risers. For FOWT (Floating Offshore Wind Turbines), besides the waves, the wind plays an important role in fatigue assessment of such structures.
It is important to mention that any evaluation of the short-term fatigue damage 
 requires a numerical simulation of the structure in order to assess the dynamic stresses in that condition. Depending on the situation, the required structural analysis can be either in frequency-domain (linear wave-stress behavior) or in time-domain (nonlinear wave-stress behavior). The vast majority of real marine structures, e.g., risers used by oil industry, FOWTs and floating oil production units mooring lines and other FOWTs structural components, require short-term nonlinear stochastic time domain analyses due to their inherently nonlinear behavior. It is remarkable that usually any of these time-domain analyses require a very large computational time for its execution. Once stresses are available, spectral methods (frequency-domain analysis) or Rainflow counting method (time-domain analysis) can be used associated with S–N curves and Miner’s linear damage accumulation rule to obtain the required short-term fatigue damage. In this sense, frequency and time-domain analyses are both accepted by international standards and classification societies.
The numerical solution of Eq. (1) is not easy for a few reasons. Firstly, it is itself a multidimensional integral in 
, i.e., an 
-dimensional integral. Secondly, as explained above, any discrete evaluation of its integrand may be very computationally demanding. Lastly, the behavior of its integrand can be very complex and depends heavily on the dynamic properties (natural frequency, damping, etc.) of the structure under consideration. It is also noted that this equation must be evaluated for all fatigue hotspots of the structure under analysis.
Over time, many procedures have been used or proposed to solve accurately and efficiently Eq. (1). The most well-known procedure is the use of wave scatter diagrams. In this procedure, only a single wave (no sea and swell representation) is considered, and the data is separated by the wave incidence directions. For any wave incidence direction, a bi-dimensional histogram is constructed for 
 and 
 from the environmental data available. Then, the long-term fatigue damage is estimated by:
(2)
where 
 is the number of sectors of wave incidence directions, 
 and 
 is the number of the divisions employed in the wave scatter diagram for 
 and 
, respectively, 
 is the short-term fatigue damage computed when 
, 
 and the wave incidence direction is 
, 
 is the corresponding frequency of occurrence of this condition, 
 and 
 are the center values of the bin representing the 
 interval of 
 and 
 interval of 
 and 
 is the frequency of occurrence of waves of incidence direction 
. In fact, this problem belongs to the 
 and the total number of structural analyses required for its solution is 
. This figure heavily depends on the numbers of intervals used in the discretization. A finer mesh requires many more analyses than a less refined one. A point must be mentioned when this approach is intended to be used for problems where more environmental parameters are considered in the analysis. Indeed, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. For instance, when wind-sea and swell waves are modelled independently so that 
, the number of numerical simulations required grows proportional to 
. The curse of dimensionality is something that comes along with any standard quadrature technique, like Gauss-Legendre or Gauss-Hermite quadrature, when used to solve Eq. (1).
Trying to improve the computational efficiency in the fatigue analysis of marine structures, lately many attempts have been proposed in literature. Low and Cheung (2012) proposed the Perturbation method and the Asymptotic Approximation method to effectively assess the multi-dimensional long-term fatigue integral. Both techniques consider the Taylor’s series expansion of the short-term fatigue damage about a point 
 and 
. This expansion point is at the mean values of the environmental variables, i.e., 
 and 
 in the Perturbation Method, whereas in the Asymptotic Approximation method the expansion point is at the 
 domain location for which the integrand of Eq. (1) reaches its maximum value. These methods require the numerical assessment of the short-term fatigue damage high-order derivatives, which may be challenging to evaluate correctly. The accuracy of the Perturbation method is difficult to be estimated and depends on the problem at hand so that it lacks a procedure to be evaluated in advance. However, its main advantage is that its expansion point is the same for all hotspots along the structure where fatigue damage is assessed. In other words, the same numerical simulations of the structure are used for all hotspots considered (Low, 2016). For the Asymptotic Approximation method, the expansion point is identified through the solution of an optimization problem that requires additional numerical simulations. In this sense, the major hurdle of this approach is that the optimum point can be distinct from one hotspot to another in a marine structure. Thus, different numerical structural simulations are required for multiple locations of the structure, which may impair the efficiency of the method. Nonetheless, this approach is fairly accurate for the assessment of the long-term fatigue damage when compared to the Perturbation method (Low and Cheung, 2012; Low, 2016). Adaptive standard numerical integration methods, like Romberg’s method (Romberg, 1955), could suffer from similar drawback for the problem at hand.
Monsalve-Giraldo et al. (2016) proposed the use of the Univariate Dimension-Reduction Method (UDRM) to efficiently solve the long-term fatigue damage integral (Eq. (1)) associated with steel risers design considering single waves. This method was originally developed by Rahman and Xu (2004) aiming to evaluate statistical moments of response of mechanical systems subject to uncertainties in geometry, material properties and loads. This method can perform a complete fatigue assessment with only a few short-term structural analyses, and it does not require the assessment of short-term fatigue damage numerical derivatives. However, UDRM lacks a practical method to estimate its error, which is the result of approximations of the short-term fatigue damage function inherent in such a method. This approach has also been used by Ibarra et al. (2022) to compute the fatigue damage of the mooring lines taking into account the modelling of wind-sea and swell waves as statistically independent and simultaneous phenomena.
Vaillant (2024) and Vaillant et al. (2024) proposed the use of higher order Dimension-Reduction methods for the effective fatigue assessment of tensile armors of flexible risers subjected to bimodal sea states, more specifically, the Bivariate Dimension-Reduction Method (BDRM) and the Trivariate Dimension-Reduction Method (TDRM) were used. Both methods were initially developed to be applied to stochastic mechanical problems aiming to reduce the residual error delivered by UDRM (Xu and Rahman, 2004; Ding and Xu, 2021; Xu and Zhou, 2020). These enhanced techniques will be later discussed in this work.
A universal solution technique to solve Eq. (1) is the Monte Carlo Simulation method. This is a generic method, which also allows the evaluation of the integration error based on the number of simulations used to solve multidimensional integral. For the problem at hand, this approach calculates the long-term fatigue damage 
 using sampled data generated from 
. However, its original form, known as the Brute Force method, can become excessively computationally demanding as it calls for a significant amount of numerical simulations of the structure to assess 
. In this regard, researchers have studied some techniques that intend to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo Simulation method in the fatigue analyses of marine structures, e.g., Chen and Low (2021a) proposed the use of a technique, known as Control Variates, to speed up the fatigue assessment of some marine structures, including risers and mooring lines. Müller and Cheng (2018) proposed the use of a Quasi-Monte Carlo approach based on Sobol’s sequence to estimate the long-term fatigue damage of FOWT’s components. These and other Monte Carlo-based approaches will be described in detail later in this paper.
The main objective of this paper is to present a comparative study among some procedures available for the long-term fatigue damage of offshore structures focusing on problems of higher dimension (
). Besides the accuracy, the focus of the comparison is the computational efficiency of the methods, i.e., the number of numerical simulations of the structure required by each one. The comparison is restricted to procedures based on the availability of the joint probability distribution 
, which allow the fatigue damage of different hotspots to be assessed with the same structural numerical simulations. There are many other possibilities, but the paper addresses only some Direct integration approaches, Dimension-Reduction methods, and some Monte Carlo Simulation-based approaches. More focus is devoted to the last two classes of methods. Then, more specifically, this paper gives more attention to the following Dimension-Reduction approaches:
-
UDRM (Univariate Dimension-Reduction Method)
-
BDRM (Bivariate Dimension-Reduction Method)
-
TDRM (Trivariate Dimension-Reduction Method) and to the following Monte Carlo Simulation-based approaches:
-
Crude Monte Carlo Simulation
-
Monte Carlo Simulation with Control Variates
-
Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation using Sobol’s sequence.
This comparative study is based only on spectral fatigue analysis aiming to gain a deep comprehension of the problem. However, the findings can be applied to time-domain based approaches as well. All investigations are also restricted to a wave-induced fatigue problem that considers the simultaneous action of wind-sea and swell waves. To be able to go deeper and to make feasible comparisons, the problem is represented by an idealized linear stress transfer function whose parameters can be tuned to mimic many distinct dynamic behaviors of typical marine structures.
2. Wave-induced fatigue considering wind-sea and swell waves
This paper is focused on wave-induced fatigue assessment considering the modelling of waves as wind-sea and swell. Wind-sea and swell waves are considered as two statistically independent phenomena acting simultaneously on the structure. For practical purposes, the long-term period considered for the fatigue damage accumulation is one year and the short-term period is assumed to be 3-h. Besides, the incidence directions of wind-sea and swell waves are represented by discrete probability distributions where each discrete point represents an angular sector, such as: N, NE, E, etc. Under these assumptions, Eq. (1) is rewritten as:
(3)
where 2920 is the expected number of 3-h short-term sea states in one year; 
 and 
 are the number of discrete directions for wind-sea and swell waves, respectively; 
 is the accumulated fatigue damage in a short-term period associated to a sea state with a wind-sea wave (having 
 and 
) coming from the direction 
 acting simultaneously with a swell wave (having 
 and 
) coming from the direction 
; 
 and 
 are the 
 joint probability density distributions for the wind-sea and the swell waves, respectively; 
 is the frequency of simultaneous occurrence of a wind-sea wave coming from the direction 
 and a swell wave coming from the direction 
.
The discretization used for representing the angular variables leads to the need of computing many times a four-dimensional numerical integral to solve the full problem, which usually considers 8, 12 or 16 incidence directions. In this paper, a full problem is not directly solved. Thus, the goal is to comparatively evaluate approaches that can efficiently solve the four-dimensional long-term fatigue integral that appears in Eq. (3) because once it is properly solved the full problem can be easily solved too.
2.1. General description of case studies worked out
In this paper, only spectral fatigue analysis is considered by means of an idealized linear stress transfer function whose parameters can be tuned in to represent many distinct dynamic structural behaviors of marine structures. Moreover, without going further into wave-induced hydrodynamic forces, a simplified force model is also employed.
The idealized stress transfer function is represented generically by:
(4)
where 
 and 
 are arbitrary parameters satisfying 
, and 
, 
 or 
, is the simplified generic stress transfer function of a dynamic system with one degree of freedom (Clough and Penzien, 1995) given by:
(5)
where 
, 
 and 
 are the stress transforming constant for a linear system, the critical damping ratio and the corresponding natural frequency, respectively.
Although it is very simple, the transfer function 
 can be here used to mimic the behavior of, for instance, a mooring line where the very low translational natural frequency of the floater motion and the natural frequency of the line itself can be represented. In fact, many other situations can be mimicked. The main idea here is to have a simple model to be able to simulate many similar distinct stress response behaviors that can happen in practice. Obviously, real systems are much more complex than the simplification employed in this work since almost every time the nonlinear behavior prevails.
For a given short-term condition 
, the stress response spectrum can be ideally represented by:
(6)
where 
 is the spectral density of the environmental loading, which has been assumed to be a function of the sea elevation spectral density 
 and is simplified as:
(7)
where the indexes 1 and 2 are used to wind-sea and swell waves, respectively, 
 and 
 are simplified hydrodynamic force coefficients defined arbitrarily in this work. These coefficients would serve to relativize the intensity of hydrodynamic forces generated by both waves due to, for instance, their difference of incidence directions with respect to the floater. Also, in this paper, the modified Pierson-Moskovitz spectrum (Chakrabarti, 2005) has been used to represent the short-term sea elevation spectrum of both wind-sea and swell waves.
From the corresponding stress response spectrum, the corresponding spectral moments can be obtained by:
(8)
where 
.
Many spectral fatigue approaches are available to estimate the short-term fatigue damage from the stress spectral density. Still, in this work, all fatigue computations are based on the Dirlik’s method (Dirlik, 1985) that can be summarized as:
(9)
where 
 is the S–N curve parameter and the terms 
, 
, 
 and 
 depend solely on the information obtained through the stress spectrum moments (Eq. (8)) and on the S–N curve slope 
2.1.1. Environmental wave data
In this paper, as mentioned earlier, just one combination of wind-sea and swell waves has been considered. The joint probability of this combination is given by:
(10)
where for both wind-sea (
) or swell waves (
) the 
 joint probability distribution has been modelled as:
(11)
For both wind-sea and swell waves, the marginal probability density function of 
 has been represented by a 2-Parameter Weibull distribution, which is given by:
(12)
where 
 and 
 for the wind-sea wave and 
 and 
 for the swell wave.
In addition, the probability density function of 
 conditioned on values of 
 has been represented by a conditional lognormal distribution for both wind-sea and swell waves, that reads:
(13)
where 
 and 
 are the parameters dependent on 
 for the wind-sea wave and 
 and 
 are the parameters dependent on 
 for the swell wave, parameterized as:
(14)
whose parameters are 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
 and 
.
The joint probability distributions presented in Fig. A.1 represent the typical behavior of the waves in locations from the Brazilian offshore region.
2.1.2. Probability-space transformation
Most of the efficient approaches for the long-term fatigue damage assessment investigated in this work are performed in an integration domain where the random variables are statistically independent. In other words, the approaches require that the dependent physical variables 
 and 
 (for both wind-sea and swell waves) must be transformed in equivalent statistically independent ones. This can be achieved by means of the Rosenblatt Transformation (Rosenblatt, 1952):
(15)
where 
, 
, 
 and 
 are the cumulative probability distributions associated to the probability density functions 
, 
, 
 and 
, respectively, and 
, 
, 
 and 
 are cumulative probability distributions of the independent arbitrary random variables 
. In the case that all random variables 
 are taken as standard Gaussian random variables, the following relationships are obtained:
(16)
where 
 is the cumulative probability distribution function of a standard Gaussian random variable and 
 stands for its inverse.
In a similar way, when all random variables 
 are defined as uniform random variables in the interval 
, the following relationships are obtained:
(17)
Eqs. (16), (17) give the corresponding values of the random variables 
 for a given set of physical variables 
. However, the inverses of these transformations are easily attainable and are not shown here.
By transforming all physical variables into the space of standard Gaussian random variables, the four-dimensional integral of Eq. (3) (omitting the indexes 
 and 
) is now given by:
(18)
where 
 is the short-term fatigue damage generated by the environmental parameters 
 in the original space associated to 
 in the reduced space, i.e.,
(19)
and 
 is the probability density function of a standard Gaussian random variable, which is defined as:
(20)
Similarly, when transforming all physical variables into the space of uniform random variables defined within the 
 interval, the integral from Eq. (3) is rewritten as:
(21)
3. Integration methods
The goal of the paper is to investigate the efficiency of some general-use methods to solve the long-term fatigue integral. In this work, they have been classified into three categories: Direct numerical integration methods, Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods, and Dimension-Reduction methods.
3.1. Direct numerical integration methods
There is a sort of approaches available in literature to solve the long-term fatigue integral. As stated previously, the approaches that work iteratively have not been considered. Among the Direct numerical integration methods, a Brute Force numerical integration and a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based technique have been considered. Both procedures work in the space of the independent Gaussian variables.
3.1.1. Gauss-Hermite Quadrature
The Gauss-Hermite quadrature integration (GHQ) (see Abramowitz and Stegun (1972)) is an appropriate numerical technique that solves improper integrals, by a finite sum, for instance:
(22)
where 
 are the coordinates, 
 are the weights associated to each integration point and 
 is the number of integration points. Also, values of 
 and 
 can be found in typical mathematical books, for example, Abramowitz and Stegun (1972).
Considering the problem at hand, the long-term fatigue integral can be calculated using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature technique, for a given value of 
, as:
(23)
Thus, the long-term fatigue integral is calculated by employing 
 integration points.
As shown by Ibarra (2022), the Gauss-Hermite quadrature integration leads to good results employing 
 and reaches stability at 
. Based on these considerations, three values of Gauss-Hermite integration points 
 will be investigated in this work, i.e., 
, 
 and 
.
Table 1 presents the total number of structural numerical simulations required to evaluate the long-term fatigue damage (Eq. (18)) of an offshore structure subjected to a single combination of wind-sea and swell waves using this numerical technique.

3.1.2. Brute Force Numerical Integration
This technique consists in using an integration uniform mesh where each integration axis is divided in 
 equidistant points. The distance between points is given by:
(24)
where 
 and 
 have been defined in this work as 
 and 
, respectively. The coordinate of each point is given by (
):
(25)
Then, the integral result can be obtained as:
(26)
The main drawback of the Brute Force method (BFM) lies in the high computational burden required to perform all structural simulations considering every short-term environmental condition stemming from the discretization process. For instance, if 
 (typical values of number of divisions used for 
 and 
 scatter diagrams), assessing the result of the long-term fatigue damage integral would involve approximately 
 (hundreds of thousands; the curse of dimensionality) short-term structural simulations for just a single combination of wind-sea and swell waves. Consequently, this technique might not be recommended for practical design purposes due to the prohibitive number of numerical simulations required. However, sometimes it may be used just once to generate the result that shall be benchmarked by any other more efficient approach under investigation.
3.2. Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods
Monte Carlo Simulation is a standard technique, which is used to solve integrals involving probability distributions and so on. Moreover, it offers means for checking the obtained result. The conventional or the so-called Brute Monte Carlo Simulation is asymptotically convergent, however, its convergence rate is usually slow. Because of this, many other alternative procedures have been proposed to improve its efficiency. In this work, the following Monte Carlo Simulation-based procedures have been investigated to solve the long-term fatigue integral, namely: Crude Monte Carlo Simulation, Monte Carlo Simulation with Control Variates and Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation using Sobol’s sequence.
3.2.1. Crude Monte Carlo Simulation
In statistical terms, the integral found in Eq. (3) represents the expected value of the short-term fatigue damage function. Therefore, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) can be a suitable method to estimate it (Low and Cheung, 2012; Low, 2016; Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b). In order to illustrate this concept, consider a function 
 of a random vector 
 in which 
. The expected value of 
 is given by:
(27)
where 
 is the joint probability density function of 
. In case there are 
 random samples 
, where 
, an unbiased estimator for 
 is obtained as follows (Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b):
(28)
This approach can be used to assess the multidimensional integral of Eq. (3). Considering the short-term fatigue damage function 
 and environmental parameters 
, the expected value 
 for the short-term condition 
 is given by:
(29)
where 
 is the joint probability density function of 
; 
 is the 
 th set of environmental condition parameters randomly generated from 
; and 
 is the sample size (number of sets). The coefficient of variation 
 of 
 is estimated from the 
 samples, i.e.,
(30)
where 
 is the estimated standard deviation of the short-term damage samples 
, which can be calculated as:
(31)
This procedure can be implemented using the reduced space variables where 
 random samples 
 are drawn from four statistically independent standard Gaussian variables, which represents the joint probability density distribution (
). Afterwards, 
 samples are estimated and 
 and 
 are obtained. The accuracy of the estimate can be iteratively controlled based on the number of simulations. Thus, the coefficient of variation is continuously updated as 
 increases until 
 achieves an acceptable tolerance limit 
, i.e., 
.
The main advantage of Monte Carlo Simulation method is that 
 does not depend on the integral dimension and can therefore be employed in higher-dimensional problems. In contrast, its greatest downside relates to its slow convergence rate, which is inversely proportional to 
 (Low, 2016).
Typically, large values of 
 are required to achieve the desired 
. Hence, while this method is considered simple, it often leads to high computational cost. This motivates the urgent demand for techniques that improve Monte Carlo Simulation method’s efficiency.
3.2.2. Monte Carlo Simulation with Control Variates
Control Variates (CV) is a classical variance reduction technique used to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation method for assessing the expected value 
 (Low, 2016; Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b). Firstly, a control function 
 is introduced and its expected value 
 is estimated. Next, a new unbiased estimator 
 is defined as follows:
(32)
where 
 is the control weight.
It can be shown that 
 and the variance of 
 is (Low, 2016; Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b):
(33)
where 
 and 
 stand for the variance and the covariance, respectively.
As seen in the previous section, an important aspect of Monte Carlo Simulation is that the number of simulations required to estimate the expected value of a random variable is proportional to its variance. If 
 is lower than 
, it is useful to estimate 
 through 
. Therefore, the Control Variates method defines a control weight 
 that minimizes 
. The optimal value of 
 is given by (Low, 2016; Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b):
(34)
The minimized variance of 
 is obtained substituting Eq. (34) into Eq. (33), i.e.,
(35)
where 
 is the correlation coefficient between 
 and 
.
Eq. (35) shows that 
 decreases when 
 increases. This implies that the effectiveness of Control Variates method relies on how strongly correlated 
 and 
 are. Thus, this procedure aims at choosing a control function 
 which is greatly correlated with 
 in order to attain the largest variance reduction possible (Low, 2016; Chen and Low, 2021a, 2021b).
This method has some advantages over other variance reduction methods. In the worst-case scenario, i.e., when both 
 and 
 are uncorrelated, 
 remains unchanged. This results in zero variance reduction, which means this method is considered safe as it does not decrease the efficiency of the classical Monte Carlo Simulation method regardless of the selected control function. This technique has already been used by Chen and Low (2021a, 2021b) in the assessment of long-term fatigue damage of marine structures.
It is possible to choose control functions defined either in the original or in the reduced space, since the aforementioned assumptions and principles of this method are valid to evaluate fatigue damage in both spaces. Also, it must be noticed that the control function does not intend to be an approximation for 
, which is represented here by the short-term fatigue damage function, but it is pivotal that both are heavily correlated. In this work, different control functions are investigated.
It is noteworthy that once the control function has been defined, the accuracy of the simulation results can be checked through the same equations defined previously for Crude Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).
3.2.2.1. Control function in the reduced standard Gaussian space
Two different control functions defined in the reduced space of the standard Gaussian variables have been investigated, namely a fourth-order polynomial function (CVN) and a Kriging metamodel-based function (CVK), which will be described next.
3.2.2.1.1. Fourth-order polynomial function (CVN)
Considering four independent standard Gaussian random variables (
), after trying other polynomial options, a complete fourth-order (quartic) polynomial control function 
 was chosen. It is defined as:
(36)
where 
 is the associated short-term set in the reduced space, 
 is the vector of parameters of the control function to be defined, 
 are the auxiliary functions and 
 is the number of terms included in the selected control function.
In this work, the parameters from vector 
 are assessed each time the 
 of the estimator of the long-term fatigue damage is evaluated. In other words, after randomly generating 
 sample sets 
 from four independent standard Gaussian distributions, the parameters 
 of the control function are calculated through the solution of a standard linear regression procedure, which are continuously updated as the number of samples are increased.
3.2.2.1.2. Kriging metamodel (CVK)
The Kriging method is a metamodeling technique that has been implemented to work as a surrogate model in many engineering applications (Wang et al., 2014).
The main objective of the Kriging method is to predict values of a given random function 
 with minimal error at any location of the domain based on 
 available sample points 
. The deterministic response is considered a stochastic process, which is the unknown function of interest 
. It can be split into two terms, i.e.,
(37)
where 
 is a known polynomial function and 
 is the realization of a stationary Gaussian random process (Lichtenstern, 2013). In fact, 
 is also called the regression model (overall trend of the design space) and 
 represents the surface local deviations from the polynomial so that the Kriging metamodel interpolates the 
 sampled data points (Wang et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 2001a; Simpson et al., 2001b).
In this work, the unknown function is denoted by 
 and it represents the short-term fatigue damage in the reduced space. Hence, each sea state can be represented by a four-variable set 
. Considering a set of 
 sea states 
 where each combination of wind-sea and swell waves is given by 
, the covariance matrix of 
 is assumed as follows:
(38)
where 
 is the variance of the random process, 
 is the 
 x 
 symmetric correlation matrix and 
 is the correlation function between any two sea states 
 and 
 (Wang et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 2001a; Simpson et al., 2001b).
In addition, the regression model 
 must be defined to develop the Kriging metamodel. In many cases, 
 is considered a constant term (Simpson et al., 1998, 2001a, 2001b; Koehler and Owen, 1996; Sacks et al., 1989), but it can also be taken as a linear combination of 
 basic functions as follows (Lichtenstern, 2013):
(39)
where 
 and 
 are considered the regression parameters. As explained above regarding 
, the same set of 
 sampled sea states 
 are considered in the computation of 
. Here, 
 is defined as follows:
(40)
Considering a new untried sea state 
 for which fatigue damage assessment is aimed, an unbiased estimator of the response 
 is given by:
(41)
where 
 is the correlation vector of length 
 between the sea state 
 and the sea states of the sample set 
 and 
 is the short-term fatigue damage response vector of length 
, i.e., 
 (Wang et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 2001a; Simpson et al., 2001b).
It can be shown that the regression model 
 has a generalized least squares solution (Wang et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 2001a; Simpson et al., 2001b), which presents 
 and 
 as functions of 
. Thus, Eq. (41) is also a function of 
. The 
 unknown correlation parameters must be estimated through the solution of a 
-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem to find the best Kriging model (Simpson et al., 1998, 2001a, 2001b). After the assessment of the optimal 
 vector (
), Eq. (41) can be rewritten, and the optimal response may be obtained as follows:
(42)
In this work, the following procedure is carried out to estimate the optimal correlation parameters 
 and further construct the Kriging interpolation function. Two sets of sample data points are generated from four uniformly distributed independent random variables 
 in which 
 samples 
 are generated for the training set and 
 samples 
 are generated for the validation set so that 
 and 
. Then, the associated short-term fatigue damage responses are calculated for the training and validation sets, i.e., 
 and 
, respectively. The regression matrix 
 is obtained applying the training set 
 samples to Eq. (40). Also, 
 and 
 are defined as functions of 
 and 
 is the short-term fatigue damage response vector represented by the 
 samples 
.
The last step is the solution of the optimization problem previously mentioned as this is a mandatory stage of the correct construction of the Kriging interpolation function. In this work, it consists in the definition of the mean squared error function as follows:
(43)
where 
 is the validation set sample size. The estimation of the optimal correlation parameters 
 is performed through minimizing Eq. (43) where the restriction 
 applies. Ultimately, after the assessment of 
, the Kriging interpolation function is given by Eq. (42), which is employed as a control function in the Control Variates method. However, it must be noted that this minimizing process can be time-consuming.
3.2.2.2. Control function in the original space (CVO)
In this paper, a control function defined in the original space (CVO), i.e., 
, is also considered. Low (2016) suggests that the definition of any control function is more effective if it particularly suits the problem at hand. In this way, some important characteristics concerning a single-wave sea state should be highlighted. First, the short-term fatigue damage 
 is wave period 
 sensitive, which is a consequence of factors such as, for instance, system resonances, 
 influence in the number of stress cycles during a given time period and frequency dependent wave loads. Second, 
 increases exponentially with the wave height 
 for a fixed 
 (Low, 2016). In accordance with these notions, Low (2016) defines a control function model for a single-wave sea state with parameters 
 and 
, i.e.,
(44)
where 
 and 
 are parameters that depend on 
. According to Low (2016), 
 and 
 are respectively modelled as polynomials of 
 th and 
 th order that are given by:
(45)
Numerous polynomials could be developed inserting Eq. (45) into Eq. (44). In this way, Low (2016) presents four different models where 
 is always an even number since odd-ordered polynomials are less stable. After several analyses, Model 2 from Low (2016) is chosen as a control function model in this work, i.e.,
(46)
where 
 is a set of four parameters of the control function to be defined.
An adapted version of Eq. (46) is written for a bimodal sea state with parameters 
, 
, 
 and 
 to consider the combination of wind-sea and swell waves. The control function reads:
(47)
where 
 is the short-term environmental condition and 
 is the vector of seven parameters of the control function to be defined.
In this work, the parameters from vector 
 of Eq. (47) are estimated through the solution of a linear regression after a logarithmic transformation is applied to Eq. (47), which aims to maximize the coefficient of correlation 
 between the short-term fatigue damage function 
 and the control function 
 (see more details in Queiroz (2022)).
3.2.2.3. Implementation of Control Variates methods for fatigue assessment
After estimating the control function parameters, the associated control function values 
 as well as the short-term fatigue damage function values 
 for all random samples are simulated. From these two sets, the correlation 
 between 
 and 
 is assessed and the covariance of both sets is calculated as follows:
(48)
where 
 and 
 are, respectively, the standard deviations of the short-term fatigue damage and the control function sets. Then, the control weight 
 is calculated using Eq. (34), i.e.,
(49)
In order to use Eq. (32), the mean value of 
, i.e., 
 is also needed. This mean and the standard deviation 
 can be estimated from the samples available. However, as 
 is know analytically these quantities can be computed by numerical integration solving the two integrals bellow:
(50)
where 
. In the present work, both integrals have been solved by means of Gauss-Hermite quadrature using 9 integrations points, i.e., 
.
The procedure outlined above in this section holds regardless of which control function is considered. Then, the 
 th controlled output 
 of the short-term fatigue damage is given by:
(51)
Finally, the expected value 
 of short-term fatigue damage using the Control Variates method is estimated as follows:
(52)
and the coefficient of variation of this estimator can be assessed using Eq. (30).
It is important to stress that the parameters of the control functions are updated while more simulations are available for all methods described above, except the one that uses the Kriging metamodel. This method can be very computationally demanding if a very large number of samples are used to construct the Kriging interpolation function. Thus, only a small number of samples (
 is employed to initially define the parameters of the control function, which remains the same throughout the whole Control Variates procedure.
Anyway, the number of numerical simulations associated to any Monte Carlo Simulation-based approach is equal to the total number of samples needed to obtain a coefficient of variation 
 less than or equal to the threshold (
.
3.2.3. Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation (QMCS)
Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation (QMCS) methods are based on deterministic generation of sampling points instead of random ones. These approaches are usually based on the generation of sampling points in a 
 hyper-cube where each of its sizes is delimited in the interval [0,1]. The main idea behind these methods is to have a more uniform (less discrepant) distribution of the sampling points over this domain. Following the steps described by Müller and Cheng (2018), this work employs the so-called Sobol’s sequence for the sampling points generation. After the sampling points generation, the procedure follows the same steps as the Crude Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with the exception that the relationship between the physical space of the environmental variables and the reduced one is now driven by the transformation given by Eq. (17).
It is claimed in literature (Müller and Cheng, 2018) that the convergence rate of this procedure is of the order of 
, where 
 is the number of simulations (sampling points). However, to the authors' best knowledge, there is not an explicit equation to compute the estimated error directly. Hence, in this work, the accuracy of this approach for a given number of simulations 
 has been estimated by the coefficient of variation of the estimated fatigue damage computed from 20 distinct sequences, each one containing 
 samples.
3.3. Dimension-Reduction Methods (DRMs)
This class of methods has been developed (Rahman and Xu, 2004) aiming to solve stochastic integrals such as Eq. (1). In general, any Dimension-Reduction Method (DRM) uses a low-order Additive Decomposition to represent the function of interest in the stochastic integral, leading to the solution of lower order integrals that are considerably less burdensome than the original one.
The generalization of the DRMs is fully described in Xu and Rahman (2004). From now on, the description is particularized to the problem of solving the 
 integral described in Eq. (1). Then, this work specifically investigates the Univariate Dimension-Reduction method (UDRM), the Bivariate Dimension-Reduction method (BDRM) and the Trivariate Dimension-Reduction method (TDRM). However, it is important to mention that regarding the problem of long-term fatigue damage assessment, Monsalve-Giraldo et al. (2016) proposed the use of UDRM to efficiently evaluate the long-term fatigue damage of marine structures subjected to a single-wave sea state. Additionally, Ibarra et al. (2022) successfully applied UDRM to assess the long-term fatigue damage of mooring lines from the anchoring systems of FPSO-type units considering the effects of different combinations of wind-sea and swell waves.
The Additive Decompositions for the short-term fatigue damage function 
 by UDRM, BDRM and TDRM are, respectively, given by (Xu and Rahman, 2004; Vaillant, 2024; Vaillant et al., 2024):
(53)
Substituting Eq. (53) into Eq. (18) yields the expected short-term fatigue damage. For instance, the final equations for UDRM and BDRM are, respectively:
(54)
The integrals above must be solved in a discrete form since each integration point represents the assessment of one short-term fatigue damage. Hence, the Gauss-Hermite quadrature integration described in Section 3.1.1 with a given number of integration points 
 is employed. Each integration point of the numerical quadrature approach corresponds to a structural simulation, i.e., the assessment of the short-term fatigue damage associated to a short-term environmental condition. Additionally, if 
 is an odd number, the zeros coordinates in the reduced space are common to some numerical integrals that must be evaluated, since the Gauss-Hermite quadrature nodes are symmetrical. This decreases the number of integration points that are considered. Therefore, the total number of structural numerical analyses required to calculate the long-term fatigue damage considering wind-sea and swell waves using UDRM, BDRM and TDRM is given respectively by (Ding and Xu, 2021; Xu and Zhou, 2020; Vaillant, 2024; Vaillant et al., 2024):
(55)
From Eq. (55), it is seen that the number of points grows linearly, quadratically, and cubically with the order of the reduction for UDRM, BDRM and TDRM, respectively. As mentioned in Section 3.1.1., different number of points can be adopted when using Gauss-Hermite quadrature, i.e., 
, 
 and 
. Table 2 presents the total number of structural numerical analyses necessary to assess the long-term fatigue damage for a given combination of wind-sea and swell waves considering different values of 
.

Finally, it is important to mention that a relevant drawback of the Dimension-Reduction Methods (DRMs) is that they do not have a manner to control or measure their accuracy. Then, this topic must be assessed through numerical tests for the structure of interest. More specific details on the application of DRMs in the fatigue assessment of marine structures can be found in Vaillant (2024) and Vaillant et al. (2024).
4. Case studies investigated
In this section, two comprehensive examples of fatigue damage assessment are presented to investigate the performance of the methods previously described. Both cases are particular examples of the general problem described in Section 2.
4.1. Example 1: unimodal transfer function
This example investigates an idealized theoretical case to estimate the long-term fatigue damage where only the transfer function 
 is considered in Eq. (4), i.e., 
 and 
. The system parameters 
 and 
 are assumed to be equal to 0.25 and 0.1, respectively. In order to investigate the sensitivity of the numerical approaches for long-term fatigue assessment, 11 different values (as shown in Table 3) for the system natural frequency 
 have been considered. The transfer function for 
 rad/s is shown in Fig. 1.

The corresponding parameters associated to each wave spectrum required to define the loading spectrum (see Eq. (7)) are assumed as 
 and 
. Besides, the S–N curve slope parameter 
 considered covers a range of values that are found in practical situations, i.e., 
 and 
 are presented (Vaillant, 2024; Vaillant et al., 2024).
The long-term fatigue damage 
 is evaluated based on several numerical simulations for all methods described previously in this work. These results are normalized with respect to the solution of the Brute Force Numerical Integration method using 
 (see Section 3.1.2.). In addition, regarding all Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods (including Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation method), the tolerance value for the coefficient of variation equal 
 is used in all analyses.
Regarding Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods, Table 4, Table 5 present the results of the normalized long-term fatigue damage for 
 and 
, respectively. These results are related to the correspondent number of numerical simulations 
 required for 
 to be achieved, i.e., 
. Additionally, Table 6, Table 7 show the corresponding results for both 
 values regarding GHQ and DRM alternatives. Table 8 presents the number of simulations 
 required for 
 to be achieved regarding 
 for the MCS-based procedures. Table 9 presents the corresponding figures for 
. For illustrative purposes, Table 10, Table 11 present the correlation coefficient of the control and short-term damage functions. Again, these results are relative to the correspondent number of numerical simulations required for 
 to be achieved. Table 12 presents the number of initial simulations used in connection with the Kriging metamodel as the control function. Additionally, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 show, respectively, the results of the normalized long-term fatigue damage, the coefficient of variation and the correlation coefficient for 
 rad/s considering 
. These figures present results for MCS-based methods obtained based on 20,000 numerical simulations.

From the previous results, it can be observed that in general Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods are indeed asymptotically convergent, i.e., they converge to correct results as the number of simulations increases. On the other hand, the number of simulations required to achieve a given accuracy is problem-dependent, i.e., it depends on the system properties and the S–N curve slope parameter. In fact, it is remarkable to notice that MCS-based methods exhibit slow convergence rates when the system’s natural frequency is low, especially for higher values of 
. Additionally, it is noticeable that all three Control Variates alternatives outperform the classical Crude MCS approach, which highlights that Control Variates cannot worsen MCS convergence rate regardless of the chosen control function as discussed in Section 3.2.2. It is not evident to notice which one of the three control functions is more efficient since their performances are problem-dependent. Sometimes they are more efficient than some Dimension-Reduction methods investigated, but there are many other cases they are not. Regarding the QMCS approach, the results show similar behavior in comparison to the Control Variates alternatives. Therefore, although it is significantly more efficient than Crude MCS, its performance is also problem-dependent, which is illustrated by the slow convergence rates when the system’s natural frequency is low, especially when the value of 
 increases.
In general, BDRM, TDRM and Gauss-Hermite quadrature technique can deliver great accurate results when at least 7 integration points 
 are used to assess the long-term fatigue damage for all cases investigated. Regarding UDRM, it performs reasonably well for high values of natural frequencies if at least 7 integration points 
 are used for evaluating the one-dimensional integrals. However, for natural frequencies close to 
 rad/s, the UDRM presented the highest error, over than 50%, even for 9 integration points, indicating there is a limitation in such methodology, which seems surpassed by the application of higher-order DRM approaches. Considering the results obtained so far and the number of structural simulations required (241), the BDRM in connection with the Gaussian quadrature using 7 integration points 
 seems to be a good choice to deal with the problem at hand. More specifically, the BDRM has presented an increased effectiveness over the other methodologies. These findings are aligned with the results obtained by Vaillant (2024), which corroborates the idea that there is a pressing need to consider higher-order DRMs approaches to evaluate fatigue damage in more complex problems.
4.2. Example 2: bimodal transfer function
This example investigates an idealized structural model where the transfer function is bimodal. In fact, two distinct bimodal transfer functions, named as Case 1 and Case 2, are taken. The main purpose of this example is to verify whether the consideration of a bimodal transfer function affects the efficiency and accuracy of the integration techniques investigated.
Table 13 shows all parameters associated to the transfer functions 
 and 
 (see Eq. (4)) for both cases investigated. Fig. 5 shows the bimodal transfer function associated to Case 1. The applied loading is the same of the previous case study.

Here, only the S–N curve slope 
 has been considered since it represents a more complex problem and entails more difficulties to the performance of the integration methods as seen in the previous example.

Note: UDRMY means that Y integration points are used in Gauss-Hermite quadrature for computing the UDRM’s integral. Same conventions apply to other methods.
Looking at these results, in a general sense, it is possible to draw almost the same observations found in the previous example. The number of numerical simulations for all MCS-based methods is problem-dependent. Of course, Control Variates approaches require less simulations than the Crude Monte Carlo Simulation Method, which could be expected. However, here it seems that a lower 
 should have been used to get more accurate results with these methods. Once again, good results are obtained when using GHQ, BDRM and TDRM with at least 7 integration points. On the other hand, UDRM can fail to provide accurate results in some situations even when a larger number of integration points is used to compute its integrals. Those results agree with the observations of Vaillant (2024).
5. Conclusions
In this work, the Control Variates method (CV) and a Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation (QMCS) approach were investigated as feasible methodologies to enhance the classical Monte Carlo Simulation method (MCS) in the assessment of the long-term fatigue damage of marine structures subjected to a combination of wind-sea and swell waves. In addition, some Dimension-Reduction methods (DRMs), namely, Bivariate Dimension-Reduction method (BDRM), Trivariate Dimension-Reduction method (TDRM), and Univariate Dimension-Reduction method (UDRM), as well as two Direct numerical integration approaches were also addressed. Regarding the latter ones, iterative approaches were not considered because the focus of this work is on procedures that use the same numerical simulations of the structure to compute the fatigue for all its hotspots. The methodologies were investigated considering two examples based on idealized structural models that try to mimic distinct structural behaviors found on marine structures. The accuracy and the number of simulations required by each method were presented as final results.
Structural systems with low natural frequency (close to 
; 
 rad/s) create difficulties for Monte Carlo Simulation-based methods (i.e., they require a large number of numerical simulations for achieving a reasonable accuracy). Additionally, UDRM also did not present accurate results for such systems, even when using many integration points to numerically solve its integrals. This latter result suggests there is a limitation of a general use of UDRM. On the other hand, BDRM (Bivariate Dimension-Reduction Method), TDRM (Trivariate Dimension-Reduction Method) and GHQ (Gauss-Hermite Quadrature) have achieved sufficiently high accuracy when at least 7 integration points were adopted for each integral dimension, i.e., 
. However, BDRM showcases the best overall performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, since among all these three methods it is the one that requires less structural numerical simulations (241 for a given combination of wind-sea and swell waves) to assess the long-term fatigue damage integral, even at lower values of 
. The results obtained for the DRMs are in agreement with the conclusions obtained by Vaillant (2024) and Vaillant et al. (2024) when dealing with more complex structural systems, i.e., flexible pipes installed in oil floating production units. Anyway, the main issue with DRMs is the lack of a simple procedure to estimate its error.
MCS (Monte Carlo Simulation), CV (Control Variates) and QMCS (Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation using Sobol’s sequence) methods were able to predict quite accurate results compared to the benchmark results, i.e., the one obtained by the Brute Force numerical integration method. These results were obtained using the number of numerical simulations 
 required for the adopted 
 to be achieved, i.e., 
. It is remarkable that the number of simulations required for all MCS-based methods is problem-dependent. As mentioned before, structural systems with very low natural frequencies require a huge number of simulations to get an accurate result. However, looking specifically at the Control Variates approach, all control functions investigated required less simulations to achieve accurate results of the annual fatigue damage when compared to the classical Crude Monte Carlo Simulation methodology. Still, the polynomial control function (CVN) and the one in the original space (CVO) presented very slow convergence rates for lower values of natural frequency, namely 
 
 rad/s, which show that these two alternatives do not work properly in a wide range of 
. More broadly, these two alternatives are case dependent since the correlation coefficient between each control function and the short-term fatigue damage function strongly depends on the natural frequency of the problem. The Kriging interpolation function (CVK) has demonstrated the highest overall convergence rate among all control functions presented in this study. For higher values of 
 and lower values of 
, it is possible to construct a Kriging interpolation function that results in a fast convergence rate for CVK method without the use of large numbers of sample data points to build it. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the Kriging metamodel performs better as the quantity of numerical simulations to develop it is higher. Thus, this is the best control function considering small values of natural frequency in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In practice, the sample size used to construct the Kriging interpolation function can be iteratively modulated until a satisfactory correlation between the control function and the short-term damage is achieved. Anyway, it should be pointed out that sometimes the number of numerical simulations required by this approach surpasses the amount required by BDRM. At last, the QMCS (Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation) has also demonstrated to be problem-dependent similarly to the Control Variates method. Although this approach can be very efficient in certain situations, the number of numerical simulations required by this method to achieve accurate results for lower values of natural frequency can be extremely high, especially when compared to BDRM.
As mentioned above, structural systems with low natural frequencies (
 rad/s) do create problems for most of the methods investigated. One possible explanation for this situation is that waves with periods in this range emerge in the joint probability distribution with a very low probability of occurrence. They are difficult to appear in a Monte Carlo Simulation-based procedure or even to be captured by any other integration approach. However, they induce high short-term fatigue damage because they are resonant. In other words, they create a region of significant contribution to the long-term fatigue damage integral that is far apart from the most frequent sea states, which leads to the need of more simulations, as shown in Appendix. Nevertheless, BDRM and TDRM approaches seem to be effective even in these cases.
Therefore, as an overall conclusion based on the case studies analyzed in this work, it seems that BDRM (Bivariate Dimension-Reduction Method) is a good general solution to solve the long-term fatigue integral associated to marine structures. It was shown to be a stable approach, i.e., its accuracy is not problem-dependent, and it requires a feasible number of numerical simulations to obtain suitable results.

Appendix.
Structural systems with low natural frequencies lead to some difficulties to evaluate the long-term fatigue damage integral. This is because of the behavior of the integrand of the long-term integral. Important regions that contribute to the integral result emerge far from the frequent sea states.
To illustrate this behavior, let us use the Brute Monte Carlo Simulation approach. The coefficient of variation of the long-term fatigue damage integral estimate obtained with this approach is given by (see also Eq. (30)):
(A.1)
where 
 is the number of simulations (samples), 
 is the expected short-term fatigue damage given by (see also Eq. (29)):
(A.2)
and 
 is the variance of the short-term fatigue damage, which is calculated as follows:
(A.3)
Eq. (A.3) reflects the “inertia moment” (or second-order moment) of the short-term fatigue damage with respect to its mean value, and 
 is the coefficient of variation of the short-term fatigue damage itself, i.e.,
(A.4)
Integrands with regions of considerable contributions to the mean that are far apart (spread) from it have larger variances and, consequently, higher values of 
. Noting Eq. (A.1), it is very clear that the higher the coefficient of variation 
 is, the higher is the number of simulations 
 required to achieve a given level 
.
Table A.1 illustrates the values of 
 for the cases analyzed in Section 4.1. As it can be seen from this table, the cases presenting the higher values of 
 are those that really required more simulations to achieve the desired accuracy (see Table 8, Table 9).

This behavior is also shown in Fig. A.1 where the projections of the short-term fatigue damage onto the wind-sea and swell 
 planes are presented for Example 1 considering two cases (
 rad/s and 
 rad/s) and S–N curve exponent 
. In this figure, it can be evidently noted that, mainly for wind-sea projections, the most contributing regions for the long-term fatigue damage change position depending on the system natural frequency.
In summary, it can be noticed that the low-frequency cases present a more complex integrand and require more simulations to be solved. In any case, it is worth mentioning that usually the accuracy of all Monte Carlo Simulation-based approaches is dependent on 
. Moreover, irregular or more complex integrands may also induce problems for some other numerical integration techniques.
