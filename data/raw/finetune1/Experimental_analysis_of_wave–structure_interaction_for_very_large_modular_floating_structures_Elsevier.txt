Abstract
Very large floating structures represent a relatively new frontier in offshore engineering, offering diverse opportunities for ocean utilization and management. These structures, characterized by their sizable dimensions and relatively low bending stiffness, are often constructed modularly and connected flexibly. Consequently, studying very large modular floating structure (MFS) requires considering both multibody hydrodynamics and connector dynamics. This study experimentally investigates the hydrodynamic behavior of MFS in waves, examining configurations ranging from a single module to three modules, with the measurements of their motions and deformations. Various wavelengths are considered, and the wave-induced loads on the hinge connections between floating modules are also recorded. Results show that attaching additional modules to an existing module decreased surge responses, while heave and pitch responses remained relatively unaffected. Examination of wave-induced deformations reveals that maximum deformations occur when the wavelength approximated the module length, consistent with hogging and sagging phenomena. Notably, the middle module experienced the most pronounced deformations due to constraints from both front and rear modules. Furthermore, the analysis of forces exerted on hinge joints reveals strong nonlinear characteristics. Forces at different harmonic components varied with wavelength, with the contribution from higher harmonics posing a risk of fatigue damage to the connectors. Serving as an experimental benchmark, these results contribute to the development and validation of numerical methods and offer guidance for the structural design of hinged connectors in floating bodies.

1. Introduction
Coastal regions around the world are facing increasing challenges due to population growth, resource exploitation, and the impacts of climate change. These factors have heightened the demand for innovative solutions to address space constraints and utilize ocean resources effectively. In response to these challenges, the concept of very large floating structures (VLFSs) has emerged as a promising solution (Watanabe et al., 2004, Suzuki et al., 2006, Lamas-Pardo et al., 2015). VLFSs are large-scale man-made structures designed to float on the ocean’s surface, offering a wide range of potential applications such as offshore energy generation, aquaculture, transportation hubs, and even residential or commercial spaces (Girard et al., 2002). These structures have the advantage of leveraging the vast expanse of ocean space to address the growing need for infrastructure and resources (Wang and Tay, 2011). Depending on their shapes and functionalities, the increasingly diverse VLFSs have been categorized in the literature, with several reviews providing comprehensive overviews. References such as Andrianov, 2005, Gao et al., 2011, Lamas-Pardo et al., 2015 and Jiang et al. (2023b) offer valuable insights into the classification and characteristics of VLFSs.
Designing a VLFS requires accurate predictions of its both hydrodynamics and hydroelasticity. Typically, these predictions are obtained through physical model tests or numerical simulations that have been validated against experimental data. Numerous experimental works have been performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of VLFSs, including their motion, deformation, and wave-induced loads. For instance, in the development of the Mega-Float project, experimental tests were conducted using a model with dimensions of 10 m in length, 0.5 m in width, and varying thicknesses (Utsunomiya et al., 1995). Subsequently, Yago and Endo (1996) tested a model measuring 9.75 m in length, 1.95 m in width, and 0.0545 m in thickness, analyzing the vertical displacements and bending moments under different wave periods and incident angles. Further investigations into the hydrodynamics and hydroelasticity of these continuous flexible floating structures under irregular waves or varying wave conditions have been carried out by researchers such as Kagemoto et al., 1998, Maeda et al., 2000 and Liu and Sakai (2002). It is worth noting that Ohmatsu (2006) provided an overview of experimental methods employing large-scale models in wave basins. Depending on the ratios between the structure length and wave length, the global response of floating structures is dominated by either rigid body motions or elastic body motions, as outlined in the work by Suzuki et al. (2006). More recently, Zhang and Schreier (2022) conducted a comprehensive review of wave interaction with continuous flexible floating structures, introducing a new category known as very flexible floating structures (VFFS). An experimental test of a VFFS constructed from a chloroprene foam rubber sheet in regular waves can be found, for example, in the work of Schreier and Jacobi (2021).
Due to their size and complexity, VLFSs are often constructed modularly, with individual modules interconnected to form a cohesive structure (Xie et al., 2020). Unlike traditional VLFSs, which are subject to significant bending moments and shear forces due to their large size, modular floating structures (MFS) offers several advantages over traditional monolithic structures (Wang et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2021). Firstly, it allows for greater flexibility in design and construction, enabling customization to suit specific project requirements (Drummen and Olbert, 2021). Additionally, modular construction facilitates easier transportation and assembly of the structure, particularly in remote or offshore locations where logistical challenges may arise (Flikkema and Waals, 2019). Moreover, MFSs can be easily expanded or reconfigured to accommodate changing needs or operational conditions (Jiang et al., 2023a). This adaptability is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where infrastructure requirements may evolve over time. Furthermore, modular construction techniques enable rapid deployment and scalability, making MFS a versatile and cost-effective solution for various marine applications (Wittmann et al., 2021).
Several experimental studies have examined MFSs in various configurations and wave conditions. Waals et al. (2018) conducted a conceptual test on a diamond-shaped floating mega island composed of larger and smaller triangular floaters. Ding et al. (2020) investigated the characteristic evolution of a chain-type floating system with up to five modules connected by hinges and elastic mooring lines, where the module responses under different wave periods and heights were analyzed. Furthermore, these studies were extended to examine the responses of an 8-module VLFS under three different encounter wave conditions (Ding et al., 2021). Subsequently, Ding et al. (2022) studied the effect of connector topology on the dynamic characteristics of a three-modular floating platform in different wave conditions. Assbrock et al. (2022) experimentally measured motions and loads in long-crested waves with various floater configurations, revealing higher order structural responses and impact loads. Ding et al. (2023) investigated parametric resonance in a five-module floating structure, revealing the influence of wave condition, connector stiffness, and number of modules. Assbrock et al. (2022) analyzed the interaction between a large freely floating articulated structure and regular waves using computer vision target tracking, providing insight into the hydroelasticity framework. More recently, Dong et al. (2024) examined the hydrodynamic characteristics of a double-module floating structure with cable-fender connectors, highlighting the weak coupling strength of the connectors and the resonance frequency of the floating units.
Nevertheless, existing experimental studies on MFSs have predominantly focused on their hydrodynamic responses in two-dimensional wave flumes, often neglecting three-dimensional effects and structural deformation measurements. The literature still lacks comprehensive experimental studies on the hydrodynamic responses and hydroelastic deformations of MFSs. For example, Liu et al., 2021a, Liu et al., 2021b experimentally studied the hydroelastic responses of a hexagon enclosed platform (HEP) model, which consists of six trapezoidal floating modules rigidly connected. Their findings indicate that while hydroelastic responses are induced, their amplitudes are smaller than those caused by low-frequency wave loads. Subsequently, Liu et al. (2023) proposed and experimentally studied a hinged connection HEP, focusing on comparing different connecting joints, including rigid and hinged connections. Their results conclude that the hinged connection experiences a larger vertical bending moment than the rigid connection. Another notable experimental work on the hydroelasticity of MFSs is the study of a multiply-connected domain tourism platform in head waves by Wang et al. (2024). This platform, assembled with several modules connected in a heart shape, revealed that structural sections near the midship are likely to suffer the largest vertical bending moment under survival wave conditions, with wave loads primarily dominated by the 2-node vertical bending vibration of the platform. Given the complexity of the floating modules in these studies and the discrepancies observed between numerical simulations and experimental measurements, there is a need for a benchmark experimental campaign using simple geometric shapes to study the hydrodynamic responses of MFSs while considering structural deformations. Such an experiment should use a basic floating module, such as a floating barge, to provide reliable reference data and aid the development of numerical methods for estimating the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic behavior of MFSs. To address this gap, our study conducts an experimental analysis of wave–structure interactions for very large MFSs using simple box-type floating structures, investigating configurations ranging from a single module to those with three modules. Our focus lies on examining the hydrodynamic characteristics of flexibly connected MFSs, while also recording the deformations of each structure. Various wave lengths are considered, and the wave-induced loads on the hinge connections between floating modules are analyzed as well. Following this introduction, the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model tests, detailing the experimental setup and data postprocessing methodology. Section 3 presents results in terms of motions and deformations, followed by the conclusions discussed in Section 4.
2. Model tests
This section begins by outlining the dimensions of the floating structure. Next, the various test configurations are described, followed by an explanation of the adopted measuring method. This section ends with demonstrating the methodology used for data postprocessing.
2.1. Particulars of floating module
In the experiment, the hydroelastic response of the large-scale floating structure is considered, with the model comprising aluminum and polyethylene foam sheets. The upper aluminum sheet has a thickness of 0.008 m, while the lower foam board has a thickness of 0.10 m. The aluminum sheet primarily provides vertical bending stiffness for the floater, while the polyethylene board offers buoyancy. Two small piece of aluminum sheets are placed at the bottom of the model, consistent with the width of the floater, to prevent separation between the aluminum sheet and foam sheet. The associated dimensions and material properties are listed in Table 1.
Four lifting lugs, made of Q235 material and weighing 0.068 kg each, are installed at the four corners of the floating model to serve as mooring line fairleads. The floating model, a box-type structure measuring 2.0 m in length, 0.6 m in width, 0.108 m in height, and 0.027 m in draft, is constructed accordingly. A detailed depiction of the model is provided in Fig. 1, which also includes a photograph. The floating model is arranged with its length aligned parallel to the wave tank’s length. The end of the model closest to the wave maker is designated as the front end, while the opposite end is considered the rear end. Stress–strain sensors are positioned at the surface of each floating body at the 
, 
, and 
 positions, with 
 being closer to the front end. Each of the stress–strain sensor has a length of 78 mm. To measure the motions, forces, and deformations of the floating modules, non-contact optical six-degree-of-freedom measurement instruments, tension sensors, and strain sensors are employed. Table 2 lists properties of such a floating module at its basic design stage.

2.2. Experimental setup
The model tests were conducted in the wave tank at Dalian University of Technology, which is 170 m in length and 7 m in width, with a water depth of 4 m. A piston-type active absorbing wave maker was installed on the left side of the wave flume to generate regular waves with varying frequencies and heights. Additionally, an artificial sloping beach was constructed at the opposite end to minimize wave reflections. Fig. 2 provides an overview sketch of the experimental setup, which includes three configurations considered during the model tests. In cases involving multiple modules, hinge joints are employed between the modules, and the loads acting on these joints are recorded. The gap distance between floating modules is set to 0.1 m.
Four nylon ropes were used to prevent the floating modules from drifting away from the camera system during the experiments. Each mooring line is pretensioned with a initla length of 7.5 m and a diameter of 10 mm. The four mooring lines are guided through lifting lugs and connected to the tank wall at the same height as the body-fixed fairleads. The dynamic responses of the floating modules were recorded using the six-degree-of-freedom optical acquisition system installed onshore. Waves continued to act on the floating model until the transitions stabilized, typically after 60 to 100 s. The measured data were recorded at a frequency of 200 Hz. For this study, the results of the floating modules under a regular wave height of 
 m with various wave periods are presented. Table 3 lists the considered wave conditions for the one-, two-, and three-module configurations, respectively.

2.3. Data postprocessing
To illustrate the approach for interpreting experimental results, Fig. 3 displays a representative time series of dynamic responses of the floating module in surge (
), heave (
), and pitch (
), along with their corresponding frequency domain representations. Notably, all results are normalized using the wave amplitude 
, wave number 
, wave period 
, and the wave frequency 
. Excluding the transitional periods, the results from ten stable wave periods are presented herein. Response amplitude operators (RAOs) are then computed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) based on the first-order motion components. It is worth noting that the floating module’s natural periods in horizontal motions, such as surge and sway, depend on the mooring system. These periods are generally much longer than those of the incident waves considered and are often activated by second-order difference-frequency wave components. Although linear wave theory was used during wave generation, nonlinear components may still exist due to wave propagation in the wave basin. Low-frequency motions were indeed observed at the beginning of each test during the transition phase, typically before 100 s. While low-frequency motions and mean drifts are important for mooring design, they have limited effects on the floating body’s motions and loads within the incident wave frequencies. Therefore, they are excluded from our analysis and will not be discussed in the present study. As a result, the deformations of the single floating module in a regular wave with 
 s are depicted in Fig. 4, highlighting three locations along the floating module: at 
, 
, and 
. Here, 
 represents the length of the module, with its front defined at the left end. We observe that the structural bending moments are greatest at the midpoint, i.e., at 
, and relatively smaller at both ends. Interestingly, the bending moment at the front position, 
, is moderately larger compared to the position at 
, a phenomenon that will be further examined in the following section.
Fig. 5 presents three typical wave examples to illustrate how the body interacts with different wave conditions. In the case of a relatively short wave of 
, significant wave diffractions can be observed from the distinct wave patterns. As the wavelength increases to 
, smoother free-surface elevations are noted for both the one- and three-module configurations, indicating that the floating modules interact with longer waves in a more linear manner. These results are intended to provide an overview of how these floating modules interact with incident waves, with a quantitative assessment provided in the following section.

3. Results and discussion
In contrast to conventional floating offshore structures, the hydrodynamic characteristics of MFSs depend not only on the functionality of individual floating modules, but also on the number of modules. This section examines the motions and deformations of considered MFSs. We begin by assessing the hydrodynamic responses of the floating modules in regular waves, considering three different configurations. Next, we estimate the deformations of these floating modules, which are crucial for ensuring structural integrity. Finally, we address the nonlinearities inherent in the experimental works, highlighting the need for further studies in this area.
3.1. Wave-induced motions
For the single floating module, Fig. 6 illustrates the resulting responses of the module in surge, heave, and pitch under regular waves. Surge and heave motions are normalized against the wave amplitude 
, while pitch motions are normalized against the wave slope 
. It is observed that surge and heave motions initially decrease and then increase with increasing wave length. Their minimum values occur when the wavelength approximates the module length, i.e., 
. While a similar trend in the pitch response is not observed for 
 close to unity. In general, the pitch response increases with increasing wavelength, gradually approaching a constant value.
For the two-module case, Fig. 7 depicts the resulting responses of the modules in surge, heave, and pitch under regular waves. It can be observed that surge and heave motions initially increase, then decrease, and finally increase again with increasing wavelength. Particularly, local crests are observed for heave motions close to 
, while their local troughs are observed at 
. Regarding the pitch responses, a clear trend is observed, that is, their values increase with increasing wavelength, gradually approaching a constant value.

Fig. 6. Motion responses of a single module in surge, heave, and pitch under regular wave conditions.

Recall that the two floating modules are connected using hinge joints, allowing articulated structures to rotate around the axis of the hinged joint. Therefore, the surge response of the front and rear bodies is almost identical. Regarding responses in heave and pitch, generally, the front body exhibits a larger amplitude compared to the rear body, and these discrepancies become more pronounced for short waves, where 
 for the considered conditions. Comparing to the one-module case, we observe that attaching a new module to an existing module significantly decreases surge responses for large wavelengths. Additionally, their local troughs shift from 
 to 
. However, heave and pitch responses are not significantly affected by the newly attached floating module, as their motions are not strongly constrained by the hinge joints.

Fig. 7. Motion responses of two modules in surge, heave, and pitch under regular wave conditions.

Accordingly, Fig. 8 illustrates the resulting responses of the three-module case in surge, heave, and pitch under regular waves. Compared to the two-module case, attaching another module to the existing modules further reduces the surge responses. However, more complex local crests and troughs are observed over short wavelengths compared to the two-module case. Regarding the heave responses, they generally exhibit overall similarity to those of single-module and two-module cases, except for the complex local vibrations observed for short wavelengths. Specifically, the local trough of the front module shifts to a longer wavelength compared to the two-module case, occurring at 
. It is also interesting to note that, except for this local trough, the front body generally has relatively larger motion amplitudes than the rear module, while the middle module has the smallest values over all considered wavelengths. This can be attributed to the constraints imposed by the front and rear modules, which affect the dynamic responses of the middle module from its both sides. In terms of pitch responses, it is observed that responses from all three modules have more or less the same magnitudes. This is attributed to the fact that hinge joints are adopted within the experiment, allowing floating modules to rotate freely around the hinged axis.

3.2. Wave-induced deformations
In addition to the dynamic responses of the floating modules in waves, this section presents their deformations measured at three positions for each module. Fig. 9 plots the resulting deformations at positions corresponding to 
, 
, and 
 for the single-module case. The deformations at these measured positions exhibit a similar variation tendency, initially increasing and then decreasing with the increase of wavelength. Their maximum values occur when 
 approximates unity. This characteristic is consistent with the well-known hogging and sagging phenomena, where the maximum bending moment value for sagging and hogging occurs when the ship length approximates the wavelength. Furthermore, it is observed that position around 
 experiences the largest structural deformations compared to the other positions. Additionally, the position at 
, which interacts with the incident wave initially, undergoes more pronounced deformation than the position at 
, which interacts with the incident waves later.
For the two-module case, Fig. 10 summarizes the deformations of the modules at measured positions under regular waves. Both front and rear modules exhibit similar deformation characteristics, initially increasing and then decreasing with wavelength. Maximum values occur around 
 nearing unity. The front module’s maximum deformation occurs at 
. Notably, due to the presence of the rear module, the deformation at 
 of the front body exceeds that at 
. At 
, the front module’s deformation remains comparable to the single-module case, while deformations at other positions increase compared to the single-module scenario. When considering the rear module, deformations at 
 and 
 are quite similar, unlike the front module. Additionally, deformation at 
 remains comparable to the single-module case. Their magnitudes decrease for all three positions under short waves, where 
. Overall, the largest deformation occurs at the middle part of the front module in the two-module scenario, highlighting the importance of careful monitoring during operations.

In the three-module case, Fig. 11 plots the associated deformations at measured positions under regular waves. Comparing to the two-module scenario, its front module shows similar trend characteristics across the monitored positions, with maximum values shifting towards longer wavelengths, from 
 to 1.53. Similarly, the rear body exhibits comparable deformation characteristics to the two-module case, with magnitudes at 
 comparable to those at 
. Overall, deformations at all positions are similar to those of the rear body in the two-module case. Notably, the middle module experiences the most pronounced deformations in the three-module case, with the maximum value occurring around 
. These findings, coupled with observations on dynamic responses, indicate that although the middle module has the smallest motion amplitudes, it experiences the largest bending moment due to constraints from both front and rear modules. The subsequent section analyzes the forces acting on their hinge connections.

3.3. Exemplary time-domain results
To gain insight into the interactions between multiple bodies and the behavior of these floating modules in waves, we provide sample time series of body motions and deformations in a regular wave of 
 in this section. This data will also serve as a reference to aid in the development of nonlinear time-domain simulation tools. This wave condition was chosen as a typical case because the largest deformations were observed in the single floating module configuration. A detailed comparison between the single, double, and triple modules in the time domain can highlight the effects of adding more floating modules on the system’s motions and deformations.
From Fig. 5(a), we observe a higher frequency surge motion for the single module case, in addition to the surge motions within the wave frequency. This can be attributed to the taut mooring system, whose dynamics introduces an additional motion frequency. As the wavelength approaches the structural length, complex motions within the resonance region occur, as shown in Fig. 6. For the two-module case, the floating system’s natural period in surge shifts to about 
, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Consequently, relatively linear surge motions are observed, with both modules experiencing larger motion amplitudes compared to the one-module case. It is observed that the surge amplitude of the rear module is slightly larger than that of the front module. This discrepancy in surge might be attributed to differences in their pitch motions, as the floating system drifts towards the rear and encounters less restriction from the rear mooring lines. Regarding the surge motions of the three-module case, their amplitudes decrease for the considered wave condition. Nonlinear components are also observed in these motions, evidenced by the skewed crests and troughs.

 for the one-, two-, and three-module configurations: (a) surge, (b) heave, (c) pitch, (d) deformation at 
, (e) deformation at 
, (f) deformation at 
.

In terms of the heave motions shown in Fig. 12(b), they generally follow the waves in a linear manner. For the two-module case, some nonlinear components are observed in the rear module, evident by the flatter crests and sharper troughs, which are asymmetric about the 
-axis. This phenomenon indicates that the rear body is affected by the front body either through its diffracted and radiated waves or the hinged joint. Nevertheless, the heave amplitudes for the three-module case are more or less the same under the considered wave condition. Regarding the pitch motions depicted in Fig. 12(c), linear motions predominantly contribute as well. Adding more modules to the rear of an existing module suppresses the pitch motions for the considered wave. For the two- and three-module cases, the front module generally has a larger amplitude than the rear module due to encountering the incident wave first. In the three-module case, the middle and rear modules exhibit more or less the same pitch amplitude.
Accordingly, the deformations of these floating modules at 
, 
, and 
 are plotted in Fig. 12(d), (e), and (f), respectively. Inspecting their time series, we find that the crests at 
 are skewed towards the front side, resulting in asymmetry about the vertical 
-axis. The crests and troughs at 
 are relatively symmetric both vertically and horizontally. However, the time series at 
 show crests skewed towards the rear side. Generally, deformations at 
 have the largest amplitudes compared to those at 
 and 
. For the same location of each module, the front module that encounters the incident wave first generally has larger amplitudes than the middle and rear modules. The rear module has the smallest deformations in all considered two- and three-module cases. Moreover, higher-frequency vibrations are observed in the deformations of the two- and three-module cases. These structural vibrations might be attributed to the vibrations of the hinged joint, which will be discussed in the following section.
3.4. Forces on hinge joints
Unlike the responses and deformations illustrated in Fig. 12, the forces exerted on the hinge joints between the floating modules exhibit strong nonlinear characteristics. For instance, Fig. 13 presents the measured horizontal force components acting on the hinge joints for the two-module case. Results under three regular waves of 
, 1.32, and 4.13 are provided, representing short-length, middle-length, and long-length waves, respectively. As observed, comparable magnitudes of force components at the first harmonic (i.e., wave frequency), the second harmonic, and the third harmonic are noted under the short regular wave of 
. Interestingly, the contribution from the third-harmonic component is slightly larger than that of the first-harmonic component, posing a risk of fatigue damage to the connectors.
For the middle-length regular wave of 
, however, the horizontal force shows a decreasing trend in its harmonic components with increasing harmonic number. Notably, the third and fourth harmonic components have comparable magnitudes. In comparison to the short-length wave above, the current first-harmonic force component is much larger, roughly three times larger, while the second-harmonic component is comparable to that of the short-length wave condition. Regarding the force in long wavelengths of 
, it is dominantly contributed by its first-harmonic component, comprising at least 95% of the total force for the considered wave condition. While some high-frequency vibrations are also observed, although they hardly contribute to the body’s dynamic responses, they pose a risk of fatigue damage to the connectors.

4. Concluding remarks
In this study, we investigated the hydrodynamic responses and deformations of MFSs under regular waves, where three different configurations were considered. Unlike conventional floating offshore structures, MFSs’ hydrodynamic characteristics depend not only on individual module functionality but also on the number of modules. Specifically, the forces acting on the hinge joints between adjacent modules were also experimentally measured. Our experiments utilized simple box-type floating structures constructed from aluminum and polyethylene foam to investigate their behavior under various wave conditions. This study explored single, double, and triple-module configurations, emphasizing the importance of understanding the hydrodynamic responses and structural deformations of MFSs to ensure their stability and integrity in real-world applications.
Key findings from the analysis of wave-induced motions include:
•
For the single-module scenario, its surge and heave motions initially decrease and then increase with increasing wavelength, with minimum values occurring when the wavelength approximates the module length. Pitch responses generally increased with wavelength, gradually approaching a constant value.
•
In two-module configurations, surge and heave motions exhibited complex behaviors with local crests and troughs at different wavelengths. Pitch responses indicated a consistent increase, with the front module showing larger amplitudes due to its initial interaction with waves.
•
The three-module setup demonstrated further reduction in surge responses compared to the two-module setup, with more intricate local variations in heave motions and comparable pitch responses across all modules. And their amplitude values remained relatively unaffected.
Key findings from the analysis of structural deformations include:
•
The single-module configuration experienced maximum deformations at the module midpoint, consistent with known sagging and hogging phenomena.
•
Two-module configurations displayed similar deformation patterns for front and rear modules, with the front module showing more pronounced deformations at the midsection.
•
For the three-module setup, the middle module experienced the largest deformations due to constraints from the front and rear modules, indicating significant internal stress within the structure.
Key findings from the results in the time domain include:
•
Time-domain analysis revealed the influence of mooring dynamics on surge motions, particularly for single-module configurations with higher frequency components.
•
Heave and pitch motions followed the wave patterns linearly, with nonlinear components becoming more prominent as modules were added.
•
The introduction of additional modules altered the system’s natural periods, affecting the overall dynamic response to waves.
Furthermore, the analysis of forces exerted on hinge joints revealed strong nonlinear characteristics. Forces at different harmonic components varied with wavelength, with the contribution from higher harmonics posing a risk of fatigue damage to the connectors. However, a limitation of our study is that only head waves were considered. This is due to the experimental work being conducted in towing tanks rather than an ocean wave basin, where the tank’s width is insufficient to exclude bank effects for different incident wave directions. Additional investigations are needed to delve into the nonlinearities inherent in MFS dynamics and to devise strategies for mitigating potential risks linked to wave-induced forces on hinge joints. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of considering MFS configurations in optimizing performance and ensuring structural integrity.
