1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, extensive experimental investigations have established grain boundaries (GBs) in nanocrystalline materials (NCs) as critical microstructural elements for radiation damage mitigation [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Beyond their well-documented influence on mechanical properties [10], [11], [12] and mass transport characteristics (e.g., GB-induced electron scattering that degrades electrical conductivity [13], [14]), these interfacial defects exhibit remarkable defect sink efficiency. When bulk crystalline materials undergo radiation damage from high-energy particles (neutrons, protons or heavy ions), the primary degradation mechanisms involve the generation of point defects (self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and vacancies (Vs)) and their subsequent aggregation into extended defects such as voids and dislocation loops. In contrast, the high GB density in NCs enables effective defect elimination through interfacial trapping and annihilation mechanisms, thereby enhancing radiation tolerance [1], [2], [3], [4], [15], [16], [17].
However, the radiation healing dynamics involve complex, non-equilibrium interactions between defects and GBs that remain incompletely understood [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Recent experimental observations and theoretical simulations reveal several critical aspects of this complexity. The GB–defect interactions may evolve with irradiation dose, evidenced by the disappearance of void-denuded zones during prolonged irradiation formed in early irradiation periods [26]. Radiation could induce structural transformations at GBs in several face-centered cubic (fcc) metals under high interstitial loading rate [27]. SIAs that segregate at the GB could further govern V annihilation kinetics [28]. These findings challenge the classic view that GB is a static and unsaturated defect sink. More specifically, such results indicate the fact that there may be dynamic competition between defect absorption and interfacial saturation effects.
Therefore, to better understand and regulate the radiation resistance of NCs, two atomic mechanisms related to GBs need to be clarified: (i) the interaction mechanism between defects (especially SIAs) and defect-modified GB, and (ii) the SIA states near GBs that may govern subsequent defect evolution pathways. Why do SIAs play such a critical role? On the one hand, SIAs tend to preferentially segregate at GBs driven by two intrinsic characteristics: (i) significantly reduced migration energy barriers (0.02 eV vs. 1.8 eV for Vs in tungsten) and (ii) strong SIA–GB binding energies (several eV) [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. This kinetic advantage enables SIAs to reach GBs 1030 times faster than Vs at 300 K (requiring ∼ 1018 s per jump for Vs vs. ultrafast SIA migration at ∼10-12 s per jump). Current theoretical frameworks attribute radiation resistance of NCs to SIA-mediated annihilation mechanisms, primarily through interstitial emission [18], [20], [28], [29] and cruise along the GB [15], [17], [22], [23]. On the other hand, the interfacial SIA concentration exhibits extraordinary geometrical amplification – for grains with a grain size of 100 nm, GB-adjacent regions (occupying ∼ 3 vol%) achieve SIA densities 32.5 times higher than bulk (assuming 
 to be concentration of SIAs in the bulk, as all SIAs locate at the GB, the SIA concentration at the GB will be 97 %/3%*
). This enrichment becomes particularly pronounced under low-temperature irradiation, where Vs remain immobile while SIAs maintain high mobility.
Once SIAs accumulate at the GB, the local atomic structure and functional behavior of the GB may undergo changes. The above key points, hence, can be summarized into two questions: whether the GB has a saturated capacity for SIAs and how the excess SIAs at the GB influence the SIA/V behavior in adjacent regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we systematically simulated the SIA overload process by continuously introducing SIAs into the GB structural units, and revealed a critical phenomenon: self-blocking of SIAs near the GB. A SIA cluster (SIAn) initially created near the GB was instantly trapped by the GB during the structural relaxation, which blocked there and hindered the GB’s further trapping of the SIAn. Newly formed SIAns near GBs enter a constrained metastable state, which exhibit dual functionality: an exceptionally larger number of annihilation sites with Vs near the GB than the SIAn trapped at the GB and meanwhile an unexpectedly long-ranged repelling interaction with the SIA in the bulk region. The systems (W, Fe, Mo) were chosen based on their engineering application in fusion reactors.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the computational methods used in the study. Section 3 presents the results about the SIA states near the GB that is pristine or loaded with SIAs. Section 4 provides a discussion analyzing the energetic/kinetic reasons for the SIA blocking near the GB, the temperature dependence and its possible effect on V annihilation and GB stability. Finally, Section 5 offers the conclusions.
2. Computational methods
2.1. Interatomic potentials and the calculation of defect energetics
Embedded atom method (EAM) potentials were employed to describe interatomic interactions in W [30], Mo [30], and Fe [31]. These potentials were validated to accurately reproduce experimental values of equilibrium lattice constant, cohesive energies, elastic constants, V/SIA formation energies, migration energies, and other relevant properties of the studied systems.
Prior to studying SIAs behavior near W/Fe/Mo GBs, the stable SIAn configurations in bulk were determined using a methodology analogous to that in Ref. [17]. A cubic model with each side length of 10a (a is the lattice constant) was built for investigating the SIAn structures in the bulk. This exploration exceeds the practical scope of first-principles calculations due to the larger system sizes and configurational space required (particularly for W and Mo). For example, in two-unit-cell bcc model, the cluster SIA5 exhibits approximately 
 possible configurations (each interstitial atom in SIA5 occupies two adjacent positions at ± 1/4 〈1 1 1〉 ). Such a large configuration space for the SIAn is beyond the computational capacity of first-principles calculations. The present calculations were thus performed based on empirical potentials via in-house developed code containing molecular statics/dynamics (MS/MD) modules.
For interstitial-type defects in W/Mo, individual SIAs were modeled as <1 1 1> -oriented crowdions, while a <1 1 0> dumbbell was used for Fe. Larger clusters in all metals were assumed to consist of parallel <1 1 1> crowdions. The initial SIA configurations in W were created through inserting atoms at ± 1/4<1 1 1> positions relative to lattice sites (denoted as O ± ), whereas Fe SIAs were placed at ± 1/4〈1 1 0〉. Structural relaxations were performed using the conjugate gradient method.
To characterize the SIAn energetics, both SIA formation energy and binding energy in the bulk and near the GB were introduced in a common way [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] and calculated as follows. Formation energy for a SIAn in the bulk was defined as:
(1)
where 
 and 
 are total energies of the system with and without SIAn, respectively. Cohesive energies (
) are 
 8.90 eV (W), 
 6.82 eV (Mo), and 
 4.12 eV (Fe).
The binding energy of one SIA to the SIAn was calculated as:
(2)
For the SIAn located at site α near the GB, its formation energy was defined as:
(3)
where 
 and 
 are the total energies of the GB system with and without the SIAn at site α, respectively. The binding energy of the SIAn to site α at the GB was defined as:
(4)
In addition to SIAn formation energy, one needs to know V formation energy at site α around the SIAn that is in the bulk, trapped at the GB, or blocked near the GB when calculating V–SIAn annihilation volume relevant for annihilation volume calculations in radiation damage models [25], [32], [33]. V formation energy was defined as
(5)
where 
 and 
 are total energies of the system with and without one V at site α, respectively. Similar definition and calculation of annihilation volume have been adopted in previous work [18].
Fig. 1(a–c) show stable SIAn configurations in bulk W. Each <1 1 1> crowdion in the SIAn comprises ∼7 displaced atoms aligned along <1 1 1> direction. Small clusters adopt compact and parallel <1 1 1> crowdion arrangements stabilized by high binding energies (2 ∼ 6 eV via Eqs. (1), (2)). Progressive increment in size promotes the development of SIA clusters into dislocation loops. This strong clustering tendency justifies focusing on interstitial clusters (rather than single SIAs) behavior near GBs. Notably, multiple metastable configurations exist (e.g., SIA2 exhibits a 0.3 eV energy difference between “O+” and “O-” states; SIA2 has 9 metastable states within 1.0 eV of the ground state).

2.2. GB models and simulation details for SIAn–GB interactions
To study the SIA–GB interactions, different GB models were constructed: high-angle symmetric tilt GBs of Σ5(3 1 0)/[0 0 1] and Σ25(4 3 0)/[0 0 1]; low-angle GBs of Σ85(7 6 0)/[0 0 1] and Σ61(11 1 0)/[0 0 1], following established construction and relaxation protocols [17], [18], [19]. Taking the GB of Σ5(3 1 0)/[0 0 1] as an example, a reference lattice point near the GB was selected, and the bulk lattice coordinates ([1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1]) were transformed into the Σ5(3 1 0)/[0 0 1] GB coordinate system ([0 0 1], [
], [3 1 0]) via geometrical calculation: 
, where 
 is the atomic position vector in the original system, and 
, 
, 
 are the unit vectors of the GB system. This transformation aligns with methodologies used in prior studies of SIAns interactions with GBs [28]. These simulation cells are all cubic, with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) applied to all the three directions. The model size can be found in supplementary Table S1. In the other model (see Fig. 1(d)), two mirrored GBs of Σ5(3 1 0) within a periodic supercell were employed for continuous interstitial loading simulations. The model size in the direction normal to the GB is about 40 Å, while in the tilt axis [0 0 1] direction, the model size is 10a (a is lattice constant).
To investigate the trapping of SIAn by the GB and the breakdown of SIA blocking states, MD simulations were performed across a certain temperature range, with temperature control conducted via a velocity-rescaling thermostat. The system atoms evolve under canonical (NVT) ensemble with zero pressure. Other simulation details (e.g., time step, simulation duration and temperature) can be found in supplementary Tables S2–S3.
3. Results
3.1. Trapping of interstitials clusters by the GB
With the bulk configurations of the SIAn established (Fig. 1), we first investigated the behavior of SIAns near GBs in W using MS simulations. For each SIAn (n = 1–10), an initial configuration was placed within ∼15 Å of the GB. During the relaxation, the SIA gradually segregates into the GB. Such trapping process was confirmed by MD simulations at 300 K (see supplementary Fig. S1). We further analyzed the configurations of SIA1–SIA10 at the GB of Σ5(3 1 0) in both real space and potential energy space (Fig. 2, Fig. 2) after structural relaxation, revealing correlations between their energetic states and morphologies. In real space (Fig. 2(a)), SIA1 is highly localized at the GB, appearing as discrete point-like defect (as marked by the red circle). While the single SIA resembles an isolated point defect, SIA2–SIA5 form small clusters occupying vacant sites within the GB structural units. These clusters reside within a confined GB stress field with a semi-width of ∼5 Å.

(a) Atomic configurations of SIA1–SIA10 near the GB (marked by the red line), which was generated by sequentially introducing the SIA into the GB, followed by energy minimization via molecular statics. Atoms are colored by their potential energy. And atoms with energy deviations less than 0.1 eV are omitted for clarity. (b) Potential energy contours near the GB-trapped interstitial clusters (SIA1–SIA10), corresponding to the real-space configurations in (a). For comparison, atomic configurations and energy contours near the pure (without defects) GB are included. For (b), we just removed the atomic configuration and directly drew the potential energy distribution, without involving any non-physical processing. The blue area represents the bulk-like region with lower potential energy. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

In potential energy space (Fig. 2(b)), the localized, point-like character for SIA1–SIA5 is further emphasized. This contrasts sharply with bulk SIAs, which adopt extended <1 1 1> crowdion configurations (Fig. 1(c)). SIA6–SIA10, however, exhibit disordered and irregular stress fields, lacking the well-defined localization seen in SIA1–SIA5. Despite this, their stress fields remain spatially constrained, similar to those of SIA1–SIA5.
The stress fields of GB-interstitials differ markedly from bulk counterparts. For example, a single SIA in W bulk generates an ellipsoidal stress field with semi-major (∼18 Å, aligned along <1 1 1> ) and semi-minor (∼5.4 Å) axes [34]. At the GB, however, the localized point-like morphology and reduced spatial extent of SIA stress fields suggest a significant reduction in volumetric distortion energy compared to bulk <1 1 1> crowdion bundles. Notably, SIA1–SIA5 are fully trapped at the GB. Here, the SIA trapping state is determined in two ways: first, by identifying its location at a favorable site within the GB structural unit, based on low energy [22], [23], [28], and second, by calculating its energy relative to that at the lowest-energy site within the GB structural unit.
3.2. Self-blocking of interstitial clusters near the GB
In addition to the trapping of the SIA1–SIA5, SIA6–SIA10 exhibit incomplete absorption near the GB, indicating a transition from trapped states to stuck ones. This SIA configuration of being stuck, distinct from the “point-like” and complete trapping state, was defined as the SIA blocking state.
The spontaneously trapped SIAns are initially localized within ∼10 Å of the GB (Fig. 2), but become preferentially stabilized at specific GB sites through strong binding interactions. These observations align with conventional understanding of GBs as effective defects sink. However, Fig. 2(b) reveals incomplete absorption of SIA6–SIA10 clusters, with partial cluster components remaining near the GB. This suggests that these clusters may retain aspects of their bulk morphology near GBs, contrasting with the complete trapping of the single SIA at the GB. Interestingly, bulk SIAns themselves act as strong sinks for single SIAs as indicated by large SIA–SIAn binding energies [28], though single SIAs captured maintain their characteristic <1 1 1> crowdion configuration even when bound to clusters with binding energies of 3 ∼ 6 eV.
The incomplete absorption of SIA6–SIA10 indicates that SIAs previously captured by the GB could modify subsequent evolution of defects. Previous studies by Bai et al. [20] demonstrated that GB-associated single SIAs substantially influence V diffusion and annihilation near GBs in copper, with similar effects observed in W, Mo and Fe systems [15], [17], [18], [19]. This work particularly focuses on the morphological evolution of SIAns near GBs due to their fast diffusion towards GBs.
Therefore, we examined how pre-existing GB-trapped SIAns affect incoming bulk SIAs. New SIAns were introduced at potential well boundaries, where single SIAs would normally be immediately absorbed by pristine GBs. Post-relaxation analysis revealed striking differences: unlike the barrier-free absorption observed at pure GBs (Fig. 2), subsequent incoming SIAns became stabilized near (but not absorbed by) GBs at 0 K, as shown in Fig. 3 for the Σ5(3 1 0) GB in W. This self-blocking effect arises when existing SIAns occupy GB trapping sites, effectively shielding GB to prevent subsequent defect absorption. The self-blocked SIAns maintain their <1 1 1> crowdion configuration while developing GB-anchored crowdion configuration. Crucially, their characteristic long-range stress fields persist with bulk-like characteristics, extending up to 20 Å into the matrix – four times the half-width observed for pristine GBs or those containing trapped SIAns.

The display scheme is identical to that in Fig. 2(a). (b) Potential energy contours corresponding to the real-space configurations in (a). The display scheme is identical to that in Fig. 2(b).

To establish broader applicability of this “self-blocking” effect observed near W GBs, we investigated SIAn behavior near the symmetric tilt GB of Σ5(3 1 0) in Mo (Fig. 4(a)), which exhibits defect properties similar to W. Results consistent with W were observed in Mo. For instance, stable SIA clusters in bulk Mo comprise <1 1 1>-oriented crowdion bundles. When introduced within a critical range of the GB, these SIAns are immediately trapped. Trapped SIA1–SIA6 adopt localized point-like configurations with significantly lower energies at the GB compared with bulk values (1.73/7.37, 2.97/12.82, 4.60/17.68, 8.19/21.73, 6.28/25.77 and 9.05/29.60 eV for SIA1–SIA6, respectively). SIAns blocked near the GB partially maintain their <1 1 1> crowdion configurations, exhibiting long-range stress fields.

We further examined SIAn behaviors near the Σ5(3 1 0) GB in Fe (Fig. 4(b)), a bcc system where single SIA stabilizes as <1 1 0> dumbbells in the bulk. While similar self-blocking phenomena were observed in Fe, key differences emerged. MS calculations revealed that SIA1–SIA3 adopt parallel <1 1 0> dumbbell configurations, consistent with first-principles results [35]. SIA4–SIA6 form compact, deformed <1 1 0> dumbbells, whereas SIA7–SIA10 resemble the parallel <1 1 1> crowdions seen in W and Mo. Upon introducing a SIA cluster near the GB, immediate trapping occurs. However, the self-blocking effect requires 4–8 additions for SIA1–SIA7 and 2–3 additions for SIA8–SIA10. This is distinct from W and Mo, where the blocking effect occurs after adding a single interstitial/cluster near the trapped site. These differences likely stem from variations in SIA configurations and diffusion mechanisms. In W and Mo, SIAs migrate one-dimensionally along <1 1 1>, while SIAs in Fe follow the translation-rotation Johnson mechanism [36].
For <1 1 0> dumbbells, GB trapping involves curved atomic chains, unlike the linear <1 1 1> chains of crowdions. Potential energy analysis shows that displaced GB atoms gradually become isolated, undergo bond-breaking, and return to lattice sites, dissolving the dumbbell and trapping the interstitial as a point defect. Conversely, during 〈1 1 1〉-type SIAn absorption, crowdion atoms along 〈1 1 1〉 revert to lattice positions, while the leading atom becomes trapped. Subsequent SIAn additions near this trapped region no longer segregate freely but accumulate near the GB, suggesting that early-trapped atoms impede further GB absorption of 〈1 1 1〉 crowdions (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, in addition to the GB of Σ5(3 1 0), similar self-blocking phenomena were also observed for several other GBs (see supplementary Figs. S2–S4). Therefore, the SIA blocking is not an accidental phenomenon within a single GB or system, but more likely a universal effect. However, it must be pointed out that the above results (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) were obtained via MS simulations at 0 K, the situation under limited temperature is uncertain. In the following sections, further exploration will be conducted on the dynamic causes and temperature dependence of the blocking effect.
4. Discussion
4.1. Energy landscape and atomic mechanism for SIAn trapping by the GB
Structural relaxation at 0 K enables the calculation of SIAn formation energy (
) using Eq. (3), which quantifies the thermodynamic stability of SIAns near the GB. The resulting energy landscape (Fig. 5(a) for the single SIA in W) reveals three distinct regions: (i) Bulk region: 
 approaches the bulk value (∼9.48 eV). (ii) Transition region: 
 slightly deviates from the bulk value. (iii) Trapping region: 
 drops sharply near the GB core. At the GB core (sites E1-C1), 
 decreases to 2.32 eV, corresponding to a binding energy of ∼7.16 eV relative to the bulk. This reduction is consistent with prior studies using EAM [31] and bond-order potentials [28], [37], confirming the strong sink strength of the GB. For larger clusters (SIA2–SIA10), the binding energy increases gradually with n (Fig. 5(b)). For Mo and Fe, the calculation results are similar (Fig. 6(a–b)). Such results, attributed to the GB’s excess free volume accommodating SIA-induced lattice strain, highlight a robust thermodynamic driving force for the SIAns migration to the GB and their subsequent trapping.

During relaxation, SIAns initially located 5–6 atomic layers from the GB core spontaneously migrate into the GB, demonstrating barrier-free trapping. Similar behavior has been reported for single SIAs near several metallic GBs [15], [19], [37]. Post-trapping analysis by examining the exact location of the SIAn at the GB core revealed that only 2–3 atomic layers at the GB core serve as storage sites for SIAns.
Fig. 5(c) illustrates the normalized SIAn formation energies (relative to bulk values) in W, depicting a “squared potential well” profile with a depth ∼0.6. For Mo and Fe (Fig. 6(c–d)), although the depth and width of the potential well are not exactly the same, the basic image is consistent. These match previous findings for SIAs near several W, Mo and Fe GBs [17], [28], [36], suggesting a universal trapping mechanism across different materials. Notably, intermediate states between bulk and trapped configurations were observed, alongside anisotropic energy landscapes. For example, SIA1 migration along G1 → F1 → E1 → D2 yields energies of 9.40, 2.28, and 2.70 eV, while the path G2 → E1 → C1 maintains a constant 2.32 eV (Fig. 5(a)). This anisotropy implies that the trapping kinetics and final SIAn positions depend on initial cluster orientation and proximity to the GB.
This difference in morphologies (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) is further reflected in the formation energies of SIAns located in distinct regions, as shown in Fig. 5(d). For SIAns trapped at the GB or in the bulk, their formation energies exhibit two distinct linear trends that scale with the cluster size n (Fig. 5(d); also see normalized formation energy in Fig. 5(c)). However, SIAns blocked near the GB exhibit formation energies that fluctuate between two levels (Fig. 5(d)), confirming their entrapment in the GB vicinity. Interestingly, for clusters such as SIA6–SIA10, the formation energies near the GB are slightly higher than those in the bulk. The self-blocking effect thus pins 
 to some extent, which are otherwise one-dimensionally mobile in the bulk.
To elucidate the SIA accommodation mechanism at the GB, we examined the SIA trapping process. As demonstrated in Fig. 7(a), when generating SIAs at identical positions near a GB structural unit (the hexagon configuration shown), we observed sequential trapping of up to four interstitials along the [0 0 1] tilt axis through a replacement chain mechanism (RCM). This process, indicated by light-yellow arrows tracing atomic displacements from initial to final positions, exhibits almost barrier-less kinetics and is accompanied by significant energy release (Fig. 7(b)). Notably, subsequent interstitial introduction near the saturated structural unit requires extended atomic rearrangements, as evidenced by green arrows in Fig. 7(a). Beyond four SIAs, additional ones undergo directional switching to occupy adjacent trapping sites (e.g., T6 in Fig. 7(c)), suggesting steric repulsion between existing and incoming interstitials. Complete occupation of the two neighboring structural units induces substantial lattice distortions, particularly evident in the displacements of atoms A1, B1, C1, and D1 (Fig. 7(d)). This cooperative displacement pattern generates novel trapping configurations at the GB. Specifically, new metastable sites emerge through synergistic interactions between primary trapped interstitials (SIA1/SIA2 in Fig. 7(d)) and displaced matrix atoms (A1/B1 in Fig. 7(d)). The displacement is as large as 0.6 Å, forming a dislocation structure around the SIAs.

4.2. The energetic, kinetic reasons and temperature dependence of the blocking effect
As revealed above, for the SIAn trapping into the GB, a SIAn composed of a bunch of crowdions enters the GB’s free volume and becomes trapped therein (Fig. 7(e)). This trapping is driven by the significantly reduced formation energy and migration energy barrier of the SIA near the GB.
However, MS calculations demonstrate that SIAs accumulating at the GB could block newly arrived SIAn and elevate their energy, as illustrated in Fig. 7(f). In other words, the formation energy of the SIA blocking state lies between the formation energy of SIA trapped at a pure GB and that in the bulk (indicated by E2 in Fig. 7(g)). From a thermodynamic perspective, this metastable SIAn tends to transition to a more stable state. To this end, the blocked SIAs need to migrate to other unoccupied structural units, as suggested by Fig. 7(a–c). This process is not spontaneous but requires overcoming a certain energy barrier (Ea4 in Fig. 7(g)). MD simulations at low temperatures (<50 K) also confirmed this: We found that the SIA no longer barrier-freely approaches to the occupied GB and then resides there. Instead, it was blocked near the GB for a certain time duration (e.g., several picoseconds) before eventually being trapped at the GB. Therefore, at low temperatures, the blocking state naturally forms once the GB structural unit has been occupied by excessive SIAs.
Accordingly, a new problem arises: Can the blocking state be maintained at an elevated temperature? We speculate that the blocked SIA could overcome the energy barrier and migrate to vacant sites at a certain temperature, leading to the breakdown of the blocking state. To validate this, we applied a certain temperature to the SIA blocking state near the GB to observe its evolution behaviors. As suggested by supplementary Figs. S5–S6, depending on the system and GB character, the self-blocking state of SIAns gradually dissolves and transitions into a trapped state at different temperatures. Certainly, this process also involves a time scale issue (see supplementary Table S3). Based on this, the self-blocking of SIAns near the GB seems to be only a confinement effect at low temperatures. However, imagine that if all the structural units in a certain segment of the GB are occupied, the newly arrived SIAs may not be able to find a place to accommodate themselves, and new blocking states may appear again. Alternatively, the SIAns are unable to segregate into the GB occupied by excessive SIAs and instead are directly reflected back into the bulk. Regarding the SIAn refection [28], our prior work showed that excess SIAs loaded into the GB induce lattice distortion near the GB. This distortion creates a shoulder in the SIA energy profile near the GB, becoming a potential barrier to prevent SIA segregation (Ea3 in Fig. 7(g)). This phenomenon is particularly evident in W, as the SIA diffusion energy barrier within the W block (∼0.02 eV) is significantly lower than Ea3, making it more prone to being reflected.
4.3. Effect of self-blocking on vacancy annihilation
To quantify the impact of self-blocking on V annihilation, we calculated the V–SIAn annihilation volume (Vann), defined as the total number of V sites around a SIAn where spontaneous recombination occurs. Annihilation sites were identified by introducing Vs near blocked SIAns and evaluating their formation energies: sites with negative formation energies correspond to spontaneous recombination during 0 K structural relaxation (see Refs. [15], [18], [37], [38]). Fig. 8(a) compares Vann for SIAns in three states: bulk, blocked near the GB, and trapped at the W GB (similar results for the SIAns near Mo and Fe GBs are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 8, respectively). The blocked clusters exhibit the largest Vann, significantly exceeding that of trapped ones. For instance, a single blocked SIA (near the Σ5(3 1 0] GB) has Vann = 60, while Vann = 3 for its trapped counterpart. These trends align with the morphologies and local potential energy distributions of SIAns (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). While bulk SIAns have comparable Vann to blocked ones, their efficacy in removing bulk Vs is limited in large-grained materials due to rapid migration to surfaces [18], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. In contrast, SIAns blocked near the GB efficiently annihilate adjacent Vs. The structural distinction between trapped and blocked clusters clarifies this behavior: trapped SIAns resemble point-like configuration within the GB, whereas blocked SIAns extend crowdion-like configuration into the bulk, enhancing V recombination in the GB vicinity. Thus, the SIA state critically determines its capacity for annihilating Vs.

Fig. 8. Energetic effects of the self-blocking mechanism. (a–c) Annihilation volume of Vs associated with SIA1–SIA10 clusters in the bulk, blocked near the GB, and trapped at the Σ5(3 1 0) GB in W, Mo and Fe, respectively. (d–e) Binding energy of a single interstitial to a blocked cluster and the average binding energy per interstitial within the cluster. (f) Illustration of SIA states and energy hierarchy near the GB. Three aligned spheres represent a SIA. Energy levels are labeled as: E1 for bulk SIAn (far from GB), E2 for blocked SIAn near the GB, and E3 for trapped SIAn at the GB. Eb is the binding energy of bulk SIAn to the GB. A blocked SIAn exhibits two properties: (i) a large annihilation volume for Vs (Vann, light red region), and (ii) a repulsive cross-section (light blue disk) along the <1 1 1> direction, with repulsion extending over L = 20 Å (light red ellipsoid, based on Fig. 7(d) calculations). The cross-sectional area of each SIA in the SIAn is defined as 
 (where a is the lattice constant). For a SIAn, the total cross-sectional area scales as 
. The repulsive volume is given by

Beyond direct V annihilation, self-blocking influences the interaction of incoming bulk SIAns with the GB, exposing a cross-sectional interface to the bulk. We probed this interface by calculating the binding energy of a single SIA to SIA1–SIA10 along the <1 1 1> direction. As shown in Fig. 8(d–e), the negative binding energies indicate repulsive interactions between blocked SIAn and incoming SIAs. This repulsion intensifies with cluster size (n) and extends over 20 Å – far exceeding the intrinsic trapping range of a pure GB. Such long-range repulsion likely impedes defect elimination by diverting incoming SIAs away from the GB.
Fig. 8(f) illustrates the energetic hierarchy of SIAn states near the GB derived from our calculations. The GB acts as a squared potential well for SIAns, preferentially trapping them. Bulk SIAns generate extensive <1 1 1> crowdion stress fields, while trapped clusters collapse into point-like configurations. The SIAn in different states has respective “energy levels”. Self-blocked clusters occupy intermediate energy levels (E2) between the bulk value (E1) and those for trapped states (E3). Clusters with energies higher than E1 thermodynamically favor diffusion away from the GB. Critically, blocked SIAns combine two key attributes: (i) a large Vann for bulk V removal and (ii) a <1 1 1>-orientated repulsive interface that deflects incoming SIAs.
4.4. Comparison to experiments
While direct experimental observation of this self-blocking effect remains elusive, analogous phenomena exist. For example, carbon or boron impurities at dislocations in palladium reduce hydrogen segregation after annealing [46]. Experiments show that the segregation of hydrogen to dislocations at 323 K decreases markedly in palladium doped with interstitial carbon or boron after a relatively low temperature (423 K) annealing. Under real irradiation conditions in a reactor, SIAs and Vs are often produced together with hydrogen and helium, these co-segregating defects possibly compete for GB sites. Due to lower migration energy barriers, hydrogen/helium may reach GBs before slower-moving interstitials, blocking trapping sites [47], [48], [49], [50]. This mechanism is particularly relevant at low temperatures, where interstitials dominate segregation (e.g., in irradiated metals [5], [6], [51], [52], [53]). The characteristic temperature could denote the temperature at which interstitials become mobile [54], with other events (e.g., rotation and migration near a blocked state) remaining inactive. At high temperatures, GB motion or phase transitions may destabilize blocking states.
It is important to note that interactions between GBs and defects under irradiation are inherently complex. The complexity arises from the unbalanced nature of defect fluxes near GBs and defect accumulation within the GB, which can induce synergistic effects involving both defect behavior and GB structural/dynamic changes [54], [55], [56]. Beyond well-known mechanism (such as interstitial emission enabling V annihilation near GBs in copper [20]), and complex interactions involving interstitial participation observed in Fe and W [15], [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [28], [29], [36], [37], GB themselves exhibit intricate responses to continuous irradiation. These include structural phase transition triggered by SIA/V loading [27] and dynamic distortion or relative motion to immobile V clusters near the GB [54], [55], [56]. The proposed interstitial blocking phenomenon thus represents a necessary addition to the existing mechanisms, especially relevant in the context of the GB’s intrinsic capacity and its efficiency for defect occupying.
5. Conclusions
This study employs molecular statics and dynamics simulations to elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing grain boundary (GB) interactions with self-interstitial atom clusters (SIAn) in body-centered cubic (bcc) metals (tungsten, molybdenum, iron). The key findings are summarized as follows:
(1)
“Self-blocking” mechanism. Accumulated SIAn progressively occupies GB trapping sites, spatially confining subsequent clusters within near-boundary regions. These confined SIAns exhibit intermediate energy states between fully GB-trapped configurations and bulk states, a phenomenon universally observed across all three metals. Besides, the blocking effect exhibits temperature dependence, i.e., raising the temperature can promote the breakdown of the blocking state.
(2)
Dual functionality of confined SIAns. (i) Enhanced vacancy annihilation capacity: Blocked SIAns demonstrate vacancy annihilation volumes over three times greater than GB-trapped clusters, attributed to their preserved bulk-like atomic configurations. (ii) Long-range repulsion: They generate sustained repulsive interactions (1 – 2 nm) with bulk SIAs, potentially altering defect trapping dynamics of the GB.
(3)
The self-blocking mechanism reveals a saturation limit for GB defect absorption and formation of an extended “boundary recombination zone” that significantly enhances vacancy–SIA recombination efficiency. The spatially confined SIAn provides a potential channel for defect elimination at low temperatures.
This work lays a theoretical foundation for understanding radiation resistance mechanisms in nanocrystalline materials, particularly at a low temperature.
