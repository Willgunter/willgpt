Abstract
High-repetition-rate free electron lasers (FELs) deliver both high single-pulse energy and high average power, which impose stringent thermal and mechanical demands on beamline diagnostic devices operating at full repetition rate. Wavefront-preserving optics and advanced wavefront sensors are essential components for FEL facilities to maintain beam quality. Single-grating interferometry based on the fractional Talbot effect is a wavefront diagnostic method that provides high sensitivity, single-shot accuracy, and exceptional adaptability. This study presents a multiscale thermal evaluation of a Talbot grating wavefront sensor operating at a repetition rate of 100 kHz for a soft X-ray FEL. The analysis focuses on the thermal response of the diamond grating across multiple temporal and spatial scales. The single-pulse analysis combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) with the Two-Temperature Model (TTM), using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation code to evaluate potential material damage under ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The pulse-by-pulse analysis applies a three-dimensional heat-conduction model in ANSYS, automated via PyMechanical, to track heat accumulation over repeated pulses. The steady-state pulse-averaged analysis employs submodeling in ANSYS Workbench to capture temperature, deformation, and stress distributions at the micrometer scale. At 1 nm X-ray wavelength, the transient temperature rise of the grating remains below one-tenth of its melting point, confirming the absence of single-pulse damage. The pulse-by-pulse analysis predicts an equilibrium temperature of 36 °C, in close agreement with the 39 °C obtained from the steady-state model. The associated thermal deformation remains within fabrication tolerances, with peak-to-valley values below 13 nm, aperture shifts under 18 nm, and diameter changes less than 0.3 nm. Additionally, the steady-state simulation yields a maximum temperature of 183 °C for the Cerium-doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG:Ce) scintillator under ambient radiation, accounting for the detailed diffraction pattern. These results satisfy operational requirements and provide design-level insights that support the engineering deployment of the sensor in high-power FEL beamlines.

1. Introduction
X-ray and extreme ultraviolet free electron lasers (FELs) deliver high-repetition-rate, high-power beams that can be focused to micrometer- and nanometer-scale spots, making them indispensable tools for advanced scientific research [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Wavefront information is essential for both beamline operations and experimental endstations. In experimental endstations employing coherent imaging and phase-contrast techniques, precise wavefront data is crucial for achieving high-fidelity results [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. For beamline operations, wavefront measurements help to optimize the alignment of optical components such as Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors and bimorph deformable mirrors, enabling diffraction-limited focusing and precise sample-beam alignment [[13], [14], [15]]. In addition, wavefront characterization at key locations such as after undulators provide references for evaluating FEL output characteristics, which help identify beam imperfections and guide corrections to ensure stable and consistent beam delivery.
Several advanced techniques are commonly used in wavefront diagnostics for FELs, including Hartmann wavefront sensing [16,17], speckle tracking [[18], [19], [20]], double-grating interferometry [[21], [22], [23], [24]], and single-grating interferometry [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. Among these, single-grating interferometry based on the fractional Talbot effect is well suited for high-repetition-rate FELs, as it provides high power-handling capacity. This capability is critical, as cumulative thermal loads on optical components can degrade beam quality and require diagnostics that operate at the full repetition rate. Furthermore, this method offers high sensitivity, high single-shot accuracy, and adaptability to various beamline configurations, including compatibility with both collimated and tightly focused beams. Its robustness and versatility make it a dependable choice for FEL applications. While Talbot grating wavefront sensors provide significant benefits for FEL diagnostics, their performance under high-power operation depends on effective thermal management. Single-pulse damage and cumulative heat loads from high-average-power FEL beams may impose substantial thermal and mechanical stresses on the Talbot grating, the key optical component [[30], [31], [32], [33]]. Such stresses can lead to deformation, surface degradation, or reduced operational lifetime, all of which directly compromise the accuracy and stability of wavefront measurements.
Conventional thermal analyses of optical components in FELs have primarily relied on macroscopic models that assume averaged thermal loads while neglecting temporal and spatial structures. Such approaches offer only a limited description of the physical processes and are generally adequate at low repetition rates and powers. However, their limitations become more pronounced under high repetition rates and powers, where the pulsed nature of FEL beams and their associated peak-power effects remain insufficiently addressed. Microscopic damage mechanisms, particularly those accessible through molecular-level simulations, are important but have received far less attention. Experimental observations have further revealed discrepancies between predictions from conventional macroscopic models and the actual thermal response under pulsed FEL beams, underscoring the necessity of a systematic multiscale analytical framework [34].
In this study, transient and steady-state thermal analyses are conducted as part of a three-step multiscale evaluation of the diamond grating in the Talbot grating wavefront sensor for a high-repetition-rate soft X-ray FEL operating at 100 kHz. Additionally, the steady-state thermal analysis is extended to the detection Cerium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG:Ce) scintillator to determine the pattern-induced temperature rise. Damage studies evaluate transient material behavior under pulsed FEL irradiation, providing insights into durability and structural integrity [35]. Steady-state thermal analyses are fundamental for understanding equilibrium thermal effects and for guiding designs to withstand photon-induced heat loads [[36], [37], [38], [39]]. The pulse time structure and the three-step analysis framework are illustrated in Fig. 1. The FEL pulse train features a single-pulse energy of 100 μJ, a pulse duration of 100 fs (full width at half maximum, FWHM), and a pulse interval of 10 μs, corresponding to an average power of 10 W. The first step focuses on single-pulse transient damage analysis, conducted by coupling molecular dynamics (MD) with the two-temperature model (TTM) to simulate microscopic energy transfer and ultrafast transient thermal responses under X-ray irradiation. The second step addresses pulse-by-pulse transient thermal response, where the post-pulse temperature is imported into ANSYS [40] and PyMechanical automates the sequence to evaluate whether heat accumulation under high repetition rates causes material melting. The third step involves pulse-averaged steady-state thermal analysis, which employs the submodeling approach in ANSYS Workbench to evaluate micrometer-scale temperature distributions and thermally induced deformation under averaged power conditions. This sequence reflects the necessity of understanding short-term dynamics prior to evaluating long-term performance. Meanwhile, a comparison is made between the quasi-steady-state equilibrium temperature derived from the pulse-by-pulse analysis and the macroscopic steady-state result. The consistent trends across all steps confirm that the Talbot grating wavefront sensor preserves adequate thermal stability under representative high-power FEL conditions. This multiscale methodology provides both physical insight into thermal behavior and practical guidance for the reliable integration of optical diagnostics in high-repetition-rate FEL beamlines.

2. Overview of the talbot grating wavefront sensor
This section presents the background of the Talbot grating wavefront sensor. First, the physical principle of the single-grating interferometric method is introduced, emphasizing the distinct thermal loads imposed by the FEL beam on the diamond grating and the YAG:Ce scintillator. Second, the overall sensor design and mechanical structure are described to facilitate understanding of the principle. Finally, the operating conditions of the sensor are specified as the basis for the subsequent thermal calculations.
2.1. Principle of the fractional talbot effect
When a plane wave illuminates a periodic grating, diffraction produces periodic intensity distributions known as Talbot images, with distances determined by the grating pitch and wavelength. The fundamental Talbot distance for plane-wave illumination is given by:
(1)
where 
 is the grating pitch and 
 is the wavelength of the illuminating light. At integer multiples of this distance, the periodic intensity patterns repeat without phase shifts, forming exact self-images of the grating. At fractional multiples 
 of the fundamental Talbot distance, where 
 and 
 are coprime integers with 
, the intensity patterns exhibit increased feature density or phase shifts, while preserving the periodic structure. Fractional Talbot distances are expressed as:
(2)
The existence of fractional Talbot distances reduces the required grating-to-detector distance and offers advantages for compact experimental setups. The simulation procedure using Fresnel diffraction follows the approach of Liu et al. [27,28], and the Talbot imaging results at the fundamental and several fractional distances are shown in Fig. 2.

(b–d) Talbot images corresponding to fractional distances of 1/4 and 1/2, and the fundamental distance of 1. Complete self-imaging occurs at a Talbot distance of 1, with phase shift at 1/2 and increased feature density at 1/4.

In practical applications, the illumination wavefront can be considered as parabolic rather than planar, corresponding to a highly directional Gaussian beam propagating from the focal point. When the propagation distance is much greater than the Rayleigh length, an accurate approximation can be applied for such parabolic-wave illumination, under which the Talbot plane shifts and the intensity patterns exhibit a magnification effect. This effect applies uniformly to both integer and fractional Talbot distances, preserving the characteristic intensity distributions. The Talbot distance for parabolic illumination can be expressed as:
(3)
where 
 is the distance from the focal point to the grating. The magnification factor 
 is defined as:
(4)
These formulas indicate that, in a Talbot grating wavefront sensor, the incident power is predominantly absorbed by the grating, with only a small fraction reaching the detector through diffraction.
2.2. Sensor layout and mechanical structure
A wavefront sensor based on the fractional Talbot effect is designed with a compact two-chamber architecture. Fig. 3 illustrates the physical design of the key components, and Fig. 4 presents the corresponding mechanical design. The main chamber is fixed and contains the Talbot grating, which serves as the central optical component, together with a YAG:Ce scintillator for alignment. The diamond grating is mounted on an oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper holder that provides three positions for grating switching. The grating is clamped against indium foils to improve interfacial thermal conductance, while the holder incorporates water-cooling channels to further enhance heat dissipation. The cooling requirement necessitates that main chamber remain fixed. A movable detection module is connected to the main chamber through bellows. A YAG:Ce scintillator converts X-rays into visible light, which is redirected by a 45° mirror into a visible-light microscope coupled to a large-field CMOS camera. The camera has a pixel pitch of 2.5 μm and an array of 8192 × 8192 pixels, enabling high-resolution detection while remaining protected from direct X-ray exposure. However, its frame rate is limited to 20 fps, meaning that each image corresponds to a multi-pulse integrated measurement. The microscope provides a variable magnification range from 1 × to 10 × . The magnification is determined to ensure that the magnified Talbot image size is at least three times the detector pixel size, thereby ensuring adequate spatial resolution. The separation between the grating and the detection scintillator can be adjusted from 0.42 to 0.58 m to accommodate different fractional Talbot distances. The grating is nominally located about 2 m downstream of the focal spot, with positional flexibility to accommodate varying beamline geometries and experimental requirements.

The grating is made of diamond, with dimensions of 30 mm × 30 mm and a thickness of 200 μm. Its effective area of 15 mm × 15 mm contains a square array of circular apertures. The detection scintillator has lateral dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm with a thickness of 100 μm. To cover the 1–30 nm wavelength range, two sensor configurations are employed. The detailed wavelength coverage is presented in the Appendix, obtained by applying different grating pitches at fractional Talbot distances following the approach of Liu et al. [27,28]. Configuration 1 covers 1–8 nm, and Configuration 2 spans 4–30 nm. Each configuration incorporates three gratings with pitches of 30, 34, 38 μm and 60, 68, 76 μm, respectively, all designed with a 1:5 duty cycle. In this study, the 30 μm-pitch grating is selected as a representative case for subsequent analysis, with geometrical parameters identical to the configuration in Fig. 2(a). The sensor design ensures an appropriate magnification factor, maintains a practical detection distance, and minimizes diffraction-induced blurring at large fractional Talbot distances.
2.3. Operating conditions
The Talbot grating wavefront sensor is designed for the Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (S3FEL), a high-repetition-rate FEL facility currently under construction in China [41]. S3FEL consists of a 2.5 GeV continuous-wave superconducting linear accelerator and three beamlines, covering the 1–30 nm wavelength range. The facility is designed to operate at a maximum repetition rate of 1 MHz, with single beamline operating at 100 kHz. The FEL delivers an average output power of 10 W, with specific pulse parameters given in Fig. 1. The sensor operates under normal incidence. Within the working spectral range, X-rays are fully absorbed by the non-transmissive regions of the diamond grating, while only a small fraction of the incident power is transmitted through the aperture array to the detection scintillator. Table 1 summarizes the critical operating conditions at the grating, including the boundary wavelengths of the 1–30 nm range and the carbon K absorption edge at 4.4 nm. The FWHM beam size at the grating varies between 0.6 mm and 6 mm depending on the wavelength. Based on these parameters, the peak power density and single-pulse photon flux are calculated to highlight the considerable thermal load imposed on the grating under high-power FEL operation. Under the assumption of a parabolic wavefront, approximately 3.14 % of the incident power is transmitted to the detection scintillator. This transmitted beam experiences a minimum magnification factor of 1.2, leading to a reduction in both power density and single-pulse photon flux by a factor of 1.44 in subsequent analyses.

Wavelength (nm)	FWHM beam size (mm)	Peak power density (W mm−2)	Single-pulse photon flux density (μm−2)

4.4	1.8	2.73	6.0 × 105
30	6.0	0.25	1.1 × 105
The operating conditions of both diamond grating and YAG:Ce scintillator remain well below the single- and multiple-shot damage thresholds reported for comparable wavelengths at the European XFEL facility [33]. These experimental benchmarks confirm a sufficient safety margin. Nevertheless, the present study aims to establish a simulation-based framework for evaluating thermal loads in high-power pulsed FEL optical components, with applicability to other diagnostic systems subject to similar challenges.
3. Multiscale modelling of single-pulse FEL-induced heating in diamond
This section investigates the transient thermal response of a single FEL pulse incident on the diamond grating. Under the operational conditions described earlier, the peak power of an individual 100 fs pulse could reach 1 GW, which leads to a rapid temperature rise within the optical component. Although the spot size at the sensor is expanded to the millimeter scale due to its defocused position (in contrast to the micrometer-scale spot at the endstation), the deposited energy density remains sufficiently high to cause a measurable temperature rise. To analyze this process, a MD framework coupled with TTM is adopted to simulate the material temperature evolution under ultrafast single-pulse FEL irradiation. The governing equations of the model and the selection of physical parameters are first described, followed by numerical simulations under the specified operating conditions. The electron and lattice temperature evolution within 20 ps after the pulse is analyzed, and the atomic-scale structural responses within the first 5 ps are examined. On this basis, pulse-by-pulse analysis is performed using the obtained temperature evolution to assess whether thermal accumulation and material melting will be discussed in the next chapter.
3.1. Microscopic modelling of ultrafast FEL-induced damage
The prediction of material damage under ultrafast FEL irradiation is crucial for the design and fabrication of optical components. Coupled approaches that integrate MD with TTM provide an accurate description of electron behavior and energy transfer between electrons and the lattice, which cannot be captured by traditional methods when applied independently [42]. On this basis, a damage prediction program is developed using the MD-TTM framework. Transient material damage is considered absent if the temperature rise induced by a single pulse is less than one-tenth of the material's melting point.
Monte Carlo (MC) coupled with MD is primarily used for micro-simulations, where MC describes ionization, excitation, and recombination of electrons, while MD tracks the real-space dynamics of atoms, ions, and ionized electrons [[43], [44], [45]]. The work of P. J. Ho et al. is referenced [46], and the LAMMPS molecular simulation package has been extended by incorporating an MC algorithm to describe photoionization, Auger processes, fluorescence, electron-impact ionization, and recombination [47]. All reaction cross sections are obtained from XATOM, an ab initio code based on the Hartree-Fock-Slater method [48].
For MD, at each simulation step the coordinates of all particles are updated based on the forces derived from the interaction potential. The equations of motion follow Newtonian mechanics:

 and

Photoionization, inner-shell Auger decay, and fluorescence decay are treated as stochastic processes and implemented using MC methods. The elementary process rate of atom/ion 
 is obtained from XATOM. For photoionization, the reaction rate is expressed as 
, where 
 is the cross section and 
 is the X-ray flux. The corresponding probability within the interval dt is 
. The probabilities of all processes follow the exponential decay law. Random times are then generated as

 is updated if 
. It is assumed that each atom/ion undergoes at most one process within the interval 
. If multiple processes simultaneously satisfy the condition, the type of process is selected randomly according to the relative magnitudes of 
. The energy dependence of the electron-impact ionization cross section is calculated using the binary-encounter-dipole (BED) model [49,50]:

 denote the incident electron energy, the orbital kinetic energy, the binding energy, and the number of electrons in that orbital, respectively. The dipole constant 
 is approximated as 1. For recombination processes, the system is regarded as recombined if the electron remains bound to the same ion for n complete periods [51].
Following this, TTM is employed to analyze the transient temperature response of the material after FEL irradiation. In this model, electrons and phonons are treated as distinct but interacting subsystems in local equilibrium, and it is widely used to simulate non-equilibrium thermal conduction in materials subjected to high-energy inputs such as laser irradiation or particle beams [45,[52], [53], [54]]. While MD simulates photon absorption and electron thermalization on the femtosecond timescale, the resulting electron temperature distribution is transferred to TTM for further analysis once the majority of the electron energy falls below the excitation threshold. Energy lost or gained by the lattice is exchanged with the electron system, and the electron energy is transported via heat diffusion, modelled by a finite difference solution to the heat diffusion equation on the grid. This procedure is implemented in the TTM module of the LAMMPS package, where electron temperature evolution is governed by the heat diffusion equation [55,56]:

(7) are dependent on the electron temperature and are dynamically updated during the simulation [57]. The electrons excited through photoionization and collision ionization are treated as free electrons, with the electronic specific heat expressed as 
 , where 
 is the electronic heat capacity coefficient,

 is the Fermi energy. In the present calculations, 0.13 % of the electrons are ionized, yielding 
. The electronic thermal conductivity is given by

, where 
 is the effective electron mass, and 
 is the speed of sound. Since the electron temperatures considered in this study remain relatively low, the contribution of 
 is neglected.
With the electron temperature field and coupling constants obtained from the MC-TTM subsystem, the atomic equations of motion are extended from the Newtonian form to a Langevin form. In this formulation, the friction and stochastic terms embody electron-phonon coupling and electronic stopping [55,56]:
(8)
where

 is the friction coefficient, and 
 represents the energy gain from bombardment with electrons. In this work, the interaction force 
 is determined from the interatomic potential, which is directly implemented in the LAMMPS code, while the contribution of 
 is neglected. The friction coefficient 
 consists of two contributions: a phonon-related term 
 associated with electron-phonon coupling, and an electronic stopping term 
. In the present study, only 
 is considered, which is expressed as 
, where 
 is the cell volume and 
 is the total number of atoms in the constant electron temperature cell. The initial temperature of the atomic system is set to 22 °C. The atomic temperature is defined by the kinetic energy of the atoms as 
.
Owing to computational resource constraints, a single FEL shot with a pulse length of 100 fs (FWHM) is simulated under periodic boundary conditions. The simulation box size is restricted to 8 × 8 × 8 nm3, containing more than 9 × 104 atoms for diamond. The three-body Stillinger-Weber potential and the Coulomb potential are employed to describe atomic interactions [59]. Electron-electron and electron-ion interaction potentials are modelled using the Coulomb potential. To avoid numerical instability caused by the singularity at the zero distance, the Coulomb potential is modified to

 and 
 are the charges of the interacting particles,

 is a softening parameter introduced to regularize the potential near 
. Here, 
 is fixed, typically in the range of 0.5–1 Å [44,60]. The deposited dose is calculated at the pulse center, where the FEL beam is incident normally onto the material surface. This corresponds to the maximum dose deposition and serves as an upper bound. The transient simulation time is limited to less than 20 ps, and thermal conduction between the system and the external environment is neglected.
3.2. Transient temperature and structural response to a single FEL pulse
Single-pulse transient thermal simulations for diamond are performed at the selected X-ray wavelengths listed in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes the results, which show that the temperature rise at all wavelengths remains below one-tenth of the melting point and that transient material damage is therefore negligible. In addition, the single-pulse photon flux thresholds corresponding to this criterion are calculated. At 1 nm X-ray wavelength, the operating photon flux is one-fifth of the threshold, corresponding to a sufficient safety margin, whereas at 4.4 nm and 30 nm the margins are tenfold. These results indicate tolerance to higher average and peak powers, whereas the flux is more important because it directly determines the local temperature gradient.
Table 2. Temperature rise and single-pulse photon flux thresholds of diamond at different X-ray wavelengths.

Wavelength (nm)	Single-pulse photon flux (μm−2)	Temperature rise (°C)	Single-pulse photon flux threshold (μm−2)
1	1.2 × 106	127	6.0 × 106
4.4	6.0 × 105	130	6.0 × 106
30	1.0 × 105	24	1.0 × 106
For diamond, a non-thermal phase transition to graphitization may arise from changes in the potential energy surface of atoms caused by electronic excitations [42]. An absorbed dose exceeding 0.7 eV/atom in diamond could excite more than 1.5 % of the electrons, whose transition from bonding states in the valence band to antibonding states in the conduction band induces graphitization. In the present calculations, the ionization fraction is 0.13 %, and the absorbed dose is 0.03 eV/atom, both well below the ionization threshold for graphitization. Therefore, graphitization is negligible under these conditions.
The detailed single-pulse temporal evolution of electrons and atoms in diamond is presented in Fig. 5. Within the first 400 fs after the arrival of the laser pulse, the relaxation of high-energy electrons and deep holes leads to a sharp increase in electron temperature, reaching approximately 1600 °C. Subsequently, electrons transfer energy to the lattice, and the electron temperature decreases within a few picoseconds. Before reaching equilibrium, the electron temperature undergoes a gradual decay, after which thermal equilibrium with the atomic temperature is established. Following a single pulse, the equilibrium temperature remains well below the melting point. To provide a more direct visualization of the atomic response, snapshots of 216 atoms from the diamond system under the 1 nm X-ray wavelength condition are shown in Fig. 6(a–d). These snapshots illustrate that the local atomic structure remains ordered and stable throughout the simulation period. Fig. 6(e) further quantifies the structural changes using the pair correlation function 
, defined as the number of neighboring atoms at a given interatomic spacing. With increasing temperature, atomic positions exhibit minor fluctuations, resulting in slight broadening of 
,. However, the peak shape and integral remain unchanged, indicating the stability of the diamond lattice. These observations suggest that single-pulse irradiation under the present operating conditions is insufficient to induce irreversible material damage.

The first peak at 1.54 Å corresponds to the nearest-neighbor distance in solid diamond at 300 K, followed by peaks at approximately 2.52 Å and 3.07 Å, representing second- and third-nearest neighbors. Minor positional fluctuations induced by thermal motion lead to slight peak broadening.

4. Pulse-by-pulse accumulation of the diamond grating under repeated FEL irradiation
While the coupled MD-TTM model effectively captures the single-pulse thermal response, further investigation is necessary to assess cumulative effects in the diamond grating under high-repetition-rate operation with ∼10 μs pulse intervals. This section first introduces the pulse-by-pulse transient thermal analysis framework developed using PyAnsys. The finite element model, along with the relevant material properties and boundary conditions, is then described. Finally, the details of introducing the post-pulse temperature into the model and the corresponding temperature evolution results are presented.
4.1. Simulation framework based on PyAnsys
The temperature evolution from a single pulse is highly microscopic and transient, and does not account for external heat dissipation pathways such as radiation and convection. A macroscopic three-dimensional thermal conduction model is therefore required to adequately evaluate heat accumulation in materials under repeated high-repetition-rate FEL irradiation. A similar approach was recently reported by Zhang et al. [35], which extended the simulation to include thermal deformation through finite element analysis. In comparison, the present study employs a more refined heat source calculation. Specifically, the MD-TTM model achieves a fidelity comparable to that of first-principles calculations. In this framework, the heat source is applied by directly assigning the initial temperature field to the material, with further details provided in the later section. As the analysis requires repeated simulations over multiple pulses, particularly the continuous reintroduction of the temperature field and subsequent solution, automated modelling and parameter input are essential to enhance efficiency and minimize error.
PyAnsys is a Python-based toolset for controlling various ANSYS solvers through scripting. PyMechanical is a component of PyAnsys and provides automated control of ANSYS Mechanical for tasks such as model setup, analysis execution, and result extraction. This functionality streamlines simulations and eliminates repetitive operations. The pulse-by-pulse transient thermal analyses in this section are conducted through PyMechanical, and the overall procedure is illustrated in the flowchart in Fig. 7. The geometric model, material parameters, mesh division, contact settings, and boundary conditions are first pre-defined to construct the finite element model. The maximum temperature obtained from the preceding MD-TTM calculation is extracted and used to generate the initial temperature distribution, which is then imported into the finite element model. Thermal analysis is performed to simulate the transient temperature rise, and the resulting temperature distribution serves as the updated initial condition for the next cycle. This approach is based on the assumption of linear superposition, as the temperature increase after an ultrafast FEL pulse occurs on the picosecond scale, which is much longer than the femtosecond-scale pulse duration. The simulation is repeated pulse by pulse until thermal equilibrium is reached, and the final temperature is compared with the material melting point.

4.2. Simplified finite element model and material parameters
A simplified finite element model of the diamond grating and its OFHC holder is constructed for the pulse-by-pulse transient thermal analysis, as shown in Fig. 8. The holder provides three interchangeable positions for grating placement, but only one single position is considered here as a representative case. Owing to the high mesh demand of transient analysis, the periodic apertures of the grating and the detailed structural features of the holder are omitted. These geometrical details have a negligible influence on the thermal response and primarily affect the mechanical behavior. Water-cooling channels with an 8 mm diameter pass through the holder, with a convective heat transfer coefficient of 0.005 W mm−2 °C−1 applied to their inner surfaces. Indium foils are placed at the grating-holder interface, providing a contact thermal conductance of 0.01 W mm−2 °C−1 to improve heat dissipation. The material parameters adopted in this study for the diamond grating and OFHC holder, together with those of the YAG:Ce scintillator used in the next section, are summarized in Table 3.

4.3. Temperature field introduction and accumulation results
The surface temperature at the FEL footprint obtained from MD-TTM is used as the input heat source in the finite element model. Along the axial direction, the internal temperature distribution is assumed to follow an exponential decay law:

where 
 is the linear attenuation coefficient. At 1 nm X-ray wavelength, the linear attenuation coefficients of diamond is 0.75 μm−1, as reported in the NIST database [61]. In the radial direction, the temperature distribution is represented by a Gaussian profile. Accordingly, the applied temperature field can be expressed as:
(10)
where 
 and 
 denote the beam spot center, which in this case is set to the grating center, and 
 represents the standard deviation of the beam size. The material temperature is assumed to rise instantaneously after FEL pulse irradiation, as the heating occurs on picosecond timescale, which is much shorter than the pulse interval. The temperature contribution from each pulse is treated as linearly superimposed after the arrival of the next one, with the temperature dependence of the specific heat capacity neglected. For the diamond grating, the temperature distribution under full FEL power is applied. The case of 1 nm X-ray wavelength is selected as representative, as it presents the highest thermal load.
The calculation is repeated iteratively until thermal equilibrium is reached. The temperature evolution at the center of the FEL footprint is presented in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9(a), thermal equilibrium in diamond is established within 3 ms, after approximately 300 pulses. For improved visualization, Fig. 9(b) shows the detailed evolution within the first 0.2 ms. The temperature exhibits successive sharp rises upon each pulse arrival, followed by a decay before the next pulse, consistent with the typical response of materials under repeated ultrafast irradiation. The peak temperature reaches 163 °C and then relaxes to 36 °C between pulses owing to the high thermal conductivity of diamond. Fig. 10 presents the spatial temperature distributions of the diamond grating at thermal equilibrium in the 30 mm × 30 mm region. Both the maximum and equilibrium temperatures remain well below the melting point, demonstrating that the thermal performance is sufficient for the operational requirements.

5. Steady-state thermal response
This section examines the thermal behavior of the diamond grating on a longer timescale under steady-state conditions based on the average FEL power. The resulting temperature field is compared with the quasi-steady-state equilibrium temperature obtained in the preceding section to provide consistency between modelling approaches. In addition, the thermally induced structural response is analyzed to evaluate the operational reliability of the grating. Because the grating contains micrometer-scale apertures, a submodelling technique is applied to resolve local thermal and mechanical responses with improved spatial accuracy. For the YAG:Ce scintillator, fine temperature patterns associated with its imaging characteristics are also captured by the submodelling approach.
5.1. Multi-scale submodelling strategy
Optical components in beamline systems generally range from tens to hundreds of millimeters in size. However, simulating micro-scale variations in temperature and deformation with conventional finite element methods poses major computational challenges. A mesh resolution of 1 μm requires millions or even billions of elements, making such simulations computationally prohibitive with current hardware. Using a reduced model alleviates the mesh burden but neglects realistic boundary conditions. This issue can be addressed through a general multi-scale modelling approach, in which submodelling enables both the incorporation of boundary conditions from the global model and the resolution of fine structural details. The concept is broadly applicable and is implemented in many commercial finite-element platforms, including COMSOL and ABAQUS. In this study, ANSYS Workbench is used to demonstrate the submodelling approach, while the underlying methodology remains transferable to other simulation environments. Fig. 11 illustrates the submodeling workflow for steady-state thermal and structural analysis in ANSYS Workbench. Results from the coarse global model are applied as boundary conditions to the submodel, ensuring consistency of external loads. The submodel is then solved to obtain refined results in the localized region. In the present study, this approach is particularly valuable in two aspects. First, it enables detailed evaluation of thermal deformation at the grating apertures. Second, since the FEL beam produces a micrometer-scale intensity pattern on the detection scintillator, submodelling enhances the accuracy of the predicted temperature variations.

5.2. Detailed finite element model with applied thermal loading
In contrast to the simplified model described in Section 4.2, a detailed model with complete structural details is constructed in ANSYS Workbench, while maintaining the same material parameters and thermal boundary conditions. Convection is applied on the inner surfaces of the water-cooling channels with a heat-transfer coefficient of 0.005 W mm−2 °C−1. The grating-holder interface is assigned a thermal contact conductance of 0.01 W mm−2 °C−1. For the detection scintillator not included previously, heat dissipation is achieved solely by radiation to the ambient environment without any water-cooling system. The ambient temperature is set to 22 °C, consistent with the initial system temperature used in the single-pulse analysis. The refined model of the Talbot grating and holder, together with the detection scintillator, is presented in Fig. 12. The smallest pitch of 30 μm with an aperture size of 6 μm is selected for the Talbot grating under the 1 nm X-ray wavelength condition. Directly modelling such densely distributed apertures in the global model with dimensions of 30 mm × 30 mm is computationally impractical, so the pitch and aperture size are scaled up by a factor of 20–600 μm and 120 μm respectively, as shown in Fig. 12(a). A submodel with dimensions of 0.51 mm × 0.51 mm restores the original pitch and aperture size for localized analysis, depicted in Fig. 12(c). For the scintillator, the global model illustrated in Fig. 12(b) has dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm. Similarly, a corresponding submodel of 0.51 mm × 0.51 mm is constructed, as presented in Fig. 12(d).

In this study, the analysis focused on the transmitted power density at a Talbot distance of 1, with consideration of the beam magnification effect. Fig. 13 presents the power density distribution on the Talbot grating and the detection scintillator at an X-ray wavelength of 1 nm. The coarse global model of the scintillator does not resolve the fine features of the intensity pattern, which are more accurately captured in the submodel.

5.3. Steady-state results and discussion
Three types of steady-state finite element simulations are conducted. The first evaluates the thermal response of the Talbot grating together with the associated equivalent stress distribution. The second focuses on the thermally induced deformation of the Talbot grating. The third examines the temperature response of the detection scintillator.
Fig. 14 illustrates the temperature and equivalent stress distributions of Talbot grating. The temperature peaks at the center and gradually decreases towards the edges, following the applied Gaussian-like power density distribution, as illustrated by the temperature field in Fig. 14(a). Despite the substantial thermal load, the maximum temperature remains 39 °C, indicating the effectiveness of the optimized water-cooling design in maintaining thermal stability. Under the same distribution, the submodel temperature aligns with the central region of the global model, as presented in Fig. 14(c). The equivalent stress distribution follows a similar trend, with peak stresses concentrated along the aperture walls, as depicted in Fig. 14(b) and (d). The global model predicts a maximum stress of 18 MPa, while the central submodel yields a lower value of 7 MPa due to the increased aperture density. These stress levels are insufficient to induce structural damage in diamond, thereby preserving the optical integrity of the sensor under sustained FEL exposure.

Fig. 15 presents the directional deformation distribution of the Talbot grating. In the optical path direction (Z), the grating exhibits a central bulge, with consistent results between the global and submodel, as shown in Fig. 15(a) and (c). The peak-to-valley (PV) deformation within the effective area is 13 nm. Diamond substrates are typically fabricated through successive cutting, grinding, and polishing steps. Polishing involves thermochemical polishing (TCP) followed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to achieve a refined surface finish. For large areas such as in the present case, the final PV error falls within the 10 nm scale. Therefore, the surface deformation induced by thermal effects is comparable to fabrication-induced errors and is unlikely to degrade the detector's performance under normal operational conditions. In directions parallel to the grating surface (X and Y), thermal expansion primarily affects the position and size of the apertures. Deformation patterns in both directions are similar in magnitude but differ in orientation. The global model captures deformation across the entire grating, as shown in Fig. 15(b), whereases the submodel highlights the edge regions of the effective area in Fig. 15(d), where deformation is most pronounced. Thermal expansion of the diamond substrate results in two aperture-level effects: a maximum positional shift of 18 nm and a maximum diameter reduction of 0.3 nm. Laser drilling of diamond substrates generally achieves positional and dimensional precision on the order of 100 nm, while photolithography offers precision down to the 10 nm scale. The simulation results indicate that thermal effects on aperture position and size remain within the range of fabrication tolerances and are negligible for system operation.

Fig. 16 presents the temperature distribution of the detection scintillator. The global model predicts a maximum temperature of 239 °C, as shown in Fig. 16(a), while the submodel provides a refined value of 183 °C with detailed spatial features at the central region, as shown in Fig. 16(b). This temperature level is acceptable for routine operation of the scintillator, which functions as a consumable component for X-ray to visible-light conversion.

Overall, the steady-state thermal analysis further confirms the reliability of both the Talbot grating and the detection scintillator within the Talbot grating wavefront sensor. These results also demonstrate that the submodeling approach provides an effective means of resolving localized deformations, stresses, and temperature variations at the micrometer scale.
6. Comparison of thermal modelling strategies
This work integrates three complementary thermal simulation approaches within a multiscale framework, each with distinct strengths and limitations. The single-pulse FEL-induced heating simulation accurately captures electron-lattice energy coupling and predicts temperature evolution and structural stability at the nanometer and sub-picosecond scale. However, its localized scope and high computational cost limit its applicability to larger-scale structures. The pulse-by-pulse accumulation simulation resolves heat accumulation in millimeter-scale structures and estimates equilibrium temperatures under high-repetition-rate operation. Its accuracy relies on the initial temperature fields provided by MD-TTM calculations and remains sensitive to mesh resolution, although the use of PyAnsys improves automation and reduces modelling effort. The steady-state thermal analysis enables evaluations of temperature, stress, and deformation in arbitrary geometries, with micrometer-scale fidelity achieved through submodeling. However, it does not capture transient or cumulative effects. The combined application of these three approaches establishes a comprehensive thermal evaluation framework and provides design-level insights for optical diagnostics in high-repetition-rate FELs.
Compared with the pulse-by-pulse transient thermal analysis, which predicts a quasi-steady-state diamond temperature of 36 °C, the steady-state thermal analysis yields a slightly higher value of 39 °C. The two results are generally consistent, as the steady-state condition represents the limiting case where the repetition rate approaches infinity and both models converge [35]. The minor temperature difference may be attributed to the lower grid resolution of the transient analysis, which is particularly restricted in capturing temperature variations along the optical path direction owing to the high computational cost. While the MD-TTM approach resolves the transient heating process with high fidelity, and the pulse-by-pulse model provides a self-consistent description of heat accumulation, the overall accuracy of the results remains constrained by computational resources. The high computational cost also prevents the pulse-by-pulse model from resolving the fine temperature patterns in YAG. As the scintillator functions as a consumable rather than a core optical component, steady-state analysis is sufficient for its thermal evaluation. Future work will incorporate deep learning techniques to enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency.
7. Summary and perspectives
This study provides a multiscale thermal analysis of a Talbot grating wavefront sensor designed for a high-repetition-rate soft X-ray FEL. Advanced simulations are conducted to investigate the transient and steady-state thermal behaviors of key components, namely the diamond Talbot grating and detection YAG:Ce scintillator, to ensure the structural integrity and operational reliability under extreme irradiation conditions. Cooling strategies including water cooling for the grating and ambient radiation for the scintillator are demonstrated to be effective.
Compared with traditional damage assessment models based on the melting dose, the developed single-pulse transient analysis integrates MD and TTM, incorporating MC simulations within the LAMMPS code to evaluate the temperature evolution, ionization effects, and lattice dynamics under ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The corresponding atomic process calculations are based on the Hartree-Fock-Slater method, which allows accurate tracking of structural evolution and provides temperature predictions with near first-principles precision. In addition, coupling the obtained transient temperature fields with finite element simulations extends the damage evaluation to high-repetition-frequency conditions. In contrast to conventional steady-state finite element analysis, this approach enables the determination of instantaneous peak temperatures after each pulse, providing more informative predictions of material response and potential damage. Furthermore, refined submodeling in ANSYS Workbench allows for the evaluation of micrometer-scale temperature distributions and thermally induced deformations, capturing detailed local features that are often neglected in simplified models.
Collectively, these methodologies constitute a comprehensive multiscale thermal evaluation framework for analyzing the thermal and structural response of diagnostic devices in high-power FEL beamlines, and provide practical guidance for their design and optimization under comparable conditions. Nevertheless, challenges remain for engineering implementation. Fabrication of high-quality diamond gratings represents a critical bottleneck, and robust mechanical integration together with reliable cooling strategies will be essential to maintain long-term stability. Further efforts will include the development and testing of a prototype Talbot grating wavefront sensor in practical FEL beamlines. Further efforts will focus on the development and experimental testing of a prototype Talbot grating wavefront sensor in practical FEL beamlines. Moreover, the damage mechanisms of diamond and other non-metallic optical components under actual FEL pulse irradiation, as well as fatigue-related effects, merit dedicated experimental investigation.
