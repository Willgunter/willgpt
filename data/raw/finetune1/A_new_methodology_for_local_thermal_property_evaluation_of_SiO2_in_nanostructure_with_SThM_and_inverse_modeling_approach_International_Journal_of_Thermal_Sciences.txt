Abstract
This article seeks to evaluate the local thermal conductivity of SiO2 at the nanoscale using the Wollaston microprobe through Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). By combining experimental measurements with Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling, the study aims to determine the thermal conductivity of silicon dioxide within an asymmetric nanometer-scale structure. The innovation of this work lies on one hand in the use of an asymmetric sample geometry and, on the other hand, in the implementation of a minimization-based inverse method (Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm) to extract the thermal conductivity. This combined experimental-numerical approach provides an enhanced understanding of the material's thermal behavior at the micro- and nanoscale.

1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of micro- and nanotechnology has spurred significant research into nanoscale heat transfer and the thermal properties of materials, particularly in semiconductor and electronic applications [[1], [2], [3]]. At these small scales, thermal transport differs fundamentally from macroscopic behavior due to size effects, surface interactions, and ballistic heat transfer phenomena. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in microelectronic devices, improving thermal barrier coatings, and enabling the design of nanoscale systems with tailored thermal properties.
Over the past several decades, a variety of experimental techniques have been developed to characterize thermal properties at the nanoscale. Electrical methods, such as the 3ω technique and bridge-based self-heating approaches, provide valuable thermal information but are limited in spatial resolution [4]. Optical methods, including thermo-reflectance and Raman spectroscopy, are constrained by diffraction, making them less effective for probing nanoscale structures [5,6]. To overcome these challenges, scanning probe microscopy (SPM)-based techniques, particularly scanning thermal microscopy (SThM), have emerged as powerful tools for nanoscale thermal characterization [7,8]. Among these, subsurface imaging using SThM has been successfully employed to detect buried thermal inhomogeneities by mapping variations in thermal conductivity and diffusivity. This technique enables localized thermal analysis of buried structures, making it particularly useful for studying composite materials and polymers, as well as materials with special nanostructures [9].
Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) relies on the interaction between a self-heated probe and the sample to extract local thermal properties. The most commonly used probes incorporate a resistive element at the tip, which serves as both a heat source and a sensor. By monitoring temperature variations in the probe, typically via changes in its electrical resistance, local thermal conductivity can be mapped across the sample surface. However, determining thermal conductivity from SThM measurements is not straightforward, as it does not provide direct conductivity values. The typical approach involves measuring thermal signals over the sample surface and comparing them with reference materials of known thermal conductivities, thereby establishing a calibration curve specific to the thermal probe based on calibration samples. This curve is then used to estimate the thermal conductivity of unknown samples. Several studies have adopted this method to perform quantitative thermal analysis using SThM [[10], [11], [12]]. In contrast, our novel methodology removes the need for such calibration samples: thermal conductivity values are extracted by combining experimental measurements with numerical modeling through inverse techniques.
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is a material of particular interest due to its widespread use in microelectronics, optics, and insulation applications. Its thermal conductivity plays a crucial role in determining its effectiveness in these fields. However, the thermal conductivity of SiO2 films depends strongly on the fabrication method. While various deposition techniques, including plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), have been employed to assess SiO2 thermal properties, there is limited research on the thermal conductivity of SiO2 films produced by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) [13]. Researchers such as Callard et al. [14] have employed SThM to study silicon dioxide films using local point measurements only, extracting their local thermal conductivity based on an axisymmetric finite element model of the tip–sample heat transfer. Their analysis established the relationship between the film thickness, the material's thermal conductivity, and the interfacial resistance, while Huang et al. [15] have used micro-Raman spectroscopy for non-contact thermal conductivity measurements in thin films. Guen et al. [16] used SThM to determine the thermal conductivity of a flat stepped structure made of SiO2 steps with several thicknesses on a silicon (Si) substrate. Their study provided effective thermal conductivity values for the SiO2/Si system as a function of SiO2 thickness. In contrast, this work aims to evaluate the local thermal conductivity of silicon dioxide in an asymmetric nanostructure, independently of substrate effects. To our knowledge, it is the first study to investigate a sample with such a complex nanostructure.
Other recent studies have employed advanced Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) and Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) techniques to investigate nanoscale heat transport in dielectric and semiconducting thin films [[17], [18], [19]]. These methods have provided high-resolution insight into phonon scattering and interfacial heat transfer phenomena. However, such approaches often rely on complex setups and stringent calibration procedures that limit their use in practical or non-standard geometries.
In contrast, the methodology developed in this work enables quantitative evaluation of SiO2 thermal conductivity using a robust SThM setup operating under less demanding experimental conditions. The Wollaston probe, recognized for its stability and robustness, its well-characterized thermal response, and its ability to provide global thermal profiles, proves particularly well suited for quantitative studies on complex nanostructures.
The article is structured as follows: the principle of Scanning Thermal Microscopy and the experimental setup are presented in Section 2; Next, we describe the methodology used to determine the thermal conductivity of SiO2 through combined experimental and numerical analysis in Section 3; Section 4 discusses the obtained results, including the proposed calibration process, sensitivity analysis, and evaluation of the SiO2 thermal conductivity through a new methodology; and Section 5 concludes the study by highlighting the relevance and applicability of the proposed methodology.
2. Experimental setup
Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) is a technique based on the principle of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), in which the measurement of local thermal conductivity or temperature variations across a sample's surface. This method allows the simultaneous acquisition of both topographical and thermal images at micro and nanoscale. The thermal information is ensured by the addition of a thermal control unit incorporating a Wheatstone bridge and a feedback loop to maintain the probe at a constant temperature during the scanning.
In this study, we used a Wollaston microprobe manufactured by the Czech Metrology Institute (CMI), operating in active mode to extract thermal information from the sample. The probe's thermal resistive element, fabricated through electrochemical etching, is bent into a V-shape at its tip.
It is composed of 90 % platinum and 10 % rhodium, with a wire diameter of 5 μm, a length of 250 μm, and a curvature radius of 15 μm. The Wollaston probe was selected for its robustness, ease of use, and well-characterized thermal response [20,21]. Although its spatial resolution is lower than that of modern microfabricated probes, it provides stable and reproducible measurements suitable for quantitative studies. It enables the acquisition of global thermal profiles rather than strictly local signals, making it particularly effective for evaluating materials with different nanostructures under accessible and easily controlled experimental conditions. The probe was operated in contact mode with a controlled low force, adjusted through the AFM feedback loop of the microscope. Repeatability tests confirmed that the applied force did not affect the thermal signal or cause measurable drift. The measurements were performed under same controlled ambient conditions, with the probe set to conductivity contrast mode. To reduce the effect of the water meniscus, the probe temperature was maintained at 100 °C [22] and the relative humidity was controlled at 45 %. A direct current of 50 mA was applied to the resistive element via the Joule effect. During scanning, the probe–sample heat flux was monitored through variations in the output voltage required to keep the probe at a constant reference temperature. Thermal images were recorded with a resolution of 256 × 256 points at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz.
Our focus was on investigating the thermal conductivity of SiO2 at varying thicknesses in a nanostructure. To this end, our laboratory designed an asymmetric sample geometry, fabricated by VTT in Finland as part of the QuantiHeat Project [23]. The sample consists of a SiO2/Si linear interface, buried under a 400 nm thick SiO2 layer (Fig. 1). This 400 nm layer was deposited using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. The SiO2 thickness varies between 400 and 2150 nm. This design allows for the assessment of local thermal conductivity at different positions, each corresponding to a specific SiO2 thickness, enabling the determination of thermal conductivity across these thicknesses. The thermal conductivity of the silicon substrate, with a thickness of 5 mm, is 130 W m−1 K−1.The experimental measurements were complemented by a numerical model to interpret the recorded signal, followed by the application of an inverse technique to evaluate the local thermal conductivity of SiO2 with thicknesses ranging from 400 to 1810 nm, according to the specific sample geometry.

3. Methodology
3.1. SThM experimental set up
The first step involves scanning the sample's surface under ambient temperature conditions. This process results in a thermal image (Fig. 2a), providing information about the sample's thermal behavior. A voltage profile is obtained along the a-b line drawn on the image (Fig. 2b). This profile is instrumental in assessing the heat lost from the probe to the sample. Therefore, this experimental profile must be supported by a numerical model that accounts for the various heat transfer modes involved. This will be further detailed in section 3.2

The heat transfer from the probe to the sample is observed in four distinct thermal zones (Fig. 2b). In the first zone, where the probe scans an area with uniform SiO2 over the Si substrate, the electrical signal remains constant. As the probe is near the edge of the triangular step (zone 2), the output voltage drops, caused by a decrease in heat flux from the probe to the sample due to an increase in the SiO2 layer. We observed that the probe starts detecting the presence of the SiO2 structure before actually reaching it. In zone 3, the electrical signal increases as the SiO2 layer thickness decreases and we can see that the variation is linear. In the fourth zone where the probe scans a region with uniform SiO2, the heat dissipation observed is similar to that in zone 1, as the probe encounters the same layer thickness. An unexpected bump can be observed in the profile; this feature will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.
The change in the electrical signal is attributed to the power dissipated by the Joule effect and the establishment of thermal equilibrium in the Wollaston probe. This behavior is key to evaluating the experimental heat flux transmitted from the probe to the sample, which can be compared to numerical models to determine the corresponding thermal conductivity. The shift from non-contact to contact mode indicates the total heat flux dissipated into the sample, which is measured via the probe's voltage. It is worth noting that at low current levels in the milliampere range, the electrical signal may exhibit noise. However, this does not impact the reliability of the thermal or electrical data measured.
The change in the electrical signal originates from the Joule heating dissipated in the Pt/Rh filament and the establishment of two probe distinct equilibrium states: non-contact and contact. The corresponding electrical power dissipated in the resistive element of the Wollaston probe is experimentally determined from the Wheatstone bridge output for both configurations, as expressed in Equations (1), (2).

(2)
Where Pwc represents the power dissipated in the probe due to Joule heating when it is out of contact with the sample in W, and Pc the power dissipated by the probe when it is in contact with the sample. The electrical current flowing through the probe when it is out of contact with the sample is denoted as Ipwc in mA, while Ipc represents the electrical current flowing through the probe when it is in contact with the sample. These powers are evaluated from Voutc and Voutwc corresponding to the probe output voltages in contact and non-contact modes, respectively in V.
To interpret their difference, we consider the thermal equilibrium of the probe in the two configurations. In the non-contact case, the dissipated power is mainly lost through conduction along the Wollaston wire and convection to the ambient air:
(3)
When the probe makes contact with the sample, an additional dissipation pathway appears at the tip–sample interface, leading to a new balance:
(4)
Qw′ represents the conductive heat flux from the Pt/Rh filament toward the rest of the probe, Qconv′ denotes the convective heat flux exchanged between the filament and the surrounding air in W, and Qs corresponds to the heat flux transmitted from the probe into the sample. The analysis of the two equilibrium states, non-contact and contact, shows that the conductive and convective losses remain almost unchanged between them. This is supported by the very small temperature variations observed for the Wollaston wire (≈0.6 K) and for the entire probe (≈3 K) [24]. In contrast, the thermosensitive element at the Pt/Rh filament exhibits a significant temperature difference of about 17 K, directly reflecting the thermal interaction with the sample upon contact [24]. Because the conductive and convective contributions are nearly identical in both configurations, they effectively cancel when the two equilibria are subtracted. Consequently, the resulting power difference, ΔP, corresponds solely to the heat flux transmitted to the sample, Qs, expressed as:
(5)
In the following, the Qs is evaluated through the numerical model and will be compared with the power difference ΔP in order to extract the local thermal conductivity of SiO2 for different thicknesses.
3.2. FEM numerical approach
A three-dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) models were developed in COMSOL Multiphysics. A dual-model strategy was adopted, each addressing specific aspects of heat transfer: first, evaluating losses through the probe holder, and then using this evaluation to simplify the probe representation.
The first model considers the entire probe with its realistic dimensions to determine an equivalent heat transfer coefficient, accounting for thermal losses through the probe holder. This coefficient is then integrated into the second model, which focuses on the interaction between the probe and the sample with a value of hequivalent = 84000 W m2 K−1. Both models incorporate various influencing factors, as detailed in Al Alam's thesis [25]. In the second model, the probe is represented by two cylindrical disks corresponding to the Wollaston element and its V-shaped Platinum-Rhodium wire. The thermal properties of all relevant materials, such as the Wollaston probe, silicon dioxide, and silicon, are properly defined in the numerical model. The thermal contact resistance at the interface was not considered, as its inclusion produced only a negligible difference in the computed numerical heat flux. For this reason, it was excluded from the main analysis. However, its influence on the estimation of thermal conductivity is further investigated in Section 4. Fig. 3 illustrates the probe–sample system, highlighting all applied boundary conditions. The contact is modeled with a surface area of 1 μm2.

The simulation of the probe's behavior employs a thermo-electrical coupling technique. This approach combines heat transfer and electric current equations within the FEM framework. By solving the heat transfer equation for the resistive element, which is heated via Joule effect, the model evaluates the heat flux exchanged between the probe and the sample during contact and when the probe is in ambient air. By developing the model and establishing the boundary conditions, the heat transfer equations (4), (5)) given below can be solved in steady-state mode, yielding a numerical profile of the dissipated heat flux at different probe positions relative to the sample. Running the model for multiple probe/sample positions enables the determination of the numerical thermal profile. We set the reference position of 0 μm to be 3 μm prior to the nanostructure.

V is the electric potential in V, σ(T) the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity in S.m−1, K(T) the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity in W.m−1. K−1, and ∇V the gradient of the electric potential in V.m−1. ρ is the volumetric mass density in kg.m−3, Cp the specific heat capacity in J.kg−1. K−1, and T the temperature of the thermoresistive element in K. The mesh was designed to capture geometric details at different scales while maintaining a good balance between reliability and computation time. The nanostructure was meshed with a fine resolution ranging from 0.1 μm to 1 μm, while the thermo-resistive element used a maximum element size of 1.5 μm. The rest of the sample was meshed using the standard size defined by COMSOL.
Comparing the experimental thermal profile, shown in Fig. 2b, with the heat transfer profile obtained from our computational FEM model in Fig. 3b, we reproduce the experimental behavior. The thermal response of the Wollaston probe is influenced by the nanostructure and depends on the thermal properties of the probed volume. As the probe moved across the sample surface, the thermal signal responded to the varying heat dissipation in each scanned area, demonstrating a clear correlation between the thermal signal and the sample's geometry, which reflects the underlying properties of the sample. In particular, we were able to identify the general position of the nanostructure along the thermal profile, as well as the specific location of the step edge indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 3b. This alignment between numerical simulations and experimental results underscores the reliability of our modeling approach in capturing challenges of heat transfer at this scale. Building on this achievement, our next step will focus on developing an inverse method to determine the thermal conductivity of SiO2. By integrating experimental data with the computational model, this method will enable us to evaluate the thermal conductivity of SiO2 across different thicknesses, further enhancing our understanding of its thermal behavior at this nanoscale. One can see in the numerical results (Fig. 3b) the bump observed in the experimental thermal profile (Fig. 2b). We referred to the numerical model, specifically to the temperature field at the probe sample contact region. Four points were selected along the numerical profile, as indicated in Fig. 3b. The corresponding temperature fields at these locations are presented in Fig. 4, which show the thermally affected zones. We chose to display the thermally affected zone only in the region of interest, while showing the rest of the nanostructure as transparent, to better visualize these zones.

Fig. 4. Temperature fields corresponding for four different probe–sample positions.

As shown in Fig. 4a, when the probe is positioned at the edge of the nanostructure, part of the heat is dissipated within the nanostructure itself, while another part flows through the Si substrate, leading to an increase in the temperature of layer SiO2 in particular. As the probe moves along the surface (Fig. 4b), the heat becomes increasingly confined within the nanostructure, resulting in a reduction of the dissipated heat. When the probe reaches the position shown in Fig. 4c, the heat flux rises again, forming the bump observed in the experimental thermal profile of Fig. 3b. This behavior can be attributed to the relative contribution of materials in the varying probed volume: due to the asymmetric geometry of the nanostructure, the probe locally interacts with a region having a lower proportion of SiO2, which promotes higher heat transfer at this position, while in the regions containing more Si, the heat diffusion becomes more extensive due to the higher thermal conductivity of silicon. Moreover, when the probe moves to the position shown in Fig. 4d, it becomes influenced again by the SiO2, where the part of SiO2 is higher than in the previous position, leading to a renewed decrease in the thermal signal. This analysis highlights that local variations in geometry and layer thickness strongly influence the measured thermal response, demonstrating the sensitivity of SThM to nanoscale structural asymmetries.
3.3. Implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm
We employed an inverse technique to evaluate the thermal conductivity of silicon dioxide material at variable thicknesses in a specific nanostructure. The idea is based on evaluating the numerical heat transfer evaluated by the simulation and comparing it to the experimental measurements in a way to extract the thermal conductivity at the convergence iteration (Fig. 5). By linking experimental measurements and numerical heat transfer, the method aims to estimate the thermal conductivity of the material. To solve the inverse problem, we employed the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

The algorithm utilizes sensitivity vectors to refine parameter updates, ensuring reliable convergence in the estimation of thermal conductivity. By combining the principles of gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm solves nonlinear least-squares problems, starting from any initial guess of thermal conductivity. The goal of this process is to minimize the error between observed data and model predictions. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameter and iteratively adjusts it to reduce the objective function. A key feature of this method is its ability to adjust the step size at each iteration. When the parameter is far from the optimal value, the algorithm acts like gradient descent. As it approaches the optimal solution, it transitions to the Gauss-Newton method [26,27]. In this study, we do not consider measurement noise, and the weighting matrix is assumed to be an identity matrix. The following chart, illustrated in Fig. 6, represents the iterative algorithm designed to evaluate the thermal conductivity of SiO2 material.

4. Results and discussion
Before applying the inverse technique, we first calibrate our numerical model. This calibration is based on a commonly known thermal conductivity for a given thickness. As mentioned earlier, the SiO2 cover layer thickness is deposited using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. We calibrate our model at a thickness far from the nanostructure when the probe is over the 400 nm SiO2 layer thickness. According to the literature, few studies address this type of deposition. Goodson et al. found a thermal conductivity value of 0.95 W m−1 K−1 for a thickness of 300 nm [28]. Later, Yamane et al. [29] reported the same value as Goodson, but for a 475 nm SiO2 layer thickness. Based on these studies, we chose to calibrate our model at 400 nm with a thermal conductivity value of 0.95 W m−1 K−1.
This calibration allows us to control the heat exchange radius, as shown in Fig. 7. The thermal spreading resistance RS, which accounts for both the bulk sample and the additional effect of the thin film thickness, is given by Ref. [30]:
(6)
where RS depends on the thermal conductivity of the substrate (Ksubstrate), the thermal conductivity of the thin film (Kfilm), and the thickness of the deposited layer (e). The heat exchange radius b is extracted from the analytical formulation of the spreading thermal resistance Rs; its values are b1 = 980 nm for the 400 nm SiO2 layer and b2 = 2.65 μm over the 1810 nm SiO2 structure, respectively [24]. These two values are in good agreement with other studies at this scale, showing a dependence of the heat exchange radius on material thermal properties [31,32].

The assessed thermal conductivities for SiO2 offer distinct perspectives on the material's thermal behavior, presenting different values for varying SiO2 layer thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 8. Each point on the curve corresponds to a thermal conductivity value obtained by applying the inverse method to both experimental and numerical results. The error bars represent the uncertainty, estimated from three independent measurements, and defined as the deviation of the mean value from the minimum and maximum values obtained.

As the silicon dioxide layer becomes thinner, its thermal conductivity decreases, which aligns with our expectations. Thinner layers typically exhibit lower conductivity due to increased boundary scattering and reduced phonon transport efficiency. For the thinnest measured layer (576 nm), the thermal conductivity is evaluated at 1.02 W m−1 K−1. As the thickness increases, phonon confinement and surface scattering effects gradually diminish, allowing heat transport to approach bulk-like behavior. This trend is clearly reflected in the curve of Fig. 8, where the conductivity rises steeply at small thicknesses before reaching a plateau beyond 1.4 μm, indicating that the phonon mean free path becomes much smaller than the film thickness and that bulk-like conduction dominates [33]. Between 1460 nm and 1810 nm, the evaluated thermal conductivity reaches approximately 1.38 W m−1 K−1, confirming the transition toward bulk behavior of SiO2. This evolution of the apparent thermal conductivity with SiO2 thickness is also consistent with SThM observations reported by Guen et al. [16], who demonstrated that variations in local effective conductivity primarily affect the heat-spreading volume under the probe rather than the surface topography. Such behavior is characteristic of dielectric thin films, where both nanoscale phonon confinement and local probe–sample heat transfer mechanisms govern the overall thermal response [16,34,35].
Our analysis yields squared error values ranging from 6.46 × 10−9 to 2.04 × 10−7. This error quantifies the difference between observed heat transfer values (ΔP) and numerically computed values (Qs). Smaller squared errors indicate a better match between observed and predicted heat transfer quantities. To further assess the robustness of the inverse algorithm, we investigated the influence of several imposed parameters on the conductivity evaluation, including the interfacial thermal contact resistance, the convective heat transfer coefficient, and the heat exchange radius. Testing literature-based values of interfacial resistance showed that its impact on the transmitted heat flux was negligible (≈0.3 %). In contrast, the convective heat transfer coefficient had a stronger influence: a variation of ±5 % caused about a 7 % deviation in the estimated thermal conductivity [23]. This is expected since convection controls the probe's heat losses to the surrounding medium, even at the nanoscale, directly affecting the energy balance and thus the inverse estimation. However, this influence remains within the acceptable error range evaluated by the inverse method. The evaluated heat exchange radius is in good agreement with studies that specifically aimed to determine this parameter. We noticed from the literature that each deposition method of SiO2 behaves differently and exhibits its own thermal conductivity trend across various studies [15]. Only a few articles [29] address low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), and we used their reported values for the calibration step. The agreement between the model and the experimental data, demonstrated by these minimal squared errors, confirms the effectiveness of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. It validates the reliability of our model and provides reliable estimates of the SiO2 thermal conductivity for LPCVD deposited layers across different thicknesses. The sensitivity study confirms the robustness and consistency of the method, showing that small variations in the model parameters have only a minor effect on the extracted thermal conductivity values. This approach eliminates the need for reference samples to establish a calibration curve for the probe, which is typically required for the evaluation of unknown material conductivities. The Wollaston probe has shown great potential for nanoscale thermal characterization. However, it is primarily sensitive to materials with thermal conductivities in the range of approximately 0.1–10 W m−1 K−1, making it particularly suitable for oxides such as SiO2, polymers, and other dielectric thin films.
5. Conclusion
This study underscores the potential of the Wollaston microprobe in SThM for investigating the thermal properties of materials at both the micro- and nanoscale, particularly for asymmetric nanostructured samples. Finite element modeling (FEM) effectively describes the heat transfer mechanisms within the probe–sample system and reproduces the experimental thermal profiles obtained from the thermal images. The application of an inverse technique, such as the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, provides a reliable technique for thermal conductivity, yielding consistent and reproducible results. The obtained thermal conductivities are influenced by the material thickness, revealing that the thermal conductivity of silicon dioxide decreases when scaled down to a few hundred nanometers. The proposed methodology requires only an initial calibration point to account for the heat exchange radius, without the need for a calibration curve based on reference samples. The Wollaston probe, known for its robustness, stable thermal behavior, and ease of implementation, ensures reliable quantitative measurements under accessible experimental conditions. Overall, this work demonstrates that, by combining SThM thermal measurements performed with the Wollaston probe and an appropriate modeling approach, the experimental results can be interpreted to characterize the thermal behavior of complex, non-symmetric structures. Furthermore, the application of an inverse method enables the evaluation of local thermal conductivities within such non-symmetric structures.
