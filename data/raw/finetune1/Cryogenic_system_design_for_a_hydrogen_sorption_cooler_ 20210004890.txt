e present the cryogenic design of Hydrogen Sorption Cooler, part of cryogenic chain in the
Planck Mission (ESA). This cooler has to provide for a period of about 2 years, continuous
cooling power at a nominal temperature about18K. Two independent astrophysical
instruments will be supplied with the cooling power of: 0.175W for HFI instrument and
0.95W for LFI instrument, and both need temperature stability as good as possible (actual
stability on ground 4mK peak to peak). We show different designs to reach this stability and
we present test results. The thermal performance of the liquid reservoirs for the instruments
was also tested, when re-oriented on three axes. No significant changes in reservoir
temperature were measured. A local heater simulated the heat load on each reservoir.
INTRODUCTION
In the cryogenic cooling chain for the Planck Mission,I, three distinct coolers are required:
Hydrogen Sorption Cooler to reach 18K (from Jet Propulsion Laboratory USA), Helium
Joule-Thomson Cooler (with mechanical compressors) to reach 4K (supplied by Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory UK), and an Open Cycle Dilution Refrigerator (OCDR) to reach 0.1K
(supplied by CNRS-CRTBT FR). A pre-cooling temperature in the range 50K-60K from
passive radiation in space is simulated with a Gifford McMahon (GM) cooler during ground
tests.For testing the cryogenic components of Sorption Cooler, the hydride compressor is
replaced by pressurized gas from a cylinder for injection gas and by a vacuum pump on lowpressure side. The major advantage of hydride compressor for the sorption cooler is that no
mechanical parts are in movement which require maintenance and a gas circulation
parameter uses only heaters and temperature sensors make the cooler vibration free.
The performance of Cold End is dependent of compressor parameters.
PRESENTATION OF COLD END OF HYDROGEN SORPTION COOLER
The gas driving from one compressor to another, through the cold end, is monitoring by the
check- valves, heaters and temperature sensors. A schematic of Planck flight Sorption Cooler
is shown in Figure 1:

When pressure in a sorption bed of the compressor reaches 50 atm., a check valve will be
open and the gas flows into injection line. When the pressure is lower, check-valve will close
and block the gas return into the bed. On low-pressure side when the pressure inside
compressor is lower than 0.4 atm, the check -valve open; if not the check-valve is closed.
The cold end was developed and tested for the following hydride performance parameters.
Injection pressure 50 atm, with a stability of 1%
Outlet pressure 0.4 atm
Nominal flow 6.5mg/sec (1% fluctuation)
Running continuously in close cycle during minimum 2 years.
Perturbation in outlet pressure from compressor are about 0.12 psia (6torr),

Joule Thomson expansion device
We choose to use a porous material to create the JT impedance needed 31. The porous
material is SS 316 produced by Mott Corporation inside housing made of 316L stainless steel. The pore size used in this case is in the range 0.5-1 microns, and all is sintered inside
the housing to create a stronger contact with the housing wall. To prevent any possibility to
displace the sintered plug the housing contains a small step at the end of plug. The porous
plug size is about 0.063" (1.6mm) diameter and in length 0.1" (2.5mm).

Figure3. JT design. The gray square inside is the porous plug installed
More detail on porous plug JT is given in reference [3].
The choice of sintered powder is due to its higher resistance to the particle contamination.
The weak point is that once contaminated with particle, the porous plug is almost impossible
to clean up. Installing particle filter in the line can prevent this process.
During normal running, the residual gas existing in the warm side of cooler (Ar, N2, water
vapor, carbon monoxide and methane produced by the hydride), can contaminate of JT. We
prevent this by installing a charcoal trap, on the thermal shield at 60K-50K temperature.
Liquid Reservoirs
Joule Thomson expansion produce a mixture of liquid and gas as a function of gas
temperature going into JT produce is in the range between 50% to 90% liquid. We chose a
design where the hydrogen mixture liquid-gas goes through three separate reservoirs; the
inlet and outlet of reservoir are on opposite sides.
Figure.3 Schematic of liquid reservoir, a) inside and b) outside with copper clamp
The reservoir size is a diameter 19 mm (34") and length 51mm (2" )for first reservoir LR1
and 127mm (5") for the second one LR2. The reservoir wall is SS 316L thickness 0.5mm
(0.02"). А copper clamp braised outside of reservoir as the interface between the cooling
power produced and the instrument heat load. The liquid is collected inside the reservoir by
copper foam. We plan to use copper foam to avoid any temperature gradient inside the
reservoir. A view of the inside and outside of reservoirs is shown in figure 3.
The difference in length between 2 reservoirs comes from the heat load required by each; the
first reservoir has to provide maximum 0.175mW since the second one has to supply
945mW. To reduce as much as possible a increase in pressure along the reservoir, this has 4
open channels of diameter 1mm made especially for gas circulation. The angle drilled for
these channels increase the exchange between porous foam with liquid running.
Extra liquid evaporation
In zero g, the extra-liquid produced can create temperature fluctuation on the Cold End.
The aim of this devise is to evaporate all the extra-liquid without over-heating the exit gas.
Two different devices were build and test.
The First Generation of liquid evaporator is a simple reservoir containing copper porous
foam. The heat is apply at the exit of reservoirs on outside side, and we measure the
temperature on both sides of reservoir; we expect to have liquid temperature on the inlet of
reservoir and a slightly higher temperature on the exit of reservoirs.
The inconvenient of copper is that we cannot create a temperature gradient along the
reservoir to have a stable interface controller.
Figure 4: one design of LR3: stainless steel wall and mixture of copper foam and mesh inside
The same 19mm diameter tubing is fill up with a mixture of mesh and copper foams, as
shown in figure 4 or with only copper foam. It stills in progress the test for outside tubing
19mm copper fills with copper foam inside. The heat applied on this reservoir is function of
temperature set up is the in following points
• Before JT the gas temperature should be around 37K when the pre-cooling temperature is
60K and around 33K when the pre-cooling temperature is 50K
• Temperature of the gas coming out from LR3 should be slightly higher then the liquid
temperature.
In order to accomplish both conditions we must not apply extra heat higher then cooling
power available, which can cause warming entire JT system. If the heat applied is slightly
lower than cooling power produce, the gas temperature going into JT decrease causing extra
liquid in heat exchanger and in time fluctuation arise on the reservoir temperature due to
extra liquid evaporation in heat exchanger (HEX) leading to control problems.
Any change in this temperature affect the flow rate of gas going through JT which affect the
cooling power produce and the outlet temperature.
A Second Generation of evaporator tested is what we call a discrete heat exchanger DHЕХ,
which has a double role of cold heat exchanger for injection gas (temperature in JT is 18K),
and evaporator for extra-liquid coming from the cold end. The evaporation is de-coupled
from the cold end. One of DHEX is shown in figure 5.
The extra heat is applied on the warm side of DHEX, far from the cold end to be able to
adjust the heat load without affecting the temperature reservoirs.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
Temperature gradient present on the reservoir due to heat load
When the maximum heat load is applied on each reservoir, for the same value of the outlet
pressure a temperature gradient build up on the interface. This value was measured with
reservoir in both vertical and horizontal positions and no important differences were found in
the measured temperature.
When the total heat load is applied, we observe a significant increase in reservoir temperature
due to increase in outlet pressure. In time this temperature will stabilize just a little higher
than the liquid temperature measured previously.
In figure 6 are presented the temperatures on first reservoir (LR1) with and without heat load
0.175W and the same parameters for second reservoir (LR2) at 0.95W

Temperature on the reservoirs when the LR1 and LR2 are oriented on 3 axes.
The only way to test the performance of reservoirs on the ground and evaluate the gravity
influence is to have it oriented about the 3 axes. In all these tests the separation between
liquid and gas will be along the gravity force and in any reservoir position, the liquid will
touch the reservoir wall. In zero g and with the heat load apply from outside of reservoir we
have to guarantee that any time the heat load will be uniforms distribute inside reservoir.
We show in figure7, as a function of orientation for each axe, the reservoir temperature
obtained when no heat load is applied on reservoirs.
Reservoirs are in vertical orientation, flow running in opposite gravity direction (a) compare
with same vertical reservoir orientation when flow running in gravity direction (b), the major difference is on the temperature fluctuation on reservoirs.

Temperature stability
Stability in temperature depends on the ability to evaporate all the extra-liquid without
applying extra heat in the system. In the case of first generation of evaporator the nominal
temperature fluctuation measured directly on outside reservoir are in the range 40-20mK,
depending of reservoir orientation as shown in figure 8. We want point out that in the real
case where an important mass load will be attach on the reservoir, the temperature fluctuation
will attenuated.
In the first generation of evaporator reservoir (LR3), we are obliged to control the
temperature with a PID controller.

The tests were for short times compared to the lifetime of cooler mission; longer test
stability will be done in a bread board model later this year.
In zero g, function of liquid retention in reservoir and in the connection tubing, the quantity
of liquid arriving in the evaporator can also change and no prediction can be done from the
any ground test. The heat is applied from outside.
The temperature reading is either on LR3, where we have a fast response or on the gas before
going into the JT. In the last case the response time is longer. The first signs of overheating
are seen on the warm side of HEX. The risk of overheating is that if the heat applied is higher
than the cooling power produced and we still trying to regulate at the same temperature we
will over load the JT and the entire cold end will warm up.
For the DHEX, the heat is applied on different location on DHEX. The temperature is
measured on both sides of inlet and outlet warm side of DHEX (see figure5).
The idea is to apply a constant heat to compensate the extra-cooling and stabilize a
temperature gradient along this DHEX.
The design is made to have a temperature control working only on/off. The temperature
reading can be in one point or for better understanding in 2 points: inlet and outlet of the
warm side of DHEХ.
We still analyzing this new evaporator and we present the some data obtained in figure9.

Figure9: a) temperature fluctuation when a nominal heat load is applied on reservoirs LR1
and LR2; b) temperature on the last two blocks of DHEX: in the warm side W and the
following block is C; second graph from the top is the heat apply on DHEX
Data shown in figure 9a) was for a temperature pre-cooling at 50K and an extra cooling
power was around 0.140W. On left side it shows temperature fluctuation on both reservoirs
(top-LR2 and bottom-LR1); on right axe we have outlet pressure fluctuation present in the
middle of graphs and all are function of time show in seconds.
We remark that we can stabilize or have a very smooth increase in temperature, for a given
heat load. When we decrease the heat load, this temperature is going down with a very long
constant time. We can choose the temperature range between which we can regulate on/off. Its better in order to avoid perturbation during the change in the heat load, to operate with a heat step as small as possible
The temperature range is correlated with the heat load step. For large temperature range we need to be able to decrease the heat load with a more important value than in the case of
narrow temperature range.
In the graph presented above, we remark that the temperature fluctuation on the cold end is
given almost by the changing in the outlet pressure. The hydride material has the capability
to keep a constant pressure for la large change in flow rate, so the stability when changing happens in heat load should be better.
The temperature was measure with LakeShore218. The thermometers used are cernox.
In this specific case we was looking at the maximum temperature, which can be reach on the inlet of DHEX. Once which this temperature reach 27K, it starts to affect the next level of
DHEX. In this case the heat apply was turn off from 170mW at 90mW. Waiting long time
the temperature will decrease again.
