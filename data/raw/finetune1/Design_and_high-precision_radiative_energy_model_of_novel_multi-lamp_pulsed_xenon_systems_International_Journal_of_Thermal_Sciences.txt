1. Introduction
Pulsed xenon lamps, with the advantages of short-duration highenergy output and broad-spectrum characteristics, have been widely
applied in the medical [1,2] and energy fields [3,4]. In the medical
field, pulsed xenon lamps have been widely applied in photothermal skin therapies and aesthetic treatments [1,5,6]. Clinically, pulsed
xenon lamp is mainly used for superficial skin disorders and skin
rejuvenation [7–14]. More recently, their utilization has expanded to
a broader range of energy-related applications, such as energy storage
and beyond [15–19]. Within the energy sector, their most prominent
application lies in solar cell material processing, where pulsed xenon
lamps play a key role in advancing solar energy conversion technologies [20–22]. Specifically, pulsed xenon irradiation enables effective
annealing of thin-film absorber layers and the sintering of printed metal
contacts, while minimizing thermal damage to fragile thin substrates.
With its efficient materials processing capability, pulsed xenon technology is expected to accelerate the large-scale manufacturing of solar
cells [3,4,20,21]. These capabilities provide significant advantages over

conventional furnace-based processes by reducing budgets, shortening
manufacturing cycles routes compatible with next-generation solar cell
technologies. However, as an incoherent light source, pulsed xenon
lamps exhibit strong beam divergence [1]. This characteristic hinders
precise control of energy delivery in energy-related applications, which
can easily result in degraded or even failed material performance, while
simultaneously increasing the overall fabrication cost [23–25].
In practical applications, pulsed xenon lamp systems are often extremely simplistic, typically comprising only the light source coupled
with a reflective cavity. In some cases, the so-called ‘‘reflective cavity’’
consists merely of a simple reflective backplate. Such a design not
only amplifies the inherent drawbacks of pulsed xenon lamps as highly
divergent light sources, but also, due to the lack of effective guidance
for the divergent emission, inevitably results in a significant reduction
in the system’s energy utilization efficiency. It is also noteworthy that,
whether in the energy or medical fields, the majority of studies focus
on single pulsed xenon lamp sources, with research on multi-source
pulsed xenon lamp systems remaining relatively scarce. At present,

systematic studies on the optical behavior, structural design methods, and engineering application potential of multi-light-source pulsed
xenon systems are still very limited. In particular, under multi-source
configurations, the effects of radiation superposition and structural
parameters such as the number, geometric dimensions, and spatial
arrangement of the lamps on the resulting energy field distribution
remain insufficiently understood in the existing literature. In summary,
the existing pulsed xenon lamp system designs have two main shortcomings: the first is a lack of effective guidance for the divergent light
from the sources, and the second is the absence of systematic studies
on multi-light-source integration.
Naturally, whether to optimize the structure of pulsed xenon lamps
to reduce inherent drawbacks, or to accurately predict their radiative
energy distribution for precise energy control [24,25] or avoiding side
effects in clinical treatments [26–28], there is an urgent need for precise
models to predict the radiation energy output in pulsed xenon lamp
systems.
Typically, there are two approaches for predicting the radiation energy of divergent light sources: one involves using commercial optical
software based on ray-tracing principles, while the other computes the
radiation energy distribution by solving the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) [29–34]. However, commercial optical software often relies
on external CAD tools to model practical application scenarios. This
dependence not only complicates the workflow and limits flexibility in
making modifications but also reduces the system’s ability to respond
efficiently to rapidly changing or complex operating conditions [35].
Moreover, the high cost of such software presents a significant barrier for researchers who are not specialists in optics. Coupled with
steep learning requirements and substantial computational demands,
these factors further discourage use by those outside the optics field.
Nevertheless, obtaining accurate solutions to the RTE is intrinsically
difficult because it represents a high-dimensional integro-differential
equation, necessitating the use of approximation techniques for numerical evaluation [36,37]. Consequently, determining the radiative energy
distribution from the RTE remains a complex task for researchers who
are not experts in the field, with beginners frequently encountering
mistakes or misapplying methods during the modeling process. The
Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique, as a well-established approach,
has been widely employed for predicting the energy distribution of
divergent light sources [38–40]. Moreover, predictive models based
on Monte Carlo ray-tracing typically offer high-throughput data capabilities, enabling rapid database construction and facilitating the
integration of advanced analytical approaches such as deep learning
in subsequent studies, thereby further optimizing system design and
enhancing performance. However, in previous studies, the accuracy of
Monte Carlo ray-tracing predictions of radiative energy distribution was
typically validated only at selected key points on the receiving surface,
with few investigations assessing the accuracy of the predicted energy
distribution across the entire spatial domain [41,42].
In this study, to overcome the structural limitations of conventional pulsed xenon lamp systems and meet practical application requirements, our research team has proposed a novel pulsed xenon
lamp system, comprising a closed reflective cavity, pulsed xenon lamp
sources, and a light-guiding structure. Meanwhile, based on the Monte
Carlo ray-tracing method, we developed a pulsed xenon lamp radiation
energy prediction model suitable for multi-lamp systems. Subsequently,
the accuracy of global radiation energy predictions was validated on
receiving surfaces at various distances. The model’s accuracy was rigorously validated through comparisons with commercial optical software,
demonstrating its reliability in predicting complex radiative patterns.
By exploiting the data generation capability of the model, we further
analyzed how source positions and structural parameters influence the
overall performance of pulsed xenon lamp systems, providing valuable insights into system optimization. This work provides a simple,
efficient, and practical approach to addressing the shortcomings of
conventional pulsed xenon lamp structures. In addition, a flexible,
user-friendly, highly scalable, and cost-effective predictive model was
developed to precisely control the radiative energy distribution within
pulsed xenon lamp systems, providing guidance for practical applications, enhancing production efficiency, and reducing the occurrence of
adverse events.
2. Model and method
2.1. Geometric model
In this work, the pulsed xenon lamp system adopts a geometric
layout, mainly consisting of light sources, a reflective chamber, and
a coupling lens, as illustrated in Fig. 1. As depicted in Fig. 1(b),
the configuration integrates a fully enclosed cavity combined with a
lens. The coordinate origin is defined at the cavity center. The light
sources have the radius of R = 3 mm and the length of L = 55 mm.
Accordingly, Two-light-source model is defined as 𝐿1
, 𝐿2 and 𝑅1
, 𝑅2
,
while Three-light-source model is defined as 𝐿1
, 𝐿2
, 𝐿3 and 𝑅1
, 𝑅2
, 𝑅3
.
The reflective chamber possesses a radius of CR = 7 mm and a length
of CL = 82 mm. The cavity outlet measures CAW = 9 mm in width
and CAL = 40 mm in length. The coupling lens features a width of LW
= 8 mm, with both its length LL and thickness LH equal to 40 mm.
The receiving plane, a square surface with side length SL = 60 mm,
is parallel to the xz-plane and positioned at a distance D beneath the
lower surface of the lens. In the Two-light-source model, the centers of
the light sources are located at coordinates (0, 0, 3.5) and (0, 0, –3.5),
respectively. In the three-light-source model, the centers of the light
sources are located at (0, –3.9, 0), (0, 1.6, 3.5), and (0, 1.6, –3.5).
In this work, at the initial step, photons are evenly emitted from
each light source. Then, the propagation of photons within the pulsed
xenon lamp system after emission is categorized into three sequential
stages: interaction with the cavity, interaction with the lens, and absorption on the receiving surface, as shown in Fig. 2. The first stage
corresponds to cavity interaction. Once a photon is randomly emitted
from the light source, it is first checked whether its initial trajectory
allows it to directly escape the reflective chamber and strike the top
surface of the lens. If instead the photon collides with the cavity wall,
the intersection point is logged, and its new direction is obtained using
the reflection vector. The updated path is then re-examined to see
whether the photon can leave the cavity. This loop continues until the
photon is either absorbed or successfully exits the chamber. The second
stage involves lens interaction. Here, the photon’s ability to either pass
straight through the lens to the receiving surface or undergo an indirect
transmission is assessed. The point at which the photon meets the upper
surface of the lens is recorded, followed by calculation of the refraction
vector to determine whether it can arrive at the bottom surface. If the
photon fails to reach the lower surface directly, it may strike the lateral
surfaces of the lens and experience total internal reflection. In such
cases, the reflected trajectory is traced iteratively until the photon either escapes or is terminated. The third stage corresponds to interaction
with the receiving surface. Once the photon exits the lens from the
lower surface, a new refraction vector is computed to check whether
it can strike the receiving plane. If successful, the photon’s impact
location is stored, and its energy contribution at that point on the
receiving surface is calculated. In this model, the geometric structure is
generated synchronously with the light-source model, with geometric
boundaries created based on predefined geometric parameters. The
specific details are illustrated in the flowchart.
2.2. Method
Building on the previously described processes of photon propagation and energy deposition, this study introduces a Monte Carlo–based
ray tracing method to intuitively and clearly simulate such a complex
mechanism. In the model, photons are uniformly and randomly generated within the geometric boundaries of the light source, with the

coordinate generation scheme illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Their emission
directions follow the distribution pattern presented in Fig. 1(d). The determination of photon coordinates and emission angles is governed by
Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. Specifically, Eq. (1) reflects the stochastic
nature of assigning initial photon positions on the light source.

In this framework, 𝜔 denotes the zenith angle, 𝜑 represents the azimuthal angle [33,34], and 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚5 and 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚6 are random numbers
generated within specified intervals. In the model, each photon is
assigned a wavelength randomly based on the experimentally measured spectral distribution. Specifically, consider the set of wavelengths
{𝜆1
, 𝜆2
, … , 𝜆𝑛
} with corresponding probabilities {𝑝1
, 𝑝2
, …, 𝑝𝑛
}, where
the sum of all probabilities equals one. The cumulative probability for
the 𝑖th wavelength is then defined by Eq. (3).
𝐶𝑖 =
∑𝑖
𝑗=1
𝑝𝑗
(3)
A random number 𝑟, uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1], is generated. If this number satisfies 𝑟 ∈ [𝐶𝑖−1, 𝐶𝑖
], the photon is assigned the
corresponding wavelength 𝜆𝑖
. In other words, the wavelength of each
photon is determined according to the cumulative probability interval
into which the random number falls. The specific setup of this model
is as follows. First, the actual spectrum of the pulsed xenon lamp is
measured. Based on subsequent experimental results, it is observed that
the spectrum of the pulsed xenon lamp remains essentially unchanged
during the pulse, representing a steady-state spectrum. Therefore, the
probabilities corresponding to different wavelengths can be set as fixed
values. In this model, the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm is divided
into 10 nm intervals, with each interval assigned a probability value,
thereby assigning the wavelength attribute to each photon. Although
all photons are modeled with the same energy, the probabilistic wavelength assignment ensures that different portions of the total energy
correspond to different wavelengths. Given that each photon carries an
identical energy 𝐸0
, the total energy 𝐸𝑖 associated with wavelength 𝜆𝑖

Here, 𝑁PHOTON represents the total number of photons emitted.
Eqs. (1)–(4) capture the stochastic nature of the photon positions and
emission directions in the pulsed xenon lamp, as well as its broadband
spectral properties and the associated spectral energy distribution, thus
laying a solid foundation for accurate Monte Carlo simulations. The
photon’s position can be expressed as given in Eq. (5):

Here, 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑃 denotes the photon’s emission coordinates, 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑉 represents its emission vector, and 𝑡 is the distance the photon travels before

both the reflective cavity and the light-guiding components. Within the
reflective cavity, photons are reflected, whereas in the light-guiding
elements (i.e., the lens), they may undergo refraction or experience
total internal reflection at the bottom or sidewalls. Since all surfaces
encountered by photons are regular geometries, the intersection points
and updated coordinates can be obtained by simultaneously solving
the photon position equation and the corresponding surface equations.

the total number of photons emitted by the light source. 𝜂 is defined as
the ratio of the energy absorbed by the grid cell to the incident energy

lamp system, and S is the area of a single grid cell in mm2
. In this
model, the receiving surface measures 60 mm×60 mm and is divided into
100 × 100 grid cells. To ensure a sufficient number of photon samples
while maintaining computational accuracy and efficiency, the concept
of uncertainty is introduced. The number of photon samples used in the
simulation is determined by balancing computation time against the
acceptable uncertainty level. The uncertainty is calculated according
to Eq. (10):

The model is implemented in C++ using the Visual Studio environment and does not require external modeling software such as CAD
for parameter adjustments, allowing rapid modifications to model parameters. Unlike traditional commercial software that demands manual
editing and separate execution for each case, this model supports automatic parameter variation and fully unattended operation, significantly
improving both efficiency and automation.

specified as 0.94 [43].
2.3. Experimental scheme
In this section, an experimental validation of the predicted radiative
energy distribution in both space and time is performed. The newly developed pulsed xenon lamp system was constructed with an aluminum
alloy circular cavity and a K9 glass cuboid lens. The xenon lamp,
supplied by Excelitas, was positioned such that its center coincided with
the origin of the coordinate system. The structural dimensions of the
experimental setup were kept identical to those used in the numerical
model. Because of the limited receiving area and the rapid variation
of radiative energy within a few milliseconds, direct measurement of
the energy evolution is challenging. Hence, the model validation was
carried out through a comparison of the corresponding temperature
fields. A high-speed infrared camera (TELOPS SPARK IR), operating
at a frame interval of 2 ms, was employed to capture the transient
temperature variations on the rear surface of an aluminum plate coated
with a black alumina layer. The emissivity of the aluminum plate is
set to 0.91. The aluminum plate measures 100 × 100 mm in size,
with a thickness of 0.5 mm, and is coated with a black alumina layer
approximately 8 μm thick. In the experiment, the pulsed xenon lamp
was operated at 170 kW with an 8 ms pulse duration. This power value
was calculated by dividing the energy emitted in a single pulse by the
pulse width. At the same time, a photodetector (PDA36a2, Thorlabs)

was used to record the changes in light intensity over the pulse. The
experimental arrangement for temperature measurement is shown in
Fig. 4. To minimize errors arising from any misalignment between the
pulse timing and image acquisition, the experiment involved multiple
measurements, which were subsequently averaged. For the spectral
measurements, a spectrometer (OCEAN SR, OceanOptics) with a 1 ms
integration time was utilized to capture the emission spectrum of the
pulsed xenon lamp. To synchronize the spectral recording with the
lamp pulse, the signal from a photodetector was used as a trigger during
the measurement. This indirect validation approach was adopted for
several reasons. First, it is difficult to obtain heat flux sensors capable
of responding to millisecond-scale thermal transients. Second, the irradiated area in the experiment is too small to accommodate a sufficient
number of sensors for accurately capturing the spatial distribution
of heat flux. Third, heat flux sensors inherently rely on temperature
measurements that must be converted into heat flux values. Fourth, the
front surface of the aluminum plate cannot be imaged for temperature
measurement because it is used as the heat-receiving surface during
irradiation.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Model uncertainty
As shown in Fig. 5, the computational accuracy and runtime of the
Two-light-source model and Three-light-source model were evaluated
for different numbers of photon samples. From Fig. 5(a), it can be
observed that in the Two-light-source model, when the photon number
is 4 × 107
, the simulation requires 61.552 s and achieves an uncertainty
of only 0.0384. According to Fig. 5(b), in the Three-light-source model,
with 6 × 107 photons, the runtime and uncertainty are 87.3786 s and
0.0296, respectively. Under the same conditions, commercial optical
software requires 243 s and 545 s, respectively. Both the calculations of
this model and those of the commercial software were performed on the
same PC platform, which is equipped with a 12th-generation Intel Core
i5-12500 six-core, twelve-thread processor, 32 GB of RAM, an Intel
UHD 770 integrated GPU, and an NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 discrete
GPU. The commercial software used was LightTools 2019. These results
indicate that the radiative energy prediction model developed in this

study can achieve rapid predictions of radiative energy while maintaining high computational accuracy. Furthermore, in line with the current
trend of constructing large-scale databases, this model can automatically and efficiently generate radiative energy distributions for a wide
range of structural configurations. In contrast, commercial software
relies on CAD and GUI-based manual modeling for each new system,
which significantly reduces the efficiency of database construction.
3.2. Comparative validation of radiative energy prediction accuracy
3.2.1. Two-light-source model
In this study, the commercial software used for comparison was
LightTools. Within the software, the geometric parameters of the pulsed
xenon lamps were set to exactly match those described earlier, while
the spectral parameters were derived from experimental measurements.
Photon behavior in the software included refraction, reflection, and
total internal reflection. For the two-light-source case, 4 × 107 photons
were used; for the three-light-source case, 6 × 107 photons were used,
consistent with the model. In terms of energy settings, the two-lightsource and three-light-source models were maintained at 120 W and
180 W, respectively, with each light source set to 60 W. Regarding
material settings, the lens material was specified as K9 glass.
Fig. 6 and 7 present a comparison between the spatial distributions
of radiative energy predicted by the two-light-source model developed
in this study and those obtained from commercial optical software
at varying receiver distances. The results in the figures demonstrate
that the predictions obtained by the two methods are in excellent

agreement. Moreover, both prediction results indicate that as the receiver distance increases, the high-flux heating region at the spot core
shrinks rapidly in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 7(a), with its shape gradually
transforming from a rectangular form into an elongated one. Meanwhile, the subsequent quantitative analysis in Figs. 6(b) and Fig. 7(b)
reveal that the average relative error remains at a relatively low level
(all within 3%), with a minimum value of 2.11% and a maximum
of 2.73%. These findings indicate that the proposed prediction model
achieves extremely high accuracy in radiative energy prediction for
dual-light-source systems.
Fig. 8 provides a more detailed view of the error distribution. It
can be observed that across different receiving surface distances, Here,
𝜎 denotes the standard deviation of the error, 𝜇 represents the mean
error, and m corresponds to the median error. the maximum standard
deviation of the errors is only 2.39%, while the maximum median error
reaches 2.33%. These findings further validate the high accuracy of the
proposed model and indicate that the error distribution is relatively
concentrated with minimal variability.
3.2.2. Three-light-source model
In the validation of radiative energy distribution for the three-lightsource model, the prediction model developed in this study continued
to demonstrate good accuracy in Figs. 9 and 10, with quantitative
errors in Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 10(a) remaining within 4%. The maximum
average relative error was 3.11%, while the minimum was 2.55%.
Furthermore, in the triple-light-source configuration, the phenomenon
of the core high-flux heating region shrinking rapidly with increasing
receiver distance was still observed in Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 10(a).
Fig. 11 presents a quantitative analysis of the error distribution. It
can be observed that the maximum standard deviation of the errors
is only 2.38%, while the maximum median error reaches 3.08%. These
findings indicate that the proposed model maintains excellent accuracy
and stability in predicting the radiative energy distribution of the
three-light-source system.
Based on the comparative results of the two-light-source and threelight-source models, the proposed predictive model demonstrates high
reliability in terms of accuracy while outperforming commercial software in computational efficiency. This model enables the rapid acquisition of energy distribution under practical operating conditions,
thereby supporting precise control of energy input during clinical treatments. Moreover, its high-throughput data generation capability provides a solid foundation for integrating neural networks and other
big-data analysis approaches for rapid prediction in future studies.
3.2.3. Experimental validation
In previous work, the accuracy of the model was validated using
commercial software. However, there are certain limitations in the
experimental validation. At this stage, experiments can only be conducted on a single-lamp model, with the lamp’s central position set at
(0, 0, 0) while all other geometric parameters remain unchanged. Due to
practical constraints, experimental validation of a multi-lamp system is
not feasible. The accuracy of the light source spectra in the model was
first validated, with the results shown in Fig. 12(a) and 12(b). It can be
observed that the spectral distributions of both the two-lamp and threelamp models closely match the experimental measurements. Moreover,

the experimental results indicate that the spectrum of the pulsed xenon
lamp remains stable throughout the pulse, exhibiting no significant
variation, which further confirms the correctness of the spectral settings
in the model.
Next, the model accuracy was further validated by comparing the
spatiotemporal evolution of the aluminum backplate temperature obtained from experiments with that predicted by the simulation. The
results are shown in Fig. 13. Fig. 13(a) presents the temperature
field distributions at 8 ms for both the simulation and experimental
measurements, both exhibiting a saddle-shaped pattern, with higher
temperatures along the shorter edges. Fig. 13(b) quantifies the errors
of the temperature field distributions at different time points during
the pulse. The presence of abnormally high relative error values in
the figure is primarily due to defective pixels in the infrared camera
measurements. The maximum average relative error is 8.6%, and the
maximum median relative error is 6.7%. These results further confirm
the reliability of the model.
To further assess the impact of the convective heat transfer coefficient on model predictions, the quantitative error distribution between
the model and the experimental results under ℎ = 0 W∕(m2
⋅K) is shown
in Fig. 14. The results indicate that variations in the convective heat
transfer coefficient have only a minor effect on the error distribution,

with a maximum mean relative error of 8.2% and a maximum median
relative error of 6.5%.
In addition, the measured peak temperatures and the simulated
peak temperatures under different convective heat transfer coefficient
conditions are provided, as shown in Fig. 15. It can be observed that
the peak temperature slightly increases when ℎ = 0 W∕(m2
⋅ K),
further indicating that variations in the natural convective heat transfer
coefficient have only a minor effect on the prediction results. This
phenomenon is likely attributable to the short timescale of the energy
transfer process, which lasts only 8 ms.
3.3. Influence of light source parameters on system performance
This section examines the effects of light source position and structural dimensions on system performance in both the two-light-source
and three-light-source models, with all performance analyses conducted
at a receiver distance of 2 mm. The power distributions of the twolight-source and three-light-source models are maintained at 120 W and
180 W, respectively. And each light source is configured with a power
of 60 W. Here, the cavity emission is defined as the ratio of photons
exiting the cavity and reaching the receiving surface to the total photon
count, while the mean heat flux density is calculated as the mean value
within the high heat flux region, defined as areas exceeding 30% of the
maximum heat flux density. This indicates that regions where the local
heat flux density does not reach the threshold (30% of the maximum
heat flux density) are filtered out during the calculation of the average
heat flux density.
3.3.1. Two-light-source model
In this section, we first examine the effects of variations in the
light source radius and length on system performance. As illustrated
in Fig. 16(a), the system performance gradually decreases with increasing light source length, with the photon emission efficiency dropping from 24.5% to 20.04% and the average heat flux density decreasing from 0.123 W/mm2
to 0.1 W/mm2
. As shown in Fig. 16(b),

with a gradual increase in the light source radius, the system performance exhibits a slight upward trend. However, the magnitude of this
change is relatively small, indicating a limited impact on overall system
performance.
Next, the effects of light source position variations on system performance in the dual-lamp model were investigated. Five different
source arrangements were considered, as shown in Fig. 17(a). The
light source position in combination 0 is consistent with the initial
model configuration. For combination 1, the light source centers are
located at (3.5,−1.6, 0.0) and (3.5,−1.6, 0.0). For combination 2, the
centers are at (0.0,−3.5, 0.0) and (0.0, 3.5, 0.0). For combination 3, the
centers are at (3.5, 1.6, 0.0) and (−3.5,−1.6, 0.0). For combination 4, the
centers are at (3.5, 1.6, 0.0) and (3.5, 1.6, 0.0). According to the results
in Fig. 17(b), the system performance is significantly enhanced under
Position Combination 2. The photon emission efficiency increases to
41.6%, and the average heat flux density rises to 0.140 mm2
. Fig. 17(c)
compares the radiation energy distributions obtained from the present
model and commercial software under this configuration, showing an
average relative error of only 0.93%, further confirming the reliability
of the results.
Further investigation revealed that, compared with the Position
Combination 0 configuration, the spot stability is improved under
Position Combination 3. As shown in Fig. 18(a), in the original configuration, the core high-flux region of the spot rapidly contracts into an
elongated shape as the receiving plane distance increases. In contrast,
under the Position Combination 2, the contraction of the core highflux region is significantly mitigated, maintaining a more regular shape.
To quantitatively characterize this feature, the ratio of the area with
heat flux density exceeding 70% of the maximum to the total spot area
is defined as an indicator of spot stability. The quantitative results in
Fig. 18(b) indicate that Position Combination 2 achieves a higher spot
stability (max: 0.8162, min: 0.6727) compared with Position Combination 0 (max: 0.735, min: 0.5568), demonstrating that the improved
system consistently outperforms the original one. After optimization,
the two-light-source pulsed xenon lamp system in Position Combination
2 exhibits higher heat flux density and a more stable spot pattern. These

characteristics make this configuration more suitable for applications
such as solar cell materials. At the same time, the uniform and highenergy-density spot enables efficient and safe photothermal treatment
of the skin, reducing clinical risks associated with uneven heat flux
distribution.
3.3.2. Three-light-source model
In this section, the impact of variations in light source structural
parameters on system performance is further examined. The analysis is carried out from two perspectives: (i) uniform variations of
the structural parameters, and (ii) differential variations among the
structural parameters. The influence of uniform variations in light
source structural parameters on system performance is illustrated in
Fig. 19. As shown in Fig. 19(a), an increase in light source length
leads to a gradual decline in system performance, which is consistent
with the results of the two-light-source model. The cavity emission
decreased from 41.9% to 29.8%, while the average heat flux density
dropped from 0.21 W∕mm2
to 0.15 W∕mm2
. In contrast, Fig. 19(b)
demonstrates that in the three-light-source system, an increase in light
source radius also results in a performance decline. Although the
magnitude of this variation is relatively small, the trend is entirely
opposite to that observed in the two-light-source model (Fig. 16(b).
This discrepancy may be attributed to the different configurations of
light source positions between the two models. The cavity emission

configuration.
decreases from 39.2% to 35.8%, while the average heat flux density
drops from 1.99 W∕mm2
to 1.81 W∕mm2
. Combined with the results in
Fig. 16 and 19, it can be observed that, under the current evaluation
metrics, the system performance is more sensitive to variations in the
light source length.
The subsequent analysis focuses on differential variations of light
source structural parameters. Fig. 20 presents the results for variations
in light source length. The left panel illustrates the case of a ‘‘two-short
one-long’’ configuration, in which 𝐿1 gradually increases while 𝐿2 and
𝐿3 decrease. Under this condition, both photon emissivity and average
heat flux density show a progressive increase; however, the improvement is less pronounced compared with that observed in Fig. 19(a).
The cavity emission slightly increases from 35.7% to 36.9%, while the
average heat flux density rises from 1.80 W∕mm2
to 1.86 W∕mm2
. In
contrast, the right panel of Fig. 20 depicts the ‘‘two-long one-short’’ configuration, where 𝐿1 decreases while 𝐿2 and 𝐿3
increase. In this case,
the effect on system performance is negligible, with photon emissivity
and average heat flux density gradually decreasing. The cavity emission
slightly decreases from 35.6% to 35.2%, while the average heat flux
density shows a minor reduction from 1.80 W∕mm2
to 1.78 W∕mm2
.
Fig. 21 illustrates the effect of differential variations in light source
radius on system performance. The left panel of Fig. 21 illustrates
the effect on system performance when the radius of the lower light
source is gradually increased while the upper light source radius
remains unchanged. The cavity emission gradually decreases from
37.3% to 35.7%, while the average heat flux density declines from
1.89 W∕mm2
to 1.80 W∕mm2
. The right panel of Fig. 21 illustrates the
effect on system performance when the radius of the upper light source
is gradually increased while the lower light source radius remains
unchanged. The cavity emission decreases from 37.5% to 35.8%, while
the average heat flux density drops from 1.90 W∕mm2
to 1.81 W∕mm2
.
Taken together with the results from Figs. 19–21, these findings indicate that breaking parameter uniformity generally yields only marginal
improvements or may even lead to negative effects. Therefore, uniform
light source parameters are generally a better choice when configuring
the system.
The following section further discusses the effects of simultaneous
variations in multiple parameters on system performance. Specifically,
𝑅 gradually increased from 1.1 mm to 3 mm, while 𝐿 gradually
decreased from 54 mm to 35 mm. During this process, the cavity
efficiency increased from 38.2% to 41.3%, and the average heat flux
density increased from 1.94 W/mm2
to 2.09 W/mm2
. Combined with
the previous results, it can be seen that increasing the lamp radius
alone leads to a decline in system performance. However, during the
simultaneous variation of 𝑅 and 𝐿, system performance consistently
improved, indicating that system performance is more sensitive to the
lamp length (see Fig. 22).

From the above results, it can be observed that the system performance is highly sensitive to variations in the light source size
parameters. Suggesting that the degree of compatibility between the
cavity aperture size and the light source size is likely the key factor
influencing system performance.
3.4. Influence of cavity aperture size dimensions on system performance
This section examines the effects of the cavity aperture length
and width on system performance, with all analyses conducted at a
receiver distance of 2 mm. The definitions of the system performance
parameters — cavity emission and average heat flux density — are
consistent with those previously described. Notably, for the two-lightsource model discussed here, the light source centers are set to the
optimized coordinates (0.0, −3.5, 0.0) and (0.0, 3.5, 0.0). The power
settings for the two-light-source and three-light-source systems are
maintained at 120 W and 180 W, respectively. Except for the aperture
and lens dimensions, which vary with the cavity opening size, all other
geometric parameters remain consistent with those described in the
model introduction. Here, both the aperture length and width refer to
the half-value. The threshold for calculating the mean heat flux density
are likewise set to 30% of the maximum heat flux density.
3.4.1. Cavity aperture length
This section investigates the influence of cavity aperture size on
system performance. The analysis first focuses on the effect of aperture length in the Two-light-source model in Fig. 23. The results
indicate that with increasing aperture length, the photon emission
understandably increases, whereas the average heat flux density gradually decreases. As shown in the subfigure, photon emission improves
by approximately 70%, while the average heat flux density decreases
from 0.162 W∕mm2
to 0.124 W∕mm2
, representing a 23% reduction.
To achieve a balance between photon emission and average heat flux
density, the cavity half-aperture length should be set to 18.5 mm.
Fig. 24 illustrates the variation of system performance with cavity
aperture length in the three-light-source model. The results show that
photon emission continues to increase rapidly with aperture length,
while the average heat flux density gradually decreases but with a much
smoother trend, remaining within a variation range of less than 20%.
The maximum average heat flux density is 0.189 W∕mm2
, and the maximum cavity emission is 0.454. Notably, to achieve a balance between
photon emission and average heat flux density, the optimal aperture
length should be set at approximately 20 mm, further confirming the
rationality of the modeling parameters adopted in this study.
3.4.2. Cavity aperture width
This section investigates the effect of cavity aperture width on system performance. The performance variations of the Two-light-source
system at different aperture widths are shown in Fig. 25. Interestingly,
the average heat flux density exhibits a fluctuating downward trend
with increasing aperture width, the maximum heat flux density is
0.174 W∕mm2
. And the amplitude of the fluctuations gradually decreases toward stability. Meanwhile, the system emissivity generally
increases with the aperture width, at an aperture width of 5.8 mm,
the cavity emission reaches its peak value of 0.462; however, a slight
decline is observed when the width reaches 6 mm. indicating that an
excessively large aperture reduces the effective reflective area, causing
the light to diverge excessively and preventing efficient transmission to
the receiving surface. The performance of the Three-light-source system
at different cavity aperture widths is illustrated in Fig. 26. The average

heat flux density within the high heat flux region also exhibits a regular
fluctuating downward trend, the maximum average heat flux density
is 0.195 W∕mm2
. while the cavity emissivity increases with aperture
width but with a progressively decreasing growth rate. The maximum
cavity emission is 0.403. Notably, in the three-light-source system, the
fluctuation amplitude of emissivity is greater than that observed in the
two-light-source system. Similarly, to balance emissivity and average
heat flux density, the cavity aperture width should be set within the
range of 3.5–4.0 mm. This finding further supports the rationality of
the proposed model.
To investigate the underlying cause of this fluctuation, the variation
of the high heat flux region area with aperture width was further
analyzed, as shown in Fig. 27 and 28, Fig. 27(a) and 28(a) present the
variations of the high heat flux region area and its average heat flux
density with cavity aperture width in the Two-light system and Threelight-source system, respectively. The area of the high heat flux region
shows a stepwise increasing trend. Combined with the results in Fig.
25 and 26, it can be inferred that this behavior leads to the fluctuating
decline in the average heat flux density. The normalized results in Fig.
27(b) and 28(b) further reveal the stepwise variation of the high heat
flux region and clarify the origin of the periodic fluctuations in its
average heat flux density.
To further investigate the stepwise variation in the area of the
high heat flux region, this section examines the trend in the area of
the high heat flux region as the threshold for its calculation varies,
with the results shown in Fig. 29(a) and 30(a) show the changes in
the area of the high heat flux region for the two-light-source and
three-light-source models under different calculation thresholds. It can
be observed that, as the threshold gradually decreases, the stepwise
variations in the region area are eliminated. The normalized results in
Fig. 29(b) and 30(b) further illustrate that the area transitions from
stepwise changes to a smooth variation. Based on these results, it can be
preliminarily inferred that the stepwise variation in the high heat flux
region observed earlier is caused by the emission of photons from the
lower surface of the lens predominantly at small angles. This leads to
a slow increase in heat flux density around the periphery of the spot—
although the flux increases, it does not reach the calculation threshold
and is thus filtered out when computing the area. Only after multiple
accumulations does the flux reach the threshold, ultimately resulting in
the abrupt increase in the high heat flux region area.
To verify the aforementioned hypothesis, cases with an aperture
width of 4.4–5.0 mm were selected, and the angular distribution of
photons emitted from the lower surface of the lens was quantitatively
analyzed. Fig. 31 and 32 present the distributions and quantitative
results of photon emission angles under the aforementioned conditions.
Fig. 31(a) and 32(a) show the emission angle distributions for the
two-light-source and three-light-source models, respectively, indicating
that photons are primarily concentrated within a small-angle range
of 15◦–50◦
. The quantitative results in Fig. 31(b) and 32(b) further
confirm this observation: in the two-light-source model, when the

aperture width is 5 mm, the maximum mean emission angle is 34.2◦
,
and the maximum median emission angle is 33.2◦
. Moreover, across the
four examined conditions, both the mean and median emission angles
remain approximately on the same level, suggesting that variations in
aperture width have minimal impact on the emission angles. A similar
trend is observed in the three-light-source model, with a maximum
mean emission angle of 34.4◦ and a maximum median emission angle
of 33.6◦
. The results in Fig. 31 and 32 confirm the previous hypothesis:
since photons are emitted predominantly at small angles, the heat flux
density in the peripheral regions of the spot increases slowly. Only
after multiple accumulations does it reach the calculation threshold
and is included in the area computation. This mechanism explains the
observed stepwise and discontinuous changes in the high flux region
area.
Next, the variation of the global light spot with the cavity aperture width under different operating conditions was analyzed. The
global light spot area is defined as the region where the heat flux
density is greater than zero and is included in the area calculation.
As shown in Fig. 33(a), the two-light-source (No. 0) and three-lightsource systems with the original source arrangement exhibit relatively
concentrated and uniform global light spots, whereas the optimized
two-light-source system (No. 2) shows a more divergent and elongated
light spot along the 𝑋-axis. Fig. 33(b) presents the quantified results
of the light spot area variation. The optimized two-light-source system
reaches a maximum light spot area of 1125.7 mm2
, whereas under the
same conditions, the original two-light-source and three-light-source
systems have areas of 937.08 mm2 and 887.4 mm2
, respectively, corresponding to differences of 16.6% and 21.2%. This further indicates that
the energy distribution of the optimized two-light-source model is more
divergent. From a practical application perspective, this characteristic
is a disadvantage.
Based on the above discussion, the initial two-light-source model
exhibited a slightly lower emissivity than the three-light-source model
due to suboptimal source placement. After optimizing the source positions, the emissivity increased from 31.2% to 41.6%, surpassing the
34.6% achieved by the three-light-source model. From the perspective
of energy utilization efficiency, the optimized dual-lamp model may
represent a more favorable configuration. However, the optimized twolight-source model exhibits a more divergent and elongated spatial
energy distribution, whereas both the three-light-source model and the
original two-light-source model show a more concentrated and uniform
energy pattern. In practical manufacturing applications, a well-focused
and uniform energy distribution is generally more desirable. From this
perspective, the three-light-source pulsed xenon lamp system, with its
higher energy output and more regular spot pattern, enables precise
delivery of high heat flux to the target processing area while avoiding
energy input to unnecessary regions, making it particularly suitable
for manufacturing processes that require accurate thermal control.
Moreover, to achieve a balance between emissivity and average heat

flux density, the cavity aperture length and width should be set in the
ranges of 15–20 mm and 3.5–4 mm, respectively.
In summary, this study proposes a novel multi-source pulsed xenon
lamp system, which can effectively enhance the energy utilization
efficiency and reduce beam divergence. In addition, a Monte Carlo raytracing coupled model suitable for multi-source systems was developed
to achieve spatiotemporal synchronous prediction of radiative energy.
Based on this model, the effects of various parameters, such as geometric configurations and source arrangements, on system performance
were systematically investigated. However, the model has certain limitations, as it can only predict the radiative energy distribution on
regular surfaces and cannot be applied to complex curved surfaces.

4. Conclusion
At present, Pulsed xenon lamps have been widely applied in fields
such as energy and medicine. However, existing pulsed xenon lamp
system designs suffer from multiple structural shortcomings, which hinder the effective guidance of the divergent light emitted by the lamps,
resulting in low energy utilization efficiency. In addition, current systems typically employ a single light source, with little exploration of
the performance of multi-light-source configurations. And in multilight-source systems, a comprehensive understanding of how lamp
geometry, spatial arrangement, and overall structural parameters interact to influence system performance is still lacking, and systematic
investigations on these coupled effects remain scarce. Moreover, there
is a lack of simple and efficient predictive models for radiative energy,
which are needed to guide the practical use of pulsed xenon lamps
in production and applications. To overcome these limitations, this
study first developed a novel multi-source pulsed xenon lamp system,
designed to achieve effective guidance of the divergent light. The
system consists of a closed reflective cavity, pulsed xenon lamp sources,
and a light-guiding structure. In addition, a radiative energy prediction
model for multi-lamp systems was constructed based on ray-tracing
Monte Carlo simulations. The model was employed to predict the
spatial distribution of radiative energy in both the two-light-source and
three-light-source systems. Based on this model, the effects of multisource geometric parameters, spatial arrangement, and overall system
structure on system performance were also investigated. Comparison
with commercial optical software showed that the prediction error of
radiative energy distribution was within 4%. Additional experimental
results further supported and confirmed the accuracy and reliability
of the proposed model. Based on data generated by this model, the
effects of lamp radius and length on the performance of the two-lightsource system were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of lamp

position was examined, when the lamp centers were positioned at (0.0,
−3.5, 0.0) and (0.0, 3.5, 0.0), the system performance was significantly
improved. However, the optimized two-light-source system exhibits a
more divergent global light spot distribution. In the three-light-source
system, the effect of uniform variation in lamp dimensions on system
performance was first investigated. Subsequently, the impact of heterogeneous variations in lamp dimensions was examined. The analysis
showed that breaking parameter uniformity typically results in only
minor improvements or can even have negative effects, indicating that
uniform light source parameters are generally the better choice when
configuring the system. The analysis showed that breaking parameter
uniformity typically results in only minor improvements or can even
have negative effects, indicating that uniform light source parameters
are generally the better choice when configuring the system. Then, the
influence of cavity aperture size on system performance was further
investigated. The results indicated that, in order to balance system

emissivity and average heat flux density, the cavity aperture length
should be set within the range of 15–20 mm. A balance between
emissivity and average heat flux density can be achieved when the
cavity aperture width is within the range of 3.5–4 mm. In summary, this
study offers a novel approach to mitigating the inherent limitations of
pulsed xenon lamps and holds promise for providing technical guidance
and data support in their practical applications and structural design,
thereby enhancing production efficiency and reducing the incidence of
adverse events during use
