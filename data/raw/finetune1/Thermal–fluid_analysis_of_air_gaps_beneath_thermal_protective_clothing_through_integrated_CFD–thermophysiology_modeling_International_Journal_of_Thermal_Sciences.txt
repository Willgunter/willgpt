Abstract
This study presents a novel thermal–fluid analysis framework that fully integrates computational fluid dynamics with human thermophysiology to evaluate the influence of air gaps beneath thermal protective clothing on burn risk during flash fire exposure. The proposed fabric–air gap–human body model incorporates metabolic heat production and blood perfusion across multi-layered human tissues, effectively capturing the interactions among airflow, heat transfer, and thermal injury mechanisms. Validation against experimental data demonstrated high predictive accuracy for both skin temperature and heat flux. Simulations were conducted for various air gap configurations, varying in thickness (6.4 mm–12.5 mm), orientation (horizontal or vertical), and fabric wrinkle severity to represent realistic wear conditions. The results indicate that incorporating thermophysiological features accelerates skin burn onset by 15 %. Increasing air gap thickness improves thermal protection; for example, thicker air gaps reduced skin temperature by over 10 °C within 10 s of exposure. Vertical air gaps consistently provide superior protection by promoting buoyancy-driven displacement of heated air and mitigating convective heat transfer to the skin. In contrast, fabric wrinkles significantly compromise protective performance by increasing both radiative and convective heat fluxes. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for enhancing the design of thermal protective clothing by ensuring sufficient air gap thickness, minimizing fabric wrinkling, and facilitating vertical ventilation to mitigate burn risk.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Thermal protective clothing is designed to shield wearers from extreme heat and flame exposure, conditions commonly encountered in firefighting, rescue operations, and high-temperature industrial environments [1]. Its primary function is to minimize heat transfer from external heat sources to the human body, thereby reducing the risk of severe skin burns [2]. Over recent decades, advancements in smart textile, innovative coatings, and improved material systems have significantly enhanced the performance and comfort of modern thermal protective clothing [3,4].
Despite these advancements, a critical zone exists between the protective clothing and the human skin—commonly referred to as the air gap—that plays a pivotal role in thermal protection [5]. In many scenarios, the air gap acts as an insulating layer, slowing heat transfer from the external environment to the body. Under intense heat exposure conditions (e.g., flash fires), heat transfer within the air gap can significantly affect the temperature rise at the skin surface [6]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of flow and heat transfer mechanisms within the air gap is essential for optimizing the design and performance of thermal protective clothing.
1.2. Literature review
The geometry of the air gap—particularly its thickness, distribution, and orientation—varies considerably in real scenarios [7]. Air gap thickness can range from less than 1 mm in tight-fitting areas, such as around wrists or collars, to more than 20 mm in looser-fitting regions, such as around the torso [8]. Factors such as wearer movement, garment stiffness, and the presence of fabric wrinkles or folds contribute to geometric irregularities in clothing [9], leading to a heterogeneous air gap distribution. Additionally, the air gap exhibits directionality, existing in both horizontal and vertical orientations. Vertical gaps along the limbs or torso can induce buoyancy-driven airflow, while horizontal gaps, such as those over the shoulders, may display distinct circulation patterns and temperature gradients [10].
Heat transfer through the air gap involves a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation [11]. Under fire exposure conditions, radiative heat transfer from flames and hot surfaces often dominates [12,13]. Convection becomes significant when steep temperature gradients develop within the air gap, a phenomenon commonly observed during fire exposure [14]. Conduction plays a crucial role in scenarios where the air gap is narrow or temperature gradients are moderate. These heat transfer mechanisms interact dynamically. Their behavior is further influenced by fabric wrinkles and folds, which introduce local irregularities [15].
Various approaches have been employed to model localized heat transfer within the fabric–air gap–skin system. A common method treats this system as a rectangular or cubic enclosure. This simplification allows the use of semi-empirical correlations and view-factor methods to estimate convective and radiative heat transfer [16,17]. However, although this approach reduces computational complexity, its accuracy is often compromised. Local geometric features—such as fabric wrinkles and folds—can distort airflow patterns and disrupt the uniform distribution of radiative heat flux across the air gap [18,19].
In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a powerful tool for simulating the coupled flow and heat transfer phenomena within the fabric–air gap–skin system. CFD offers high spatial and temporal resolution. It can accurately capture local temperature gradients, velocity profiles, and radiative heat exchange [20,21]. Additionally, CFD can accommodate complex boundary conditions, including wrinkled fabrics, non-uniform air gap distributions, and time-varying external heat fluxes. By adjusting geometric details, CFD facilitates parametric studies, providing valuable insights that can lead to the performance-optimized designs [22,23].
Despite its demonstrated feasibility and advantages, existing CFD-based studies on thermal protective performance exhibit notable limitations. Most previous research has focused on replicating bench-scale tests. In these tests, standardized apparatus is used, comprising a flame source, a fabric sample, and a sensor-equipped copper block that serves as a surrogate for human skin [24,25]. To emulate these setups, CFD models typically define the lower and upper boundaries of the air gap as fabric and copper, respectively. However, the use of a copper skin surrogate introduces significant errors due to substantial differences in thermal properties—particularly density and thermal conductivity—between copper and human tissue [26]. Consequently, when copper is used in CFD simulations, the predicted burn injury times (e.g., time to first-degree burn) deviate significantly from those observed in actual human skin [27].
Another major limitation of existing CFD studies is the common assumption that the lateral boundaries of the air gap are sealed, a simplification adopted to replicate bench-scale test conditions. This assumption neglects flow and heat transfer interactions between the computational domain and adjacent air gaps [28]. As a result, burn injury predictions from these CFD simulations deviate from real-world conditions, where air circulates between interconnected air gaps around the human body [29].
Accurately assessing burn injury risks during fire exposure requires comprehensive consideration of the thermophysiological features of human tissues [30,31]. A study by Udayraj et al. [32] made a notable contribution in this area by coupling a CFD model with a bioheat model to evaluate skin temperature rise during flash fire exposure. In their approach, the copper block used in bench-scale tests was first analyzed through CFD simulations to determine the transient heat flux received during fire exposure. This time-dependent heat flux was then applied to a one-dimensional heat transfer model of the skin layer, based on the Pennes’ bioheat equation [33], yielding skin temperature distributions and estimated burn times. While this “one-way” coupling method represents a significant advancement in predicting skin burns, it possesses inherent limitations. Specifically, it assumes that heat transfer within the air gap remains unaffected by the substitution of copper for human tissue. Consequently, it fails to account for the distinct thermal properties of copper and skin.
Furthermore, the study by Udayraj et al. [32] models the human body as a single-layer skin, neglecting the subcutaneous fat, muscle, and other internal tissues. This simplification introduces two major drawbacks. First, it prevents the assessment of deeper tissue damage, as heat propagation beyond the skin layer is not considered. Second, the model applies the core body temperature directly to the inner surface of the skin, which is inconsistent with the actual thermophysiological features of the human body [34]. This unrealistic thermal boundary condition can lead to inaccurate predictions of skin temperature and, consequently, burn injury times.
1.3. Motivation
Existing studies are often limited by bench-scale simplifications, such as substituting human skin with copper blocks and treating air gaps as isolated domains, which overlook the interactions between interconnected air gaps and the thermophysiological features of human tissues. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces several key advancements: it models flow and heat transfer across interconnected air gaps; employs a two-way coupling approach that integrates human thermophysiology with air gap dynamics; and incorporates subcutaneous fat and muscle layers, in addition to the skin, to more accurately capture the thermal response of the human body. Using this framework, three-dimensional transient simulations are conducted under various air gap thicknesses, orientations, and wrinkle conditions. These simulations provide detailed insights into airflow patterns, heat transfer mechanisms within air gaps, and temperature distributions across multiple tissue layers, establishing a robust foundation for the design of more effective thermal protective clothing.
2. Fabric-air gap-human body model
To accurately represent the physiological structure and thermal response of the human body, this study extends the conventional fabric–air gap–skin model to a comprehensive fabric–air gap–human body model, as shown in Fig. 1. The enhanced model incorporates not only the skin layer but also the subcutaneous fat, muscle, and core layers. This division of human tissues is based on well-established anatomical principles [35], providing a realistic representation of the human body. Additionally, the tissue stratification aligns with standard physiological frameworks commonly used in biomedical engineering studies [36]. This consistency ensures the seamless integration of CFD simulations with existing bioheat models, effectively capturing the interactions between airflow, heat transfer, and thermal injury mechanisms.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the fabric–air gap–human body model.

During flash fire exposure, heat transfer within the fabric–air gap–human body system occurs through multiple mechanisms. As the fabric temperature rises, radiant heat propagates across the air gap to the skin surface. Additionally, buoyancy-driven airflow, induced by temperature gradients, may develop, influencing both temperature and velocity fields within the air gap while simultaneously facilitating heat and mass exchange between exposed and adjacent regions. As the skin absorbs heat, thermal energy accumulates, potentially leading to superficial burns. This absorbed heat then conducts through the skin layer into the subcutaneous fat and muscle, raising their temperatures and causing deeper thermal injuries, which may range from mild thermal stress to severe necrosis, depending on the intensity and duration of exposure.
The temperature distribution within human tissues during flash fire exposure is influenced not only by external heat transfer but also by intrinsic thermophysiological processes, which distinguish the human body from inanimate objects. These processes primarily include metabolic heat production and blood circulation [37,38]. Metabolic heat production occurs as cells generate heat through biochemical reactions, particularly during the conversion of nutrients into energy. This internal heat is continuously produced and distributed across tissue layers at varying rates, depending on the tissue type [39]. Blood circulation further affects temperature distribution by transporting heat throughout the body. Blood from the core circulates to peripheral tissues, facilitating heat exchange between tissue layers and the central blood pool [40]. This circulation influences how heat is absorbed, redistributed, and dissipated across different tissues. Consequently, the interaction between thermophysiological processes and external heat exposure must be considered.
3. Numerical simulation methodology
This study employs a simulation methodology based on a “two-way” coupling approach, which integrates realistic human tissue layers into the CFD model. In this framework, heat transfer in the air gap influences the temperature distribution within human tissues. Conversely, the temperature distribution within the body—affected by metabolic activity and blood perfusion—modifies the thermal conditions at the skin–air interface, thereby altering heat transfer dynamics within the air gap. This two-way feedback ensures that the interactions between the protective fabric, air gap, and human body are accurately captured.
The computational domain used in this study is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of a heated bottom boundary simulating the unexposed side of the fabric, with the top boundary representing the human body, including the skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle layers. The experimental conditions from Sawcyn and Torvi [41], involving fire exposure at 80 ± 2 kW/m2, are first simulated. Consequently, the dimensions of the computational domain align with those used in Ref. [41].

3.1. CFD model
The coupled flow and heat transfer phenomena within the air gap (i.e., the fluid domain) are modeled using the following three-dimensional, transient continuity, energy conservation, and momentum conservation equations for an incompressible flow:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
where U is the velocity vector; x, y, and z represent the three directions in the Cartesian coordinate system; u, v and w are the components of the velocity vector along these respective directions; the subscript a denotes air; ρ, cp, λ, and μ denote the density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and dynamic viscosity, respectively, which are functions of temperature as described by the empirical equations in Ref. [42]; T is the temperature; p is the pressure; and t is time.
For radiative heat transfer across the air gap, air is assumed to be a non-participating medium, meaning it neither absorbs nor scatters radiation. Under this assumption, the radiation intensity within the air gap is determined by solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) [43]. The RTE describes the propagation of radiation through the gap, enabling precise calculation of the radiative heat flux from the fabric to the skin surface.
For heat transfer within a specific human tissue layer (i.e., the solid domain), the following energy conservation equation is applied, extending the one-dimensional formulation from Ref. [39] to three dimensions:
(6)
where the subscript tissue denotes a specific tissue layer; λ, ρ, and cp represent the thermal properties of the tissue, as provided in Table 1; Qmet denotes the metabolic heat production; and Qblood refers to the heat exchange between the human core and the tissue layer due to blood circulation.

3.2. Bioheat model
The bioheat model is employed to quantify the internal heat sources within human tissues, specifically metabolic heat production (Qmet) and heat exchange due to blood flow (Qblood). These two factors are fundamental to the energy balance of tissue layers and are crucial for accurately modeling the human body's thermal response under extreme heat conditions.
Metabolic heat production within human tissues consists of two primary components: basal metabolic heat (Qbasal) and additional heat generated by physical activity (Qwork). The total metabolic heat per unit volume of tissue (Qmet) is expressed as follows:
(7)
In Equation (7), Qbasal represents the baseline heat production necessary to sustain essential physiological functions, such as cellular metabolism and respiration. The values of Qbasal vary across tissue types and are well-documented in Reference [39].
Qwork accounts for the additional heat generated by muscular exertion, as muscles are the primary tissues responsible for mechanical work. To quantify Qwork, the concept of the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is utilized, which expresses energy expenditure relative to the resting metabolic rate. Based on this definition, Qwork is given by:
(8)
where ΔMET denotes the increase in metabolic equivalent resulting from physical activity (set to 8 in the present simulations to represent a firefighter wearing full protective gear and engaged in moderate-intensity tasks, such as hose dragging or partial firefighting operations); A is the surface area of the relevant body region; and Vmuscle is the volume of muscle in that region.
Blood circulation facilitates heat exchange between the human core and peripheral tissues by transporting blood at core body temperature into various tissue layers. Thermal energy is subsequently transferred based on the temperature gradient between the blood and the surrounding tissues. This heat exchange is governed by:
(9)
where ε represents the heat exchange efficiency, assumed to be 1 in this study, indicating thermal equilibrium between the blood leaving the tissue and the local tissue temperature; BF is the volumetric blood flow rate through a given tissue layer; Tcore is the core body temperature, assumed to be 37 °C; Ttissue is the temperature of the tissue layer; and Vtissue is the volume of the tissue layer.
In the muscle layer, which experiences increased metabolic demands during physical activity, BF comprises both basal and activity-induced blood flow. Conversely, in non-muscular tissues, only the basal blood flow rate is considered. Therefore, the total blood flow rate for different tissue layers is computed as:
(10)
The equation above assumes that an additional blood flow of 1 L/h is required to support 1.16 W of external work, reflecting the increased perfusion necessary for oxygen delivery and metabolic waste removal during physical activity [39].
Notably, in Equation (9), Ttissue is obtained through coupled CFD–thermophysiology modeling. During flash fire exposure, Ttissue gradually increases over time, leading to a time-dependent variation in Qblood. When Ttissue is lower than Tcore, blood circulation supplies heat to the tissue. As exposure continues and Ttissue exceeds Tcore, blood circulation facilitates heat dissipation by transferring excess heat away from the tissue, helping to mitigate localized overheating.
By incorporating metabolic heat production and blood circulation-induced heat exchange, the bioheat model provides a robust framework for assessing tissue temperature dynamics. The integration of these thermophysiological processes ensures that this study accurately represents the human body's response to heat exposure, distinguishing it from previous investigations that focused on inanimate objects.
3.3. Initial and boundary conditions
Prior to flash fire exposure, the fabric–air gap–human body system is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium. The initial skin surface temperature is set to 36 °C, corresponding to a ΔMET value of 8. The air within the gap is assumed to be stagnant, reflecting quiescent pre-exposure conditions. This assumption is consistent with the initial conditions adopted in benchmark experiments (e.g., Sawcyn and Torvi [41]) and aligns with established practices in thermal protection modeling [24,25,32].
Upon flash fire exposure, the fabric surface temperature rises rapidly. To accurately capture this transient process, a time-dependent temperature boundary condition is applied to the fabric's inner surface. Experimental measurements by Sawcyn and Torvi [41] indicate that, under flash fire exposure, the fabric surface temperature follows a concentric square distribution (see Fig. 3). Based on these empirical findings, they divided the fabric surface into multiple regions and derived polynomial functions to describe the temporal evolution of temperature in each region under an incident heat flux of 80 ± 2 kW/m2. In this study, these functions are implemented using User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to define the fabric boundary condition.

The lateral boundaries of the air gap are defined as open, allowing airflow to enter and exit the computational domain. This configuration better reflects real-world conditions, where air gaps surrounding the human body are interconnected and subject to dynamic interactions. Accordingly, the use of open-boundary conditions enhances the physical realism of the model and improves its applicability to practical wear scenarios. For the human body, the inner boundary of the muscle layer is treated as isothermal and maintained at core body temperature.
3.4. Simulation settings
The three-dimensional transient numerical simulations were performed using ANSYS FLUENT. A pressure-based solver was selected due to its suitability for low-speed flow conditions. To accurately model radiative heat transfer across the air gap, the discrete ordinates (DO) method was employed to solve the RTE, given its robustness in handling complex geometries and high computational accuracy. The emissivity values for the fabric surface and human skin were set to 0.90 and 0.95, respectively [25]. Temperature-dependent air properties, time-dependent fabric surface temperatures, and internal heat sources within human tissues—including metabolic heat production (Qmet) and blood circulation-induced heat exchange (Qblood)—were implemented using UDFs. The momentum and energy governing equations were discretized using a second-order upwind scheme to enhance numerical accuracy and stability. The SIMPLE algorithm was employed for pressure-velocity coupling. Convergence criteria were set to 10−6 for the energy, radiation, and momentum equations, and 10−3 for the continuity equation. Given that flash fire exposure occurs over a short duration (typically 10–15 s), a transient time step of 0.01 s was adopted to ensure precise resolution of the rapid thermal and flow dynamics within the air gap.
3.5. Thermal injury prediction
The skin temperature distribution obtained from numerical simulations was further used to assess burn injury [45]. Skin burns are generally classified as first-degree or second-degree, with higher degrees indicating more severe tissue damage. The onset times for first- and second-degree burns are commonly evaluated using the Henriques burn integral, expressed as:
(11)
where ω represents a quantitative measure of skin burn; P is the pre-exponential factor; E denotes the activation energy of the skin; R is the universal gas constant; and T is the skin temperature in Kelvin.
Notably, both P and E are temperature-dependent, with their corresponding values listed in Table 2 for evaluating first- and second-degree skin burns. A first-degree burn is assumed to occur when ω reaches 0.5, and a second-degree burn when ω reaches 1.0. Although the Henriques burn integral can be extended to estimate third-degree burns, this requires the use of alternative parameter values for P and E. In the present study, simulated tissue temperature was instead employed as a direct indicator to assess the potential for thermal damage beyond the skin. For more accurate prediction of full-thickness injuries, advanced burn models that explicitly incorporate vascular dynamics and cellular viability may be required.

Skin temperature	P (1/s)	E/R (K)
317.15 K ≤ T < 323.15 K	2.185 × 10124	93,534.9
T ≥ 323.15 K	1.823 × 1051	39,109.8
4. Mesh generation and validation study
4.1. Mesh generation and numerical uncertainties
In this study, structured hexahedral meshes were generated using ANSYS Meshing due to their superior numerical stability and lower computational cost. A multi-zone sweeping method was employed to ensure high-quality meshing. Mesh refinement was applied to both the air gap and human tissue layers. Additionally, boundary layer meshes were incorporated near the fabric and skin surfaces to accurately capture sharp thermal gradients and complex flow dynamics.
A mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted using a representative case involving a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap under flash fire exposure. Five different mesh configurations (labeled A to E in increasing resolution) were tested, as detailed in Table 3. For each configuration, the skin surface temperature, total heat flux, and radiative heat flux were compared at 10 s of the exposure. Deviations from the finest mesh (scheme E) were then calculated to assess the accuracy of each configuration. As shown in Table 3, discrepancies between schemes D and E were minimal. Considering the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, scheme D was selected as the optimal mesh configuration for the 6.4 mm air gap scenario. A similar approach was applied to other cases, ensuring that the computational model accurately captured the thermal and flow characteristics within the fabric–air gap–human body system.
Table 3. Results for the mesh sensitivity analysis.

Meshing scheme	Element quantity	% Change in numerical predictions relative to scheme E
Skin temperature	Total heat flux	Radiative heat flux
A	195,160	1.65 %	1.64 %	0.99 %
B	468,000	0.94 %	0.93 %	0.42 %
C	1,048,000	0.59 %	0.61 %	0.46 %
D	2,479,464	0.04 %	0.04 %	0.17 %
E	4,343,920	0 %	0 %	0 %
In addition to the mesh independence analysis, further investigations were performed to assess the numerical uncertainties associated with time-step sensitivity and convergence robustness. To evaluate the effect of time-step size, the baseline value of 0.01 s was compared with alternative values of 0.005 s and 0.002 s under identical simulation conditions (a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap). The results indicated that variations in skin surface temperature, total heat flux, and radiative heat flux at 10 s of exposure remained within a 1 % margin across all tested time steps, suggesting that a time step of 0.01 s was sufficient to capture the thermal–fluid behavior accurately. Furthermore, the robustness of iterative convergence was evaluated by increasing the maximum number of iterations per time step from the default value of 30–50 and 100. The resulting variations in skin temperature and heat fluxes were also within 1 %, indicating that the numerical solution remained stable and reliable across different iteration thresholds. These findings, together with the time-step sensitivity analysis, confirm the overall temporal and convergence robustness of the simulation framework.
4.2. Validation
Direct experimental validation involving human subjects under flash fire conditions is neither ethically permissible nor practically feasible due to the risk of severe injury. Consequently, bench-scale tests utilizing sensor-equipped copper blocks—such as those reported by Sawcyn and Torvi [41]—are commonly adopted as a practical alternative for evaluating the thermal performance of protective clothing [24,25]. Although the present model incorporates realistic human tissue structures, validation against copper-based experiments remains a useful approach within the scope of this study. This is because the primary source of modeling uncertainty typically arises from simulating the complex flow and heat transfer phenomena within the air gap. Accurately reproducing the transient temperature and heat flux responses measured on the copper surface strengthens confidence in the model's capability to capture these key thermal–fluid mechanisms. Nonetheless, it is recognized that this validation strategy does not directly confirm the accuracy of tissue-level thermal responses. This limitation highlights the need for future experimental studies that more directly assess thermophysiological behavior under controlled and ethically acceptable conditions.
Within this context, the bench-scale experimental data reported by Sawcyn and Torvi [41] were used as a reference to validate the model's ability to predict heat transfer behavior within the air gap under controlled conditions. The simulations replicate the experimental conditions, where the air gap is set in a horizontal orientation with thicknesses of 6.4 mm and 19.1 mm, and the protective fabric is assumed to be flat and wrinkle-free. The transient temperature rise of the copper block during flash fire exposure is simulated over a 10 s duration and compared against the experimental measurements reported by Sawcyn and Torvi [41]. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the simulated temperature profile closely follows the experimental results, with a maximum deviation of 8 %. This high level of agreement indicates that the numerical model effectively captures the dominant heat transfer mechanisms within the air gap.

Further validation is performed through a comparative analysis with existing numerical studies that model the same experimental setup. Fig. 5 presents the predicted heat flux at the copper block, demonstrating that the present simulation closely aligns with previous numerical findings, with a deviation of approximately 5 %. This consistency further reinforces the credibility of the developed model and enhances confidence in its capability to extend beyond bench-scale conditions and accurately simulate the thermal response of human tissues under flash fire exposure.

5. Results and discussion
5.1. Effects of human thermophysiology
To highlight the significance of incorporating thermophysiological features into thermal protection modeling, a series of numerical simulations were performed using the same air gap configurations as those reported by Udayraj et al. [32], while employing the coupled CFD–thermophysiology approach described in Section 3. Fig. 6 compares the predicted skin burn injury times from the present study with those from Udayraj et al. [32] under flash fire exposure of 80 ± 2 kW/m2, with horizontal air gap thicknesses of 6.4 mm, 9.5 mm, and 12.5 mm. Both studies exhibit a consistent trend: burn injury times increase with air gap thickness, and second-degree burns consistently occur approximately 0.25 s after the onset of first-degree burns. Despite this agreement, a notable discrepancy is observed—burn onset times predicted by the present model are consistently earlier than those reported by Udayraj et al. [32]. For instance, for a 6.4 mm air gap, first-degree burns are predicted to occur approximately 0.7 s earlier in the present model, representing a reduction of nearly 15 %.

Fig. 6. Comparison of predicted skin burn injury times between the present study and available literature data.

The primary reason for the earlier burn onset is the explicit inclusion of thermophysiological processes in the present model—particularly metabolic heat production—which raises baseline skin temperature, thereby accelerating burn injuries. Another contributing factor is the modeling of the skin surrogate: Udayraj et al. [32] used a copper block instead of human skin in their simulation, significantly altering the heat transfer characteristics. Copper's high thermal conductivity allows it to dissipate absorbed heat rapidly, resulting in a more uniform temperature distribution and lower surface temperature under identical heat flux conditions. In contrast, human skin has relatively low thermal conductivity, causing heat to accumulate at the surface, leading to a more rapid temperature rise and an earlier onset of burns. These differences collectively explain why the present model predicts earlier burns, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating realistic human thermophysiological features for accurate burn injury predictions.
To further isolate and quantify the impact of thermophysiological processes on burn predictions, an additional simulation was conducted under identical exposure conditions, involving a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap. In this case, both metabolic heat production and blood circulation-induced heat exchange were deactivated, thereby simulating a purely passive thermal response. Under this configuration, the predicted time to first-degree burn increased to 4.31 s, compared to 3.99 s when thermophysiological processes were included. This difference highlights the contribution of internal heat sources and reinforces the necessity of incorporating these mechanisms into thermal protection modeling.
While the preceding comparison examined the presence or absence of internal heat sources, a subsequent sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how variations in metabolic rate influence skin burn predictions. Notably, metabolic activity and blood perfusion are inherently interdependent processes, as elevated metabolic demand elicits increased blood flow to sustain physiological function. Accordingly, to preserve physiological realism, the sensitivity analysis varied the metabolic rate, which in turn modulates perfusion dynamics and thus governs both internal heat sources.
Simulations were conducted for ΔMET values of 1, 3, 5, and 8, representing conditions ranging from rest to moderate physical exertion. As shown in Fig. 7, an increase in metabolic rate accelerates skin burn onset, reducing the time required to reach both first- and second-degree burn thresholds. For instance, under the ΔMET = 5 condition, the time to first-degree burn was approximately 0.2 s shorter than that for ΔMET = 1. Across the examined range, each 2-unit increase in ΔMET resulted in a 0.1 s decrease in the time to first-degree burn. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic physical activity levels into thermal protection modeling to improve predictive accuracy.

Beyond the skin layer, this study incorporates additional tissue layers, including subcutaneous fat and muscle, to enable an assessment of deeper tissue damage during prolonged exposure. Fig. 8 illustrates the temporal evolution of temperature within these deeper tissues over a 30 s flash fire exposure, assuming a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap. Following the onset of exposure, deeper tissues exhibit a delayed thermal response. After 5 s, the superficial fat temperature increases by only 0.4 °C. A more pronounced temperature rise in the subcutaneous fat becomes evident after 6 s, indicating that heat conduction through the skin has begun to significantly affect underlying tissue. By 30 s, the superficial fat temperature reaches 86 °C. Given that protein denaturation and coagulation typically occur at 70 °C, this result indicates a high likelihood of irreversible thermal damage within the superficial fat. Clinically, such damage may manifest as tissue necrosis and a loss of physiological function.

Fig. 8. Deeper tissue temperature rises during prolonged exposure.

However, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the temperature rise within the muscle layer remains minimal during the 30 s exposure for the body region examined in this study (i.e., the human chest). This attenuated thermal response is primarily attributed to the relatively thick subcutaneous fat layer (15 mm; see Table 1), which provides substantial thermal insulation. To further assess the necessity of including the muscle layer in the modeling framework, additional simulations were performed for the forearm, a representative anatomical region with a relatively thin fat layer. In this case, a more pronounced increase in muscle temperature was observed over the same exposure duration, suggesting that assuming a constant deep-tissue (muscle) temperature may introduce non-negligible prediction errors.

The distribution of air gap thickness beneath the clothing surface is influenced by several factors, such as the garment's fit and the mechanical properties of the fabric. Song [8] employed three-dimensional scanning technology to quantify the air gap thickness between protective clothing and the wearer's body. The results revealed that the air gap ranged from 2 mm to 24 mm, with most measurements falling within the 13 mm range. In this section, horizontal air gap thicknesses of 6.4 mm, 7.5 mm, 8.5 mm, 9.5 mm, 10.5 mm, 11.5 mm, and 12.5 mm were selected for investigation.
As shown in Fig. 6, increasing air gap thickness delays the onset of skin burns, suggesting that thicker air gaps offer enhanced thermal protection. Therefore, measures aimed at increasing air gap thickness, such as designing looser-fitting clothing, can improve thermal protective performance during extreme heat exposure. The onset of skin burns is primarily governed by the rise in skin temperature. Fig. 9(a) presents the temporal temperature profiles at the skin surface for various air gap thicknesses. The results indicate that thicker air gaps slow the rise in skin temperature. For instance, with a 6.4 mm air gap, the skin temperature reaches 95 °C after 10 s of flash fire exposure, while with a 12.5 mm air gap, the temperature only rises to 82 °C.

The observed difference can be attributed to the reduction in total and radiative heat fluxes reaching the skin surface as air gap thickness increases, as shown in Fig. 9(b) and (c). Another key observation from these figures is that both heat fluxes stabilize over time following the initial exposure due to the rapid thermal equilibrium of the fabric. However, despite this stabilization, skin temperature continues to rise, as demonstrated in Fig. 9(a). This phenomenon highlights a critical point: the human body's thermal response is slower due to the relatively low rate of internal heat transfer. As a result, heat continues to accumulate at the skin surface, leading to sustained damage even after the total heat flux has stabilized.
Further analysis of the heat flux data presented in Fig. 9(b) and (c) indicates that heat transfer across the air gap is predominantly governed by radiation. For instance, at 10 s of exposure in the 6.4 mm air gap scenario, the total heat flux is 25,782 W/m2, with radiative heat flux contributing 21,952 W/m2, accounting for approximately 85 % of the total. Although the contributions from conduction and convection are smaller, their variation with air gap thickness follows a more complex pattern. Fig. 9(d) illustrates the conductive/convective heat flux reaching the skin surface at 10 s for different air gap thicknesses. The results reveal a non-linear relationship. This can be attributed to the transition from conduction to natural convection as air gap thickness increases. At smaller thicknesses, heat transfer is primarily conductive due to limited buoyancy-driven airflow, and increasing air gap thickness enhances conductive insulation, thereby reducing the associated heat flux. However, at larger thicknesses, natural convection becomes dominant, leading to enhanced convective heat transfer.
Additional support for the above discussion is provided by the temperature fields within the air gap, as shown in Fig. 10. In the 6.4 mm scenario, a smooth and continuous temperature gradient is observed from the warmer to the cooler regions. However, in the 12.5 mm air gap, the presence of buoyancy-driven airflow causes a deviation from this pattern, resulting in a more complex temperature field distribution.

The Grashof number (Gr), a dimensionless quantity used to characterize the relative significance of conduction and natural convection, was calculated for the conditions corresponding to Fig. 9(d). For the 8.5 mm case, Gr equals 2923, which falls within the critical range (2500–3000) identified in classical heat transfer theory for the transition from conduction to convection. This suggests that traditional empirical convection heat transfer theory remains applicable under flash fire exposure conditions.
5.3. Effects of air gap orientation
Air gap orientation between thermal protective clothing and the wearer's body is a critical factor influencing heat transfer dynamics and, consequently, thermal protective performance. This section investigates the effects of air gap orientation by comparing horizontal and vertical configurations under identical exposure conditions.
A comparative analysis of skin burn injury times under different air gap orientations is presented in Fig. 11. The results demonstrate that, for a given air gap thickness, the vertical orientation provides superior thermal protection, as evidenced by the delayed onset of skin burns. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms, Fig. 12 illustrates the temporal evolution of key thermal parameters—including skin surface temperature, total heat flux, radiative heat flux, and conductive/convective heat flux—for representative air gap thicknesses of 6.4 mm, 8.5 mm, and 12.5 mm in both orientations. The findings reveal that, following flash fire exposure, the rate of skin temperature rise is slower in the vertical orientation, accompanied by a lower total heat flux at the skin surface. As shown in Fig. 12(d), these observed differences in total heat flux are primarily attributed to variations in conductive/convective heat transfer, which is substantially lower in the vertical configuration.

Fig. 12. Simulation results for horizontal and vertical air gap cases.

As illustrated in Fig. 13, in the horizontal orientation—particularly when the air gap thickness exceeds 8.5 mm—localized convection cells form due to temperature-induced density gradients. These cells emerge as heated air near the fabric's inner surface rises, circulates, and eventually reaches the skin, creating a recirculating flow. The process traps hot air within the exposure region, continuously transporting heat from the fabric to the skin. In contrast, in the vertical orientation, although buoyancy-driven airflow remains present, it facilitates the upward displacement of heated air, diverting it away from the exposure site into adjacent regions. This natural ventilation mechanism effectively reduces convective heat transfer to the skin. Additionally, as heated air rises, cooler air is drawn into the air gap from interconnected gaps, lowering the average air temperature and providing an additional cooling effect. These findings explain the reduction in convective heat flux in the vertical air gap configuration. They also highlight a critical limitation of conventional simulations, which impose sealed lateral boundaries on the air gap, neglecting thermal interactions between adjacent regions. Such simplifications fail to capture the actual airflow dynamics governing convective heat transfer.

The influence of air gap orientation on conductive/convective heat transfer becomes more pronounced as air gap thickness increases, as evidenced by the widening difference in burn times between horizontal and vertical configurations with increasing air gap thickness (see Fig. 11).
Furthermore, Fig. 11 demonstrates that, similar to horizontal air gaps, increasing air gap thickness in the vertical orientation delays skin burn onset. However, unlike horizontal air gaps, in the vertical configuration, increasing air gap thickness leads to a continuous reduction in conductive/convective heat flux, even at larger thicknesses. This occurs because, in thinner vertical air gaps, increasing thickness primarily reduces conductive heat transfer, whereas in thicker gaps, it enhances buoyancy-driven airflow. This enhanced airflow facilitates greater heat removal from the exposure region, further reducing convective heat transfer to the skin.
5.4. Effects of heterogeneity
In contrast to the uniform air gap scenarios examined in previous sections, real protective clothing rarely maintains perfectly even air gaps. Fabric wrinkles and folds introduce spatial heterogeneity, altering heat transfer characteristics and affecting thermal protective performance.
To quantitatively assess these effects, this section employs the concept of the wrinkle aspect ratio (L/H, illustrated in Fig. 2) to characterize the severity of fabric wrinkling under realistic wear conditions. In this analysis, the wrinkle amplitude (H) is fixed at 5 mm, and three aspect ratio cases (L/H = 2, 3, ∞) are compared. A decrease in the aspect ratio from ∞ to 3 or 2 represents increasingly pronounced wrinkling, characterized by a higher frequency of folds per unit fabric area, whereas an aspect ratio of ∞ corresponds to a flat fabric with a uniform air gap (i.e., no wrinkles). To ensure consistency, the average distance between the wrinkled fabric and the skin surface is defined as the air gap thickness for wrinkled cases. Additionally, to isolate the geometric effect of wrinkling on heat transfer, the temperature distribution at the inner fabric surface is assumed to remain the same as in the flat fabric case. This approach enables a direct evaluation of how wrinkles alone influence heat transfer dynamics.
Fig. 14 compares skin burn injury times for horizontal and vertical air gaps with thicknesses of 6.4 mm and 12.5 mm under varying wrinkle aspect ratios. The results clearly demonstrate that, for a given air gap thickness, the introduction of geometric heterogeneity significantly accelerates burn onset in both orientations. Furthermore, the extent of protective performance degradation correlates with wrinkle severity: lower aspect ratios (i.e., more pronounced wrinkles) lead to even shorter burn times compared to mildly wrinkled conditions. These findings highlight that any deviation from a uniform air gap—whether caused by fabric wrinkling, garment fit issues, or wearer movement—can substantially compromise the thermal protective performance of clothing systems.

Fig. 14. Predicted skin burn injury times for representative cases.

To better understand this phenomenon, Fig. 15 examines the transient total, radiative, and conductive/convective heat fluxes reaching the skin for a representative case (6.4 mm air gap thickness) under horizontal and vertical orientations, comparing wrinkled and flat fabric conditions. As shown in Fig. 15(a), the total heat flux to the skin is higher when the fabric is wrinkled than in the flat fabric case for both orientations. Further decomposition of the heat transfer modes (Fig. 15(b) and (c)) reveals that fabric wrinkles enhance both radiative and conductive/convective heat transfer. However, the increase in radiative heat flux is the dominant factor driving the higher total heat flux. For instance, in a horizontal 6.4 mm air gap under flash fire exposure, the case with an aspect ratio of 2 delivers a total heat flux to the skin that is 3004 W/m2 higher than that of a uniform air gap at 10 s into the exposure. Of this increase, 2284 W/m2 is due to an elevated radiative heat flux, meaning 76 % of the additional heat transfer is attributed to enhanced radiation. While the conductive/convective heat flux also increases with wrinkling, its contribution is less significant than that of radiation.

Fig. 15. Simulated total, radiative, and conductive/convective heat fluxes for representative cases.

The physical mechanisms underlying the enhanced heat transfer due to fabric wrinkling can be explained by the geometric and flow alterations induced by the wrinkles. Wrinkles modify the fabric geometry, creating alternating regions where the air gap is thinner (at fabric folds near the skin) and thicker (above the troughs of wrinkles). In thinner gap sections, the hot inner fabric surface is positioned closer to the skin, enhancing radiative heat transfer due to the reduced separation distance and an increased view-factor between the fabric and skin. Conversely, in thicker gap sections, air pockets form that can sustain localized convection.
Fig. 16 illustrates the airflow velocity fields within 6.4 mm horizontal air gaps with different levels of fabric wrinkling. Although overall air velocities within the gap remain low—expected given the small length scale—the presence of wrinkles significantly alters the airflow pattern. Buoyancy-driven convection cells emerge in regions where the air gap is locally enlarged. These convection cells form because the increased local air gap thickness allows warmer air, heated by the fabric, to rise while cooler air descends, establishing a recirculating flow. The formation of these local convection cells enhances convective heat transfer in the thicker gap regions. In a horizontal orientation, this phenomenon leads to an increased convective heat flux to the skin, contributing to the rise in total heat flux observed in Fig. 15(a).

In summary, the heterogeneous air gap formed by fabric wrinkles intensifies radiative heating in thinner regions and enhances localized convective heat transfer in wider regions. This combined effect increases overall heat transfer across the horizontal air gap, reducing thermal protective performance.
It is important to note that, despite the negative impacts of fabric wrinkles, the general trends identified in Sections 5.2 Effects of air gap thickness, 5.3 Effects of air gap orientation regarding air gap thickness and orientation remain valid even in the presence of spatial heterogeneity. Fig. 17 illustrates that increasing the overall air gap thickness continues to enhance thermal protection even when the fabric is wrinkled. Similarly, a vertical air gap orientation still provides superior protection compared to a horizontal gap of the same thickness, despite the presence of fabric wrinkles. These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of a thicker air gap and the advantages of a vertical orientation are inherent characteristics of the heat transfer mechanisms. Although fabric wrinkles diminish these benefits to some extent, the fundamental trends persist under realistic, non-uniform air gap conditions.

As demonstrated by the results, maintaining an adequate air gap beneath the garment is critical for reducing heat transfer to the skin. To achieve this, protective clothing should incorporate features such as loose-fitting designs, spacer fabrics, or integrated padding layers that help preserve the air gap during wear. In addition, garment structures that promote vertically oriented airflow—such as vertically aligned quilting patterns or strategically placed, air-permeable inserts—can enhance natural convection. This passive heat dissipation mechanism further mitigates the risk of thermal injury. Furthermore, fabric wrinkling introduces significant spatial heterogeneity within the air gap, leading to localized increases in heat flux and accelerating burn onset. To counteract this effect, garments should utilize fabrics with higher bending stiffness or adopt multi-layer composite constructions to suppress wrinkling.
Despite the valuable design insights offered, several modeling limitations should be acknowledged. First, the present model assumes static air gaps, which may not accurately reflect real-world conditions where body movements continuously alter garment fit and air gap geometry. In practice, maintaining a perfectly isolated air gap orientation is also unlikely. For vertical gaps in particular, dynamic deformations can disrupt the buoyancy-driven convective flows that contribute to enhanced thermal protection in such configurations. Previous studies—for example, the work by Udayraj et al. [25]—have simulated the effects of human motion, specifically the periodic variation in air gap thickness, on heat transfer through vertical gaps and reported a decline in protective performance. However, these studies did not consider the thermal responses of human tissues. Future research could extend the present model to incorporate dynamic air gap variations induced by body movement.
Another limitation lies in the use of a fixed, time-dependent temperature boundary condition applied to the inner surface of the fabric. While this approach provides a controlled and experimentally validated input for simulating heat transfer, it does not allow thermal feedback from the human body to influence the fabric temperature. Given that the current modeling framework incorporates two-way coupling between the human body and the air gap, it could be further extended by explicit modeling of the fire source. This enhancement would enable the development of a fully coupled model integrating the fire source, fabric, air gap, and multi-layered human tissues, thereby capturing dynamic thermal interactions more realistically.
A further limitation of the present model is the omission of moisture transport and sweat evaporation mechanisms. Under realistic conditions, evaporative cooling due to sweating can substantially influence skin surface temperatures and local heat fluxes, thereby affecting both the onset and severity of burn injuries. These effects become particularly pronounced under high-heat-flux or prolonged exposure scenarios, where sweat production is elevated and latent heat exchange becomes significant. The absence of such mechanisms may lead to inaccuracies in predicting skin burn risk. To enhance model fidelity and predictive reliability, future work should incorporate coupled heat and moisture transport processes.
6. Conclusions
This study developed a novel simulation framework that fully integrates computational fluid dynamics with human thermophysiology to evaluate the thermal–fluid behavior of air gaps beneath thermal protective clothing. Simulation results demonstrated that incorporating thermophysiological features significantly influences burn predictions by accelerating the onset of injury. Compared to models that neglect these features, the present simulations predicted approximately 15 % shorter burn times.
Air gap thickness was identified as a critical parameter in thermal protection, with thicker air gaps delaying the onset of skin burns. For instance, increasing the horizontal air gap from 6.4 mm to 12.5 mm reduced skin temperature by more than 10 °C after 10 s of exposure. Air gap orientation also played a pivotal role in heat transfer dynamics. Vertical gaps consistently provided superior thermal protection compared to horizontal gaps of equivalent thickness, as buoyancy-driven airflow displaced heated air upward, thereby reducing convective heat transfer to the skin. These findings highlight the benefits of clothing designs that facilitate naturally ventilated heat dissipation.
Fabric wrinkles and folds were found to significantly compromise thermal protection by introducing uneven air gaps. Simulations showed that wrinkled fabrics increased heat flux to the skin—primarily due to enhanced radiative transfer—resulting in substantially earlier burn onset compared to configurations with smooth, uniform gaps. These results suggest that minimizing fabric wrinkling, through appropriate material selection or garment structuring, can improve thermal protection and enhance safety for individuals exposed to extreme thermal environments.

An additional case study was conducted for an anatomical region characterized by a thinner subcutaneous fat layer—namely, the human forearm. The simulation was carried out under the same exposure conditions as in the main study, and involved a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap, a flat fabric surface, and a 30 s exposure duration. The thermal properties of the forearm tissues were assumed to be consistent with those provided in Table 1, while the layer thicknesses were adjusted to 2.0 mm for the skin, 1.7 mm for subcutaneous fat, and 15.3 mm for muscle, based on anatomical data reported in Ref. [44].

Fig. A.1. Temporal evolution of muscle temperature during a 30 s exposure for the chest and forearm regions

The results of this supplementary simulation are compared with the baseline chest case in Figure A.1. The plotted curves depict the temporal evolution of temperature in the muscle layer for both anatomical regions. In the chest region, the temperature rise remains negligible throughout the exposure. In contrast, the forearm muscle exhibits a pronounced temperature increase of approximately 8 °C. This intensified thermal response is primarily attributed to the substantially thinner subcutaneous fat layer in the forearm (1.7 mm vs. 15 mm), which provides less thermal insulation against external heat flux. These findings indicate that assuming a constant deep-tissue (muscle) temperature may lead to non-negligible prediction errors. Therefore, inclusion of the muscle layer is necessary, particularly when modeling anatomical regions with limited subcutaneous insulation.
Appendix B.
To further highlight the added value of three-dimensional modeling—even in the absence of geometric heterogeneity—a comparative simulation was conducted between a simplified two-dimensional (2D) model and the full three-dimensional (3D) model under identical exposure conditions. In the 2D configuration, the computational domain shown in Fig. 2 was reduced by eliminating the depth dimension along the x-axis. The boundary condition imposed on the inner fabric surface was obtained from the temperature distribution along the central longitudinal axis (y-axis) of the 3D simulation (see Fig. 3). All other parameters—including a 6.4 mm horizontal air gap and a flat fabric surface—were kept constant to ensure direct comparability.

Parameter	2D model	3D model	Difference
Skin temperature (oC)	106.4	104.0	2.4
Conductive/convective heat flux (W/m2)	3928.3	3740.7	187.6
Radiative heat flux (W/m2)	26618.1	24819.5	1798.6
Total heat flux (W/m2)	30546.4	28560.2	1986.2
To enable direct comparison, post-processing of the 3D simulation results was performed to extract data at the spatial location corresponding to the 2D domain. As summarized in Table B.1, the 2D simulation produced a higher skin temperature and greater heat fluxes. These discrepancies arise from inherent limitations of the 2D approximation. Specifically, by extending the 2D domain uniformly along the depth direction, the localized fabric temperature distribution in the 3D model—characterized by concentric thermal gradients—is effectively converted into continuous high-temperature bands. This artificial homogenization leads to an overestimation of the fabric's effective temperature, thereby significantly inflating radiative flux predictions in the 2D model. These findings highlight the necessity of 3D analysis, even under uniform air gap configurations.
