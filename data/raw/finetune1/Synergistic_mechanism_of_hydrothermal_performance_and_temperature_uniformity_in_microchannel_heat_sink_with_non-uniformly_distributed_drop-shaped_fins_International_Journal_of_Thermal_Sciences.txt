1. Introduction
The trend towards integrated, high-heat-flux, and miniaturized electronic devices inevitably leads to increasingly higher heat flux density per unit area. In the 1980s, the heat flux density of integrated circuits was approximately 10 W/cm2, which increased to 20–30 W/cm2 in the 1990s [1]. If this heat cannot be dissipated rapidly, electronic components will suffer negative impacts including reduced lifespan, reduced operational stability, and performance degradation when operating temperatures exceed rated limits. Research indicated that for electronic components operating within the 70–80 °C range, each 1 °C temperature rise reduced reliability by 5 % [2]. Therefore, how to rapidly and efficiently dissipate heat generated by electronic components has become a pressing challenge demanding immediate solutions.
In 1981, Tuckerman and Pease [3] designed a high-performance integrated circuit heat sink, introducing the concept of microchannel heat exchangers to address large-scale “thermal barriers” in integrated circuits. Microchannel heat exchangers outperform traditional-sized heat exchangers in both volumetric heat transfer capacity and heat transfer speed. They also offer significant advantages in operational stability, manufacturing costs, and service life, making them one of the optimal solutions for heat exchange. These systems are widely applicable in the microelectronics field.
The compact dimensions and large surface-to-volume ratio of microchannels generate substantial internal fluid flow resistance, severely constraining thermal dissipation performance. This limitation has prompted extensive scholarly focus on structural optimization of microchannel heat exchangers, with two predominant design strategies emerging: flow path modification through configurations like serpentine [[4], [5], [6]], double-layer [[7], [8], [9]], biomimetic fractal [10,11], and wavy channels [12,13] to enhance fluid turbulence and expand heat transfer area; and integration of enhancement structures such as cavities [14,15], porous media [[16], [17], [18]] and micro-fins [[19], [20], [21]] to disrupt thermal/hydrodynamic boundary layer development, promote hot-cold fluid mixing, and facilitate rapid heat dispersion during thermal transfer processes for improved conduction efficiency.
Microchannels with fin structures improve thermal performance through simultaneous disruption of thermal/hydrodynamic boundary layers and reduction of thermal boundary layer thickness [22]. Well-configured fin structures enhance temperature and flow uniformity in liquid-cooled cold plates. Hekmatara [23] has demonstrated elevated fluid velocity within fin arrays surpasses diminished open-area flow velocity in augmenting microchannel cooling performance, offsetting reductions in aggregate fin area and open-flow region deficiencies. Derakhshanpour et al. [24] incorporated semicircular fins along channel sidewalls, where the curved fins mitigated stagnation zone effects and directed fluid toward channel walls, thereby reducing bottom surface temperature. Chen et al. [25] proposed a microchannel heat exchanger with twisted vane fins generating secondary flow to enhance thermal exchange between mainstream and near-wall flows. Their results demonstrated that the twisted vane configuration reduced flow separation zones behind fins, improved pressure loss characteristics, positively influenced wall temperature uniformity, and enhanced heat transfer performance. These enhancements effectively accelerated heat dispersion and transfer within microchannels, enabling more efficient thermal conduction. Li et al. [26] installed rectangular fins on channel bottom walls, observing that solid fins induced vortex formation and recirculation flows which promoted thermal boundary layer regeneration after disruption, positively impacting heat transfer intensification.
The arrangement of fins influences heat dissipation performance by modulating key factors such as convective and wetting surface area, fluid flow volume within the heat sink, flow field distribution, and fluid mixing efficiency. This arrangement is primarily determined by the lateral and longitudinal spacing between fins. To quantify fin density, porosity—the ratio of fluid-accessible volume to the total radiator volume—is commonly employed. Zhao et al. [27] conducted numerical simulations to investigate porosity variations ranging from 0.56 to 0.89 and found that its impact on heat transfer significantly outweighs its effect on pressure drop. Their results indicate that thermal-hydraulic performance initially improves with increasing porosity but begins to deteriorate beyond a threshold of 0.75. This decline suggests that excessively low fin density leads to the formation of large vortices around the fins, causing localized temperature increases and impaired heat transfer. In a follow-up study, Zhao et al. [28] proposed a cooling plate design incorporating non-uniformly distributed fins to enhance temperature uniformity. Among various configurations, increasing fin height along the Y-axis demonstrated the most pronounced improvement, achieving a 29.84 % reduction in pump power consumption and a 17.43 % decrease in peak temperature. Chiu et al. [29] performed a numerical analysis on the thermal and fluid dynamic behavior of coolant in a micro-needle fin heat exchanger with variable fin density. Their findings revealed that, for heat exchangers with comparable fin counts, variable density arrangements achieved superior heat source temperature uniformity compared to staggered layouts, with an optimal effective thermal resistance of 0.258 K/W. Furthermore, Kewalramani et al. [30] examined the thermohydraulic performance of elliptical-fin microchannel heat exchangers using deionized water as the coolant. They observed that the size of the recirculation zone downstream of the fin trailing edge directly affects the local heat transfer coefficient: under identical mass flow rates, higher fin density combined with sparser overall configurations resulted in larger recirculation zones.
Izci et al. [31] demonstrated superior heat transfer capability in drop-shaped fins. Kosar and Peles [32] conducted experimental parametric analysis on microchannel heat exchangers with rectangular, circular, conical, and teardrop fin configurations, revealing that teardrop fins with tapered tips outperformed streamlined fins in heat transfer enhancement. This thermal performance improvement is attributed to elongated wake regions and mitigation of flow separation by the pointed fin tips [31], combined with streamlined profiles that optimize flow distribution while reducing pressure losses. As the fluid flows through the channel, the rate of heat transfer gradually decreases along the flow direction due to the heating of the fluid itself. Keshavarz et al. [33] found that the fluid outlet temperature increased by 0.6 %, and the pumping power fell by 13.3 % for the drop-shaped pin fin. The extended wake zone generated by the pointed tail design intensifies thermal disturbance, and together with the streamlined body, effectively suppresses flow separation, thereby achieving a synergistic optimization of enhanced heat transfer performance and reduced flow resistance. This structural feature demonstrates significant potential for application in microchannel heat exchangers.
To enhance heat transfer downstream of the channel, Zhu et al. [34] proposed a microchannel heat exchanger featuring a bow-shaped cavity with a gradient ranging from-sparse-to-dense. Compared to a similar design with the opposite gradient from-dense-to-sparse, the results indicated that the sparse-to-dense configuration yielded a smaller overheated region, as well as the lowest heat transfer entropy generation and total entropy generation. Different researchers [35,36] have investigated the arrangement of fins within the flow area and found that a non-uniform distribution of fins results in varying heat transfer coefficients and friction factors across different sections. This non-uniform fin distribution can lead to a higher Nu, thereby enhancing the overall heat transfer performance. The non-uniform fin arrangement, designed with a gradient pattern that is sparser at the front and denser towards the rear, effectively mitigates downstream overheating. Simultaneously, this arrangement optimizes local fin density to enhance the overall Nu, thereby achieving a synergistic improvement in heat transfer enhancement and energy consumption reduction.
Although previous studies have individually validated the flow and heat transfer enhancement characteristics of drop-shaped fins and the performance benefits of non-uniform arrangements, the synergistic mechanism between these two strategies has not been systematically investigated. Particularly in high-power microelectronic cooling applications, achieving integrated optimization of thermal boundary layer reconstruction and low-entropy generation flow through coordinated structural and arrangement design remains a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. At microscales, high thermal conductivity of copper significantly reduces thermal resistance, particularly enhancing heat transfer efficiency in localized hot spots [37]. Concurrently, copper enables precision fabrication at 10–100 μm scales through processes including photolithography, micromilling, electrochemical machining, and 3D printing [38], while exhibiting good corrosion resistance [39].
Therefore, to enhance the temperature uniformity of microchannels and achieve more effective cooling for compact electronic devices, this paper presents an innovative design of copper microchannel heat exchangers featuring drop-shaped fins with arrangement from-sparse-to-dense (MCHX-FSTD), and it was compared with the microchannel heat exchanger with uniform fin structures (MCHX-UNIFORM). Meanwhile, in order to address the drawback of the heat exchange enhancement structure within the channel for the resistance loss along the path of the microchannel heat exchanger, this study selected the drop-shaped streamlined structure as the basic geometric shape of the fins. The study numerically simulated the flow and heat transfer behavior of liquids under different Re with different fin arrangements, and systematically analyzed the influence of fin distribution on the local hydrothermal performance and temperature uniformity of microchannels. At the same time, the geometric dimensions of the fins are studied, and the collaborative mechanism of the geometric configuration and arrangement of the fins is further investigated.
2. Geometry of the new design
The geometry of microchannel heat sinks consists of parallel liquid channels and copper substrate solid, as depicted in Fig. 1. This study proposes a novel microchannel heat sink design incorporating drop-shaped fins arranged in a microchannel heat exchanger featuring drop-shaped fins with arrangement from-sparse-to-dense (MCHX-FSTD). For comparative analysis, microchannel heat exchanger with uniform fin structures (MCHX-UNIFORM) and smooth corresponding microchannels (MCHX-SC) were also investigated. In MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM, only the arrangement of the fins is changed, and the number of fins remains the same. To reduce the computational cost, only a single unit computational domain is employed for numerical simulations due to the symmetry of microchannel heat sinks. The overall dimension of the computational domain is L × W × Hs = 10 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.35 mm. These geometric features are consistent with Zhu et al. [34].In the middle location of the unit computational domain, there is a fluid region, which is presented as a fluid channel. The channel width and height are 0.1 mm (Wch) and 0.2 mm (Hch) respectively. Considering the inlet effect, the first two aligned grooves are 0.5 mm far away from channel inlet. For the MCHX-FSTD design, the distance (Ln) between two adjacent fins decreases gradually by 0.02 (Li) mm along the direction of fluid flow, specifically expressed as, Ln=Ln+1-Li, starting with an initial interval of 0.54 mm between the first pair of fins. Meanwhile, the fin spacing of MCHX-UNIFORM is always 0.4 mm. As a benchmark case for the research, the basic geometric features of the fin are basically consistent with the work of Khan et al. [40], among which the specific cross-sectional dimensions of the fin with a height of 0.2 mm (Hfin) are shown in Fig. 1.

3. Numerical method
3.1. Mathematic equations
Copper was selected as the material for the solid boundaries in this study, with its physical properties held constant, the density (ρc) of copper is 8978 kg/m3, its specific heat capacity (Cp,c) is 0.381 kJ/(kg∙K), and its thermal conductivity (λc) is 387.6 W/(m·K).Water is chosen as the working fluid. The fluid flow in channels is assumed to be laminar, steady, continuous and incompressible [41,42]. The governing equations of the numerical model can be simplified as follows.

(7)
(8)
The above governing equations are solved with finite volume method. The commercial software of FLUENT was used for the numerical simulation, in which the implicit method was adopted for the governing equations discretization. Convection terms in the momentum and energy conservation equations were discretized using a second-order upwind scheme. Computations terminated and were considered converged when residuals of Equations (1), (2), (3), (4) fell below 10−6.
3.2. Boundary conditions
To solve above governing equations, the following boundary conditions were employed in present numerical simulations.
(1)
At the microchannel inlet, an average and constant velocity is assumed:
(9)
Where Tin is temperature of deionized water at channel inlet, Tin = 300 K; u, v and w are velocity component of deionized water flowing along x, y and z direction, respectively. The fluid flow velocity (uin) at channel inlet are defined as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 m/s, respectively.

Where qh is the constant heat flux generated from integrated circuits, qh = 106 W/m2.
(5)
The fluid-solid contact surfaces are set to be non-slip and continuous for temperature and heat transfer:
(13)
(6)
Adiabatic boundary conditions are applied to other walls of the computational domain:
(14)
3.3. Data reduction
Reynolds number (Re) is a variable representing ratio of inertial force to viscous force of fluids. Therefore, Re is usually used to determine whether the fluid flow is laminar or turbulent. The Re can be expressed as:
(15)
Where uin is the velocity at the channel inlet with a unit of m/s; Din is hydraulic diameter of cross-section at channel inlet with a unit of mm.
The fluid pressure is a variable related with fluid velocity and is effected by the arrangement of fin structures in channels. In order to analyze the variation of fluids pressure along the flow direction, the local static pressure was given by:
(16)
The friction factor is employed by evaluating the flow performance of microchannel and can be expressed as [43]:
(17)
Where z is length of microchannel with a unit of m; and ΔP denotes the pressure difference between the channel inlet and outlet with a unit of Pa.
The Nusselt number (Nu) represents the ratio of convective heat transfer across the boundary to conduction heat. The Nu is given by:
(18)
Where 
 represents the average convective heat transfer coefficient, and its expression is:
(19)
Where Aw is the coupling wall area with a unit of m2, Afilm is the heating wall area with a unit of m2.
The temperature of the heating wall is an important criterion for evaluating the cooling performance of microchannel heat sinks. The lower the temperature, the safer the operation of electronic devices. The local temperature of the heating wall is defined as:
(20)
As is well known, more uniform temperature of bottom wall maintains a safer operation of high power devices. In order to evaluate the temperature distribution uniformity of bottom walls, the temperature variance of different cells attached to the bottom wall is defined as:
(21)
Where Th,ave is average temperature of bottom wall with a unit of K; Th,I is No.i cell temperature with a unit of K; n is total number of cells attached to the bottom wall.
In order to analyze the irreversible loss caused by the fluid flow and heat transfer in microchannel heat sinks, Bejan [44] proposed the concept of volume entropy generation rate. The total volume entropy generation rate (S) is composed of two parts, including the friction entropy generation rate (S1) and heat transfer entropy generation rate (S2), which can be expressed as [45]:
(22)
(23)
(24)
Where m is the mass flow rate of single microchannel with a unit of kg/s.
3.4. Model verification
To ensure simulation accuracy and save computational costs, further grid independence tests need to be conducted on numerical simulations. The mesh was applied to various microchannel structures, with MCHX-FSTD serving as a representative example, as shown in Fig. 2.

In this study, for the MCHX-FSTD, five calculation models with different grid precisions were constructed, and the grid cell count was approximately 20, 40, 60, and 80 ten thousand elements respectively. Under a constant inlet velocity of 2 m/s, the temperature rise(ΔT = Tout - Tin) and the fave were calculated respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, when the number of grids increased from 20 ten thousand to 40 ten thousand then changed to 60 ten thousand, and finally increased to 80 ten thousand, the relative errors of Nu were 1.48 %, 0.21 %, and 0.13 % respectively. The relative errors of fave are 0.37 %, 0.042 %, and 0.031 % respectively. Based on the analysis, the 40 ten thousand elements model was selected for subsequent simulations.

To validate the accuracy of the numerical methodology, simulation results from MCHX-SC model were benchmarked against experimental data from Chai et al. [46], researchers based on the Navier–Stokes equations and energy equation, are obtained for pressure drop and heat transfer microchannel heat sinks under the same experimental conditions. The MCHX-SC in this study basically follows the geometric design of the straight microchannel heat exchanger described in Ref. [46], and its channel geometric dimensions and other aspects are consistent with the references, presenting geometric comparability. The calculation results are shown in Fig. 4.

The relative errors of Nu obtained through simulation calculation are 10.3 %, 3.1 %, 1.1 %, 0.9 % and 0.91 % respectively. The relative errors of apparent friction factor (fRe) are 0.75 %, 0.14 %, 0.25 %, 0.45 % and 0.5 %. The simulation results agree well with experimental data under the identical dimensions and operating conditions, which verification confirms the model reliability for predicting heat and mass transfer characteristics in microchannel heat sinks.
4. Results and discussions
4.1. Velocity distribution
To understand the hydraulic and thermal mechanism in microchannel with grooves, the flow and heat transfer of the corresponding conventional smooth straight microchannel were also numerically simulated under the same condition and compared with that of new designs. The velocity distribution on the x-z plane (y = 0.2 mm, Re = 560.8) in different channels are shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Velocity contour and streamlines of different microchannels.

The fluid flow velocity at the center of the MCHX-SC initially increases and subsequently remains nearly constant along the flow direction. However, when fluid encounters finned sections, the presence of fins causes repeated contractions and expansions of the channel cross-section, resulting in jetting and throttling effects. These phenomena inevitably induce fluctuations in the flow velocity. In addition, vortices are formed at the trailing edges of the fins, and this flow pattern is closely associated with the thermal enhancement effects [47]. Meanwhile, vortices induce staggered flow patterns within the channel and reduce the flow resistance experienced by the fluid passing through the channel [42], which results in significantly lower fluid velocities in MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM compared to MCHX-SC.
4.2. Pressure distribution
The static pressure distribution on the x-z plane (y = 0.2 mm, Re = 560.8) in different channels are shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Pressure contour of different microchannels.

As shown in Fig. 6, due to viscous losses during fluid flow through the channels, the hydrostatic pressure in all channels continuously decreases along the flow direction. Specifically, the hydrostatic pressure in straight-through channels decreases that approaches a linear decrease, and uniformly along the flow direction. In contrast, for the microchannel with fins, the static pressure between two adjacent fins increases due to the abrupt reduction in channel cross-section. Therefore, a region of adverse pressure gradient forms within the channel. Overall, the hydrostatic pressure in MCHX-UNIFORM along the flow direction is initially lower than that in MCHX-FSTD and becomes higher subsequently. This pressure variation trend is opposite to the velocity variation trend shown in Fig. 5. The arrangement of fins from-sparse-to-dense results in a unique pressure field distribution within the channel. Upstream of the microchannel, MCHX-UNIFORM has denser fins than MCHX-FSTD, which means greater flow resistance and results in a lower static pressure than MCHX-SC. However, as the flow develops downstream, the fin distribution of MCHX-UNIFORM becomes sparse and the flow resistance decreases; At this time, due to the continuous dense arrangement of MCHX-FSTD, the fluid pressure remains at a relatively high level.
4.3. Fluid flow temperature distribution
To analyze the heat transfer characteristics, this study examines the temperature distribution on the bottom wall and the x-z plane (y = 0.2 mm) under the condition Re = 560.8. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the thermal boundary layer in MCHX-SC continuously develops and thickens along the flow direction. In contrast, due to fluid jetting and throttling induced by the fins, the thermal boundary layer in MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM is interrupted and redevelops subsequently. The disruption of the thermal boundary layer enhances heat transfer efficiency, resulting in lower temperatures in MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM compared to MCHX-SC. Furthermore, a higher fin density positively influences heat transfer performance. Therefore, the overheating area of the downstream channel of MCHX-UNIFORM is significantly larger than that of MCHX-FSTD. In the application of heat dissipation for electronic components, the fin arrangement from-sparse-to-dense has more advantages in restricting the overheating area.

Fig. 7. Temperature contour of different microchannels.

In the thermal performance evaluation of microchannel heat exchangers, the bottom wall temperature is directly correlated with the junction temperature of electronic devices and serves as a critical parameter for preventing thermal failure. As shown in Fig. 7(b), wall temperature progressively increases along the flow direction with fluid heating in all microchannels. At the same time, microchannels with fins demonstrate a positive influence on the overall heat exchange performance, it has a lower temperature performance at all positions. The area of high-temperature region in MCHX-SC is significantly larger compared to that in the microchannels with fins. Among them, the area of the overheated zone on the bottom surface of MCHX-FSTD is smaller than that of MCHX-UNIFORM, which maximizes the coverage range of medium temperature and thus shows better temperature uniformity throughout the bottom wall.
The temperature variation profiles of the bottom surfaces for the three microchannels are presented in Fig. 8 at Re = 560.8. The local temperature of MCHX-SC is significantly higher than that of MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM. Both MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM exhibit lower temperature rise rates compared to MCHX-SC. At the exit of the microchannel (z = 10 mm), the temperature of MCHX-FSTD is 6.79 K lower than that of MCHX-SC, and 0.83 K lower than that of MCHX-UNIFORM. This is due to the positive effect of fin arrangements within the channel on enhancing heat transfer performance. Furthermore, when z < 4.2 mm, the bottom surface temperature of MCHX-FSTD is slightly higher than that of MCHX-UNIFORM. When z > 4.2 mm, the opposite trend is observed. This is because the fin distribution in the middle and downstream regions of MCHX-FSTD is denser compared to that of MCHX-UNIFORM. At the microchannel exit, the bottom surface temperature of MCHX-FSTD is lower than that of MCHX-UNIFORM, indicating that MCHX-FSTD outperforms MCHX-UNIFORM in reducing the maximum bottom surface temperature.

Fig. 8. Underside temperature distribution.

Fig. 9 presents the δ2 of different units on the bottom walls of three types of microchannel heat sinks. The δ2 of the bottom wall decreases with increasing Re. This can be attributed by the fact that an increase in fluid velocity enhances the heat transfer performance of the microchannel heat sink, leading to a significant reduction in bottom wall temperature and, consequently, a decrease in temperature variance. Meanwhile, under all operating conditions, the smooth microchannel exhibits the highest temperature variance, while MCHX-FSTD shows the lowest. When Re = 841.2, the temperature variance of MCHX-UNIFORM is 1.47 times greater than that of MCHX-FSTD, with MCHX-FSTD recording only 1.93. Overall, MCHX-FSTD achieves the most uniform temperature distribution on the bottom wall, demonstrating that the from-sparse-to-dense fin arrangement significantly improves temperature uniformity.

4.4. Heat transfer characteristics
Fig. 10(a) illustrates the variation of the fave with Re for different microchannel structures. It can be observed from Fig. 10(b) that microchannels with fins exhibit higher friction factors than the MCHX-SC. When Re = 280.4, the fave of MCHX-UNIFORM and MCHX-FSTD is about 0.36 larger than MCHX-SC. This difference decreases with rising Re, reaching approximately 0.12 when Re = 841.2. The fins increase the effective contact area between the fluid and the solid wall while enhancing the wall shear effect, which leads to a reduction in fluid velocity and velocity gradient, thereby decreasing flow resistance loss. MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM exhibit nearly identical friction coefficients. This similarity can be attributed to the fact that both configurations have the same fluid-solid boundary contact area, resulting in comparable friction losses. Meanwhile, as Re increases, the inertial effect becomes more pronounced while the viscous effect relatively diminishes, leading to an overall decrease in the friction factor.

Fig. 10. Variation of fave and Nu with Re in different MCHX.

Nu serves as a key metric for evaluating heat sink effectiveness. Fig. 10(b) presents the variation of Nu with Re, demonstrating the influence of different microchannel structures on the thermal performance of microchannels.
Fig. 10(b) reveals that the Nu of all structures increases with rising Re, a trend that aligns with classical heat transfer theory. Among these structures, MCHX-SC exhibits approximately linear growth, albeit at a very slow rate. In contrast, MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM which incorporate fins, demonstrate a more rapid increase in Nu with rising Re. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that the presence of fins promotes the formation of fluid vortices. Meanwhile as Re increases, MCHX-FSTD demonstrates significantly greater heat transfer enhancement than MCHX-UNIFORM. When Re = 280.4, the Nu of MCHX-FSTD is 2.8 times that of MCHX-SC, and at Re = 841.2, it increases to 3.5 times. In this study, microchannels equipped with fins enhance fluid disturbance, promote periodic development of the thermal boundary layer, and improve the fluid-wall mixing effect by introducing flow obstacles, thereby significantly increasing the heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the from-sparse-to-dense arrangement increases the flow pulsation through geometric abrupt changes, which can promote fluid pulsation and further enhance heat transfer. When Re = 280.4, the Nu of MCHX-FSTD is 1.02 times that of MCHX-UNIFORM, and it increases to 1.06 times when Re = 841.2. When Re > 700, high flow speed can promote the generation of vortices and increase disturbance with significant heat transfer advantages at MCHX-FSTD, making it suitable for application scenarios with high heat flux.
Khan et al. [48] proposed analyzing the irreversible losses in fluid flow and heat transfer within a channel based on the second law of thermodynamics, using the rate of entropy generation. Entropy generation primarily arises from thermal irreversibility and frictional dissipation. An efficient microchannel thermal system should minimize total entropy generation to enhance system performance and thermal efficiency.
Fig. 11(a) and (b) illustrate the relationship between frictional entropy generation rate (S1), thermal entropy generation rate (S2) with Re. S1 represents irreversible thermal losses caused by frictional resistance. The friction entropy generation rate reflects the irreversible energy loss caused by flow resistance. As Re increasing, S1 of all microchannel heat exchangers rises accordingly. With increasing temperature, the differences in S1 among different types of microchannel heat exchangers become more pronounced. As Re increases, MCHX-SC exhibits a relatively steady linear growth trend with a growth rate of approximately 24 %. In contrast, the friction entropy generation rates of MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM increase at an accelerating pace. When Re reaches 841.2, the S1 value of MCHX-FSTD is 6.47 times higher than that of MCHX-SC. Moreover, the S1 values of MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM are nearly identical. This similarity can be attributed to the equal number of fins and equivalent solid volumes in both designs, resulting in comparable flow resistance characteristics. Furthermore, the S1 values of both MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM are significantly higher than that of MCHX-SC. This is primarily due to the presence of fins, which introduce additional local resistance and consequently lead to greater pressure drop.
The heat transfer entropy generation rate depends on the heat transfer characteristics and is primarily influenced by the temperature difference between the fluid and the heating wall. As the Re increasing, heat transfer within the channel becomes more intense, resulting in a reduced temperature difference between the fluid and the heating wall. Consequently, the heat transfer entropy generation rate in the microchannel decreases with increasing Re. As shown in Fig. 11(b), owing to the enhanced heat transfer performance of microchannels with fins, S2 are significantly lower than that of MCHX-SC. Among the configurations, the difference in heat transfer entropy generation rate between MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM decreases as the Re increases, with MCHX-FSTD exhibiting the lowest heat transfer entropy generation rate.

Fig. 11. Variation of S1、S2 and S with Re in different MCHX.

As shown in Fig. 11(c), the S of all microchannels gradually decreases with an increase in the Re. Furthermore, both MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM exhibit lower total entropy generation rates compared to smooth microchannels; however, the difference in the rate of decline diminishes as the Re increases. Among all configurations, MCHX-SC demonstrates the highest total entropy generation rate, and with a nearly constant decline rate of approximately 38 %. Among the structres, the variation trend of the S in the microchannel heat sink is similar to that of the S2 as the latter constitutes the dominant component of the total entropy generation. The results indicate that microchannel heat exchangers with fins exhibit superior heat transfer performance compared to MCHX-SC. Moreover, compared to MCHX-SC, the from-sparse-to-dense along the bottom wall of channel achieves better thermal performance. The results show that MCHX-FSTD does not simply reduce the loss in a certain aspect, but redistributes the energy dissipation by using the pattern from-sparse-to-dense along the bottom wall of the channel. The fin arrangement with a relatively high coefficient in the upstream can effectively reduce S1 caused by high flow velocity, at the same time increase the density of the fins in the downstream high-temperature area to enhance the jetting and throttling of the fluid, thereby achieving a more valuable reduction in S2. Meanwhile, the streamlined geometric design of the fins can minimize frictional resistance to the greatest extent, enabling more efficient heat transfer is achieved through controllable flow resistance loss, and ultimately the goal of minimizing irreversible loss is realized.
In the research on the arrangement of fins, MCHX-FSTD demonstrated significant advantages. It not only features excellent temperature distribution uniformity and higher cooling efficiency, but also the unique streamlined geometric design of the drop-shaped fins effectively enhanced the heat transfer performance, which was fully confirmed in the entropy generation analysis. However, the research also reveals that there are design limitations: although the arrangement has been optimized, the larger-sized fins currently used will limit the fluid flow rate in the high heat flux density area at the rear end of the channel, resulting in a decline in local convective heat transfer capacity. At the same time, it triggers a relatively high frictional entropy generation, causing significant along-way resistance loss, and ultimately adversely affecting the heat transfer intensity in the downstream overheated area. To enhance the heat transfer performance of MCHX-FSTD, this study will discuss the diameter of the fins to balance the loss of frictional resistance and the heat transfer performance.
4.5. Influence of fin diameter on heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics
As discussed in above section, MCHX-FSTD exhibits the most uniform temperature distribution. To ensure the safe operation of high heat flux electronic components, it is essential to conduct parametric studies on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of MCHX-FSTD. Accordingly, this study further investigates the influence of fin diameter (φ) on the heat transfer performance of microchannels. The geometric configurations of fins with varying φ values are presented in Fig. 12.

In order to deeply explore the internal flow and heat transfer mechanism of MCHX-FSTD with different fin sizes, synchronous numerical simulation studies were carried out on microchannel heat exchangers of different structures under constant Re (Re = 560.8) and the same boundary conditions and the results were systematically compared and analyzed. Fig. 13 shows the velocity distribution cloud map and local streamline diagram in different microchannel structures at the x-z section (y = 0.2 mm).

Fig. 13. Velocity contour and streamlines of different φ.

As can be seen from Fig. 13(a), in all MCHX-FSTD structures, due to the periodic change of the cross-sectional area of the channel by the drop-shaped fins, the fluid will undergo a significant velocity change process when flowing through the fin area. As φ decreases, the flow area at the middle position of the channel relatively increases, resulting in a significant increase in fluid velocity under the same flow rate conditions. The smaller flow resistance formed by the narrower fins enables the fluid to maintain a higher average flow velocity, increasing the average velocity in the superheated area of the microchannel heat exchanger, which is conducive to enhancing the convective heat transfer intensity in this area.
Fig. 13(b) shows the influence of the fin diameter on the evolution of the vortex structure, indicating that when the wider fin cooling medium flows through the fin tail edge, a pair of symmetrical vortex structures will be generated, and a significant flow separation phenomenon will occur between the fin surface and the fluid. As the fin diameter decreases, the characteristics of the streamlined geometric structure become more prominent, and the curvature change of the fin tail edge tends to be gentle, which gradually weakens the flow separation intensity, manifested as the reduction of vortex size and intensity. Although the weakening of this turbulence phenomenon may reduce the effect of radial fluid mixing, it will also decrease the energy loss caused by vortex detachment, which helps to lower the flow resistance. The results show the dual influence of fin size on the flow field structure within the microchannel: a larger fin diameter can generate stronger vortex mixing but comes with a higher pressure drop cost, while a smaller fin diameter optimizes the flow characteristics while maintaining moderate disturbance.
To studies the relationship between the pressure distribution of the microchannel along the flow direction of the cooling medium and the diameter of the fins, the pressure distribution on the x-z plane (y = 0.2 mm, Re = 560.8) in different channels is shown in Fig. 14. The results show that the hydrostatic pressure in all microchannel heat exchangers presents a continuous downward trend along the flow direction, but its specific distribution characteristics and evolution laws vary due to the differences in channel structure and fin size. As φ decreases, the overall pressure drop shows a downward trend. The smaller φ value enables the structural advantages of the streamlined fins to be fully exerted, increasing the proportion of viscous friction loss in the pressure drop composition. Meanwhile, due to the reduction in φ, the variation range of the cross-sectional area between the fins is weakened, which leads to a decrease in the degree of reverse pressure gradient generated in the expansion zone, the flow process becomes smoother, and the pressure drop caused by local resistance and vortex is also reduced accordingly.

Fig. 15 presents the bottom wall temperature distribution curves along the flow direction for MCHX-FSTD with different φ values at Re = 560.8. The periodic variation in channel cross-section leads to temperature fluctuations along the flow path. Due to the identical fin arrangement across all microchannels, the fluctuation patterns among different MCHX-FSTD configurations remain consistent. Overall, under this condition, the MCHX-FSTD with φ = 0.06 mm configuration achieved the lowest temperature level. This occur because the MCHX-FSTD with φ = 0.06 mm the largest heat transfer area with the fluid and features of the most significant cross-sectional area difference, resulting in more pronounced fluid disturbance.

Fig. 16 (a) illustrates the variation of the fave number with Re for MCHX-FSTD structures with different φ fins. It can be observed that MCHX-FSTD with larger φ exhibits a higher fave. This occurs because larger fins provide increased fluid-wall contact area, leading to increased flow resistance. Meanwhile, an increase in φ leads to a reduction in the channel's cross-sectional area. As a result of the sharp rise in flow velocity and the decrease in hydraulic diameter, the shear stress and kinetic energy dissipation at the wall surface are significantly enhanced, ultimately resulting in an increased friction factor. This effect becomes more pronounced as the flow scale decreases [49].

Fig. 16. Variation of fave and Nu with Re in different φ.

Fig. 16 (b) presents the variation curves of the Nu for MCHX-FSTD structures with different φ fins of Re. The Nu of all microchannels configurations increases with rising Re. Specifically, when φ = 0.03 and 0.04 mm, the Nu exhibits an approximately linear increase, albeit at a relatively slow rate, with growth percentages of approximately 9.1 % and 9.6 % respectively. When φ is larger, the Nu of MCHX-FSTD increases more rapidly with rising Re. This is attributed to the fact that a greater variation in channel cross-sectional area promotes the formation of fluid vortices. As Re increases, the enhancement of heat transfer by large-sized fins becomes significantly more pronounced compared to small-sized fins. At Re = 841.2, the Nu for φ = 0.06 mm is 1.78 times higher than that for φ = 0.03 mm.
Fig. 17 illustrates the bottom wall temperature variations in different MCHX-FSTD. As Re increases, heat transfer within the channels becomes more intense, resulting in a decrease in bottom wall temperature and a reduction in temperature variance. Under operating conditions with Re of 280.4 and 420.6, the microchannel with φ = 0.04 mm exhibits the best bottom wall temperature uniformity. However, when Re reaches 560.8, 701, and 841.2, the microchannel heat sink with φ = 0.06 mm demonstrates superior performance in terms of bottom wall temperature uniformity. High-speed fluid flow generates strong turbulence. Wider fins are more effective in disturbing the fluid, disrupting the thermal boundary layer, and promoting uniform heat distribution from the fin base to its tip. Meanwhile, due to enhanced convective heat transfer under high-flow conditions, wide fins can partially mitigate the effect of internal heat conduction masking, leading to a more uniform temperature distribution at the bottom surface.

Fig. 18(a) shows the relationship between the frictional entropy generation rate (S1) and Re for MCHX-FSTD structures with different φ fins of Re. The S1 increases with rising Re. At lower Re, the viscous forces dominate, resulting in minimal variation in S1 across different microchannel configurations. As the Re increases, the near-wall fluid velocity gradient intensifies significantly, leading to increasing divergence in S1 among different microchannels, reducing the fin φ can effectively lower the entropy generation rate under high-flow conditions. When Re = 841.2, S1 with φ = 0.06 mm is 3.4 times higher than that with φ = 0.3 mm. As shown in Fig. 18(b), the heat transfer entropy generation rate (S2) decreases with increasing Re. Under all operating conditions, wider fins exhibit a lower heat transfer entropy generation rate and demonstrate superior thermal performance.

Fig. 18. Variation of S1、S2 and S with Re in different φ.

As illustrated in Fig. 18(c), the total entropy generation rate decreases (S) as the Re increases in all MCHX-FSTD. However, when φ = 0.06 mm and 0.05 mm, as Re increases, the rate of decline in S gradually decreases. When φ = 0.04 mm and 0.03 mm, the decline remains almost stable, stabilizing at approximately 9.5 %. Although large-sized fins offer superior heat transfer entropy generation performance, S1 increases significantly under higher fluid velocities. In contrast, narrower fins can effectively suppress frictional entropy generation, resulting in a nearly linear decrease in S. Under high-flow conditions, narrow fins with φ ≤ 0.04 mm are recommended to balance thermal performance and flow resistance, thereby optimizing the heat dissipation of electronic components. Based on the collaborative study of size and fins from-sparse-to-dense, S shows a nearly ideal linear downward trend with the increase of Re under the conditions of φ = 0.04 mm and φ = 0.03 mm. In the upstream area, adopting a sparse arrangement and reducing the fin size can establish sufficient flow kinetic energy for the fluid. In the downstream area with the highest risk of overheating, appropriately reducing the fin φ can effectively alleviate the high friction loss caused by the dense distribution of fins. Under the premise of a fixed fin arrangement, by reducing the fin φ, local environments with low friction and high heat exchange were created in different sections of the flow channel respectively, ultimately achieving the optimal control of the total entropy production rate at high flow rates.
5. Conclusions
This study proposes a novel method for enhancing heat transfer and improving temperature uniformity in electronic equipment, which can be applied to the design of microchannel heat exchangers. By introducing non-uniformly arranged fins within the microchannels, the results demonstrate that structural optimization still holds significant potential for improving radiator performance. This study proposes a novel microchannel heat exchanger design featuring drop-shaped fins arranged in from-sparse-to-dense along the bottom wall of the channel, aiming to enhance bottom wall temperature uniformity for improved cooling of miniaturized electronic devices. Through numerical simulations, localized hydrothermal characteristics—including fluid flow fields, pressure distribution, Nusselt number, bottom wall temperature variation, frictional entropy generation, thermal entropy generation, and total entropy generation—were systematically investigated within the microchannel heat sinks. The main conclusions are summarized as follows.
(1)
Velocity profiles reveal that vortices and recirculation flows form behind the fins. The fin structures induce velocity fluctuations within the microchannels, where flow inhomogeneity fluid mixing. The sparse area of the upstream fins provides sufficient flow space for the fluid, reducing the friction head loss. The downstream dense area actively disturbs and reconstructs the thermal boundary layer by generating periodic vortices. Taking Re = 560.8 as an example, the average bottom wall temperature of MCHX-FSTD is 11.02 K lower than that of MCHX-SC and 3.1 K lower than that of MCHX-UNIFORM.
(2)
Although finned heat exchangers incur increased pressure drop at the channel bottom, both MCHX-FSTD and MCHX-UNIFORM positively enhance Nu. When Re = 841.2, the Nu of MCHX-FSTD is 3.5 times higher than that of MCHX-SC. Compared to MCHX-UNIFORM, MCHX-FSTD demonstrates superior performance due to its better temperature distribution uniformity and higher cooling capacity.
(3)
Although the S1 of MCHX-FSTD increased slightly, its S2 and S remained the lowest among all the studied configurations. MCHX-FSTD redistributes energy dissipation along the bottom wall of the channel in a pattern from-sparse-to-dense. Adopting a higher coefficient fin arrangement in the upstream can effectively reduce S1 caused by high flow velocity, while increasing the fin density in the high-temperature area downstream, enhancing the jetting and throttling effects of the fluid, make S reach its minimum value. When the Re = 841.2, the S2 and S of MCHX-FSTD are 1.7 times and 2.1 times lower than MCHX-SC respectively.
(4)
Large-sized fins offer superior heat transfer entropy generation performance. When Re = 841.2, the S1 of φ = 0.03 mm is 1.9 times higher than that of φ = 0.06 mm. Based on the collaborative study of size and fins from-sparse-to-dense, S shows a nearly ideal linear downward trend with the increase of Re under the conditions of φ = 0.04 mm and φ = 0.03 mm and stabilizing it at approximately 9.5 %. Therefore, under high flow rate conditions, narrow fins with a diameter of φ ≤ 0.04 mm are adopted to form local environments with low friction and high heat exchange in different parts of the flow channel, so as to achieve the optimal control of the total entropy generation rate at high flow rates.
