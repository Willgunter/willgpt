Abstract
This study examines the impact of boron (B) reinforcement on the corrosion resistance, microstructural properties, mechanical performance, and radiation shielding capabilities of Al-10Sm2O3 composites. Comprehensive characterization studies were carried out by fabricating composites with 0B, 3B, 9B, 15B, 20B, and 30B contents. Density measurements revealed that increased B content increases macro and microporosity, decreasing the relative density. Hardness measurements showed a significant increase in hardness values attributed to the homogeneous distribution of B particles, with the highest hardness value recorded at 259.9 HV in the 30B composite. Wear tests indicate that increasing the B content enhances wear resistance and reduces material loss. Corrosion tests revealed an adverse change in corrosion potential and an increase in corrosion current density with increasing boron (B) content, indicating that B particles negatively affect corrosion resistance by disrupting the continuity of the oxide layer. Radiation shielding analyses performed using MCNP6.2 simulation showed that higher B content increases thermal and fast neutron macroscopic cross sections, whereas gamma-ray attenuation properties decrease. The findings indicate that B reinforcement improved the mechanical and tribological performance but reduced the corrosion resistance. However, the increased thermal and fast neutron macroscopic cross-sections reveal the potential of B-reinforced Al-10Sm2O3 composites for neutron shielding applications.

1. Introduction
Integrating nuclear technologies into various socioeconomic fields, including energy production, medical imaging, space exploration, and industry, has yielded significant advantages. However, the widespread use of these technologies has also underscored the need for effective radiation protection strategies, given the potential risks associated with ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure can have profound biological effects on human health, and long-term exposure can lead to genetic mutations, tissue damage, and diseases such as cancer. Therefore, developing highly efficient radiation shielding materials is essential to ensure safety in nuclear applications [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. The effective attenuation of ionizing radiation depends on the interaction mechanisms of the shielding material used, which vary according to the type of radiation being shielded. For example, alpha and beta particles can be easily stopped by lightweight materials such as paper, plastic, or thin sheets of metal due to their low penetrating ability. However, high-energy types of electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma rays and X-rays, require shields made of denser materials; compounds containing lead, concrete, and barium are often used for this purpose. Neutron radiation, which consists of high-fast neutrons, requires a different shielding mechanism. Moderation (slowing down) and absorption are two fundamental processes that effectively attenuate neutrons [[5], [6], [7]].
Polymer matrix composite materials have attracted considerable interest in recent years as alternative radiation shielding materials due to their low density, flexibility, and easy integration of functional fillers. Hydrogen-rich materials (e.g., water, polyethylene, and paraffin) reduce the energy of neutrons (thermalize them) so that they become lower energy [8,9]. However, complete absorption of the slowed neutrons usually requires elements with a high neutron capture cross-section, such as boron, cadmium, or gadolinium. Boron and boron compounds are widely preferred in neutron shielding applications due to their lightweight and high absorption capacity [[10], [11], [12]].
Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are advanced material systems that contain reinforcing materials dispersed in a metal matrix to improve specific mechanical and physical properties. These reinforcements can be fibers or particles, enhancing the composite's overall performance. MMCs are categorized into different groups based on the matrix material. These include aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), and nickel (Ni) matrices, as well as intermetallic matrices. Aluminum matrix composites (AMCs) are among the most widely used MMCs and offer significant advantages in engineering applications. Aluminum has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure characterized by high plasticity and toughness [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. In addition, it is preferred in many industrial fields due to its good machinability, engineering reliability, and relatively low cost. These properties make AMCs widely used in aerospace, automotive, defense, and structural applications. With the addition of reinforcements, AMCs significantly improve mechanical strength, wear resistance, and high-temperature performance [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. In particular, ceramic-based reinforcements increase the hardness and wear resistance of the material, while metal-based reinforcements can improve the ductility and impact strength of the composite. Therefore, Al matrix composites hold a critical position among engineering materials and are becoming increasingly superior in performance with the continuous improvement of production technologies.
Samarium, which has approximately 2 million tons of reserves worldwide, is mined in various strategic regions, primarily China, Brazil, India, and the United States. This wide geographical distribution directly impacts the sustainability of the samarium supply chain and the market's competitive structure. An effective logistics network on a global scale contributes to a sustainable market structure by ensuring the security of supply between producers and consumers. Regarding neutron absorption capacity, samarium has a higher cross-section than conventional absorbent elements such as boron and cadmium. This feature makes it an effective neutron absorber in nuclear applications. Sm2O3 is notable not only for its neutron-absorbing properties but also for its improved mechanical performance, favorable cost, and vast supply network. Moreover, the binding property of Sm2O3 can contribute to forming a more homogeneous and dense microstructure in composite materials. The favorable interaction between Sm2O3 and the aluminum matrix helps to form a more compact structure by increasing the wettability between the components. This may help improve the composite's overall performance by reducing porosity and increasing structural integrity [24].
In summary, traditional radiation shielding materials such as lead, concrete, and polymer-based composites are among the common solutions, each offering advantages. Although lead exhibits superior photon attenuation capabilities due to its high atomic number, its applications are limited due to its toxic nature and insufficient mechanical strength [25,26]. Concrete offers an effective and low-cost solution against both gamma and neutron radiation, but is disadvantageous in terms of transportation and workability due to its high density and brittleness. Polymer-based composites, especially with boron or heavy element additives, provide lightweight, flexible, and functional solutions against neutron radiation, but are insufficient in terms of mechanical strength and thermal stability [8,9]. The Al-Sm2O3-B hybrid composites developed in this study combine the mechanical advantages of the metal matrix with the high neutron absorption capacity of boron and the partial effectiveness of Sm2O3 reinforcement against gamma radiation. The results reveal that these composites offer a balanced attenuation performance against neutron and gamma radiation and show remarkable superior mechanical properties such as hardness, wear resistance, and structural integrity [24]. In these aspects, Al-Sm2O3-B composites stand out as a more functional and versatile alternative to conventional materials.
The primary objective of this study is to comprehensively assess the impact of B reinforcement on the mechanical, microstructural, corrosion, and radiation shielding properties of Al-Sm2O3 composites. In particular, the mechanical performance parameters, such as density changes, hardness, and wear resistance, of Al matrix composites were investigated due to the increase in B particles. Additionally, the effect of B particles on oxide film continuity was evaluated, and the changes in corrosion resistance were analyzed. The study also examines the radiation shielding performance of the material in terms of photon and neutron interactions. It aims to reveal the effects of B reinforcement, especially in terms of macroscopic cross-section and linear attenuation coefficient. This approach aims to develop high-performance and reliable materials for nuclear waste management and radiation protection applications.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation and characterization
In this study, Al6061 (15–53 µm), Sm2O3 (325 Mesh), and B (325 Mesh) powders with a purity of approximately 99.9 % were commercially available from Nanografi Nano Teknoloji AŞ (Türkiye). The powders were precisely weighed and placed in flasks for ball milling. The grinding process was carried out for 4 h using a Chisun Tech (CN) brand shaker mill. The grinding media comprised an 80 mL hardened steel flask and 15 mm diameter hardened steel balls. The grinding frequency was set at 40 Hz, and the ball-to-powder weight ratio was maintained at 5:1. A 2-minute rest period was applied every 5 min to prevent overheating [24].
After grinding, the powders were uniaxially cold-pressed under a pressure of 720 MPa for 1 min, producing pellets with a diameter of 10 mm. The compacted samples were sintered at 600 °C for 2 h in a Protherm vacuum furnace (Alser Teknik) operating in an argon atmosphere. Following the sintering process, the pellet surfaces were initially ground using SiC abrasive papers ranging from 800 to 4000 grit to achieve a uniform geometry. Subsequently, final polishing was performed using a 1 µm alumina suspension to obtain a smooth and reflective surface suitable for microstructural and surface characterization. After polishing, the densities of the samples were determined using a density measurement kit WSA-224 based on Archimedes' principle. Phase analysis was carried out for structural characterization using a Panalytical Empyrean (Almelo) X-ray diffraction (XRD) device. Surface morphology and elemental compositions were analyzed using an FEI QUANTA 450 scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Brno) and an integrated Oxford X-MaxN 80 energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) system (Oxfordshire).
Vickers microhardness measurements were performed with a Shimadzu HMV-G21 (Shimadzu Corporation) tester under a load of 0.98 N with an impact time of 10 s to determine mechanical properties. Data was collected from 10 points on each sample to improve measurement accuracy, and the average value was calculated. Wear tests were conducted under 8 N load and 100 m sliding distance conditions using a TRIBOtechnic-TRIBOtester device. After the test, the surface areas of the wear marks were measured using a Taylor Hobson 2D profilometer (Leicester), and wear rates were calculated. All wear tests were conducted under controlled ambient conditions, with a relative humidity of 31 %–35 % and a room temperature of 24–27 °C.
The wear rate was calculated using the data obtained from measuring the wear marks, as follows [27].

Electrochemical tests were conducted at 26 ± 2 °C in a 3.5 % NaCl solution within a potential range of −0.5 V to + 0.5 V using a Gamry Reference 1010 E electrochemical workstation (Gamry Instruments). Corrosion rates were calculated using an equivalent weight for each sample. The theoretical densities were determined according to the mixing rule. Furthermore, to present the experimental procedure more clearly and understandably, a schematic arrangement is provided in Fig. 1, where each step is visually represented.

2.2. Monte Carlo simulations
The Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP), developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, is a powerful general-purpose software for particle transport calculations. MCNP version 6.2 (MCNP6.2) can simulate the transport of 37 different particles, including electrons, neutrons, and photons, in complex three-dimensional geometries up to 1 TeV/nucleon. The microscopic interactions of the transported particles with the simulated materials, including processes such as bremsstrahlung radiation, photoelectric absorption, elastic and inelastic scattering, and cross-sections, are calculated through the internal library of the comprehensive code [29,30].
Fig. 2 illustrates the simulation geometry, which consists of a neutron source positioned in a vacuum, a detector measuring the average flux per cm2 per source particle (F4 tally), and the target material. The energies of gamma rays, thermal neutrons, and fast neutrons were determined to be 0.48 MeV, 2.53 × 10−8 MeV, and 2 MeV, respectively, due to neutron-boron interactions. Before each simulation, the free flux Ix, I0, is measured without the target material and with Al-Sm2O3-B composites as the target material. To reduce statistical error, 108 neutron histories were generated in each simulation, and the statistical error was calculated to be less than 1 %. Equation (4) calculates the attenuation rates of gamma rays, thermal neutrons, and fast neutrons. Using the Beer-Lambert law, equations 5–6 were used to calculate the macroscopic cross sections for LAC for gamma rays, thermal neutrons, and fast neutrons. Equations 5–6 were used to calculate the gamma-ray LAC, thermal neutron, and fast neutron macroscopic cross-section using the Beer-Lambert law.

3. Results and discussion
Table 1 summarizes the weight percentages of the composites investigated in this comprehensive study, which have potential uses in various engineering applications. The Al-Sm2O3-B composites synthesized by mechanical milling were analyzed in detail, and the mechanical, physical, and radiation protection properties of the samples with different B additive ratios were comprehensively evaluated (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the composites with the formulation 100-X(Al6061-10Sm2O3)-X(B) (X = 0, 3, 9, 15, 20, and 30) were named 0B, 3B, 9B, 15B, 20B, and 30B, respectively, as indicated in Table 2.

The density measurements presented in Table 2 include the theoretical density values calculated using Equation (7), the experimental density values calculated using Equation (8), and the average experimental values with their corresponding standard deviations for Al-Sm2O3-B composites, along with their relative densities.
The analysis results reveal a gradual decrease in theoretical and experimental density values as the B content increases. Still, there is an initial increase in the relative density, which tends to decrease after a certain point. For example, for the 0B composite, the theoretical density was 2.895 g/cm3, the experimental density was 2.622 g/cm3, and the relative density (calculated using Equation (8) was 90.59 %. When the B content was increased to 15B, the relative density reached 91.42 %. However, the relative density decreased to 89.23 % for the 30B composite at higher B contents. This suggests that up to a certain proportion of B initially contributes to the composite's densification. Still, at higher proportions, the consolidation of the powders becomes difficult due to the increase in hard and low-density B particles. Increasing the B content can negatively affect the compressibility of the powders, thereby increasing microporosity, which can decrease relative density. However, this limited decrease in relative density can be explained by the binding effect of Sm2O3. Sm2O3 formed an interphase by coating the surface of Al powders during the milling process, thereby preventing serious wettability problems that become more pronounced as the B content increases.
Importantly, all corrosion, mechanical property analyses, and MCNP simulations were performed using the experimentally measured densities, which account for the actual porosity and microstructural characteristics of the composites rather than relying solely on theoretical density values. This approach improves the accuracy of the results and better represents the real behavior of the materials.
As a result, only a minimal decrease in relative density was observed despite different B ratios, indicating that the binding effect of Sm2O3 enabled the composites to be produced in a more homogeneous and dense structure. Equation (8) was used in the relative density calculations, and the validation provided by this equation allows for a better understanding of the relationship between theoretical and experimental densities. Improving composites' mechanical and physical properties directly relates to this homogeneous and dense microstructure.

3.1. XRD analysis
The XRD analyses presented in Fig. 3 confirm the presence of Al, Sm2O3, and B phases, indicating the chemical stability of the composites. These results reveal that no unwanted reaction products are formed during sintering or other processes, maintaining the stability of the components [[31], [32], [33]]. With increasing boron reinforcement, a significant increase in the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the B phase was observed. This indicates that the B phase is more actively and homogeneously distributed in the composite structure and contributes to structural stability. On the other hand, Sm2O3 phase peaks, which were observed with high intensity, especially in 0B and 3B composites, weakened as the boron reinforcement increased and completely disappeared in some samples in composites above 20B. This peak intensity variation is related to the distribution of boron around Sm2O3 particles and their potential morphological interactions.

However, since XRD data alone cannot provide sufficient information on microstructure homogeneity, the analysis results were supported by SEM and EDX data. In the SEM images in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, it is observed that as the B content increases, the agglomeration tendency of Sm2O3 particles decreases and the structure gains a more homogeneous phase distribution. Furthermore, in the post-wear surface SEM-EDX analysis of the 30B composite presented in Fig. 11, the boron element was detected on the surface, indicating that the B phase maintains its structural continuity. These microstructural changes were consistent with the observed increases in mechanical properties (especially hardness and wear resistance). Indeed, the increase in the intensity of the B phase in the XRD peaks with the increase in boron content was directly correlated with the mechanical properties. In conclusion, when XRD findings, SEM-EDX analysis, and mechanical test data are evaluated together, it is understood that boron reinforcement improves composite performance by optimizing both phase structure and microstructure.

3.2. SEM-EDX analysis
SEM and EDX analyses reveal the microstructural homogeneity and phase distribution of Al-Sm2O3-B composites with different ratios produced by mechanical milling. The micrographs presented in Fig. 4 were analyzed at various magnification levels. It was found that the general morphological structure was similar between Fig. 4(a-b) and (d-f), but significant morphological changes were observed with increasing boron (B) reinforcement. Especially in the samples with low B content, Sm2O3 particles were observed to exhibit larger sizes and an irregular distribution on the matrix. In contrast, with increasing B content, Sm2O3 particles showed smaller sizes and a more homogeneous distribution. This can be explained by the fact that the hard B particles are broken down and better consolidated in the matrix due to the mechanical grinding effect. Increasing B content improved mechanical properties by increasing the hard particle ratio and microstructural homogeneity.
In the SEM images, it is observed that the gray regions represent the Al matrix, the white areas represent Sm2O3 particles, and the dark gray regions represent the B phase. Comparing Fig. 4, Fig. 4, it is noteworthy that with the increase of B reinforcement, the hard phases spread more finely and homogeneously within the matrix. This is also consistent with the data obtained from density analysis since the relative density remains high, indicating that the powders are effectively consolidated and the microstructure becomes more compact. EDX analysis confirmed the distribution of elements in the composite. The homogeneous distribution of B in the matrix is visible in the mapping images. However, the analysis of elements with low atomic numbers (such as B, Li, Be, C, O, and F) by EDX is challenging. The characteristic X-rays of light elements have low energy levels, limiting their detection by the detector. Therefore, some deviations were observed between the initial powder composition and the EDX results [34].
In summary, the SEM-EDX analyses confirm that increasing B content significantly affects the microstructural characteristics of the composite and improves the phase distribution. These findings reveal that Al-Sm2O3-B composites produced by mechanical milling present homogeneous phase distribution. These structural improvements directly impact mechanical strength, wear resistance, and density, enabling composites to perform more effectively in engineering applications.
3.3. Density and microhardness measurements
Fig. 7 illustrates the changes in relative density and hardness of Al-Sm2O3-B composites. The experimental results show that the hardness values increase significantly with increasing B content in Al-Sm2O3-B composites, but the relative density decreases. This increase in hardness is attributed to the high hardness of B and its homogeneous dispersion within the matrix. In contrast, the decrease in relative density is attributed to the increased B content, which promotes micropore formation.

Fig. 7. Comparison of microhardness and relative density of Al-Sm2O3-B composites.

According to the data presented in Fig. 7, the relative density for composite 0B is 90.590 %, while a partial increase in relative density is observed until composite 15B. The values of 90.92 % for 3B, 91.25 % for 9B, and 91.41 % for 15B are reached. This tendency indicates that a lower B content improves the microstructure of the composite, increasing the inter-particle fullness ratio and facilitating the formation of a tighter structure. However, a downward tendency in relative density is observed when the B content exceeds 15B. It decreased to 90.37 % for 20B and 89.23 % for 30B. This decrease can be attributed to several key factors. With increasing boron content, the probability of nucleation of macropores along the B particles increases. As the density of B particles in metal matrix composites (MMCs) increases, the interparticle contact surface area expands, directly affecting the bonding quality within the composite [35,36]. In particular, particle bonding becomes looser in composites with a high B content, decreasing relative density. Moreover, it is observed that the void (porosity) ratio in the composite increases with the increase of B particles. The dispersion of B particles in the powder matrix may reduce the bonding between particles beyond a certain level, forming porous regions. Additionally, the hardness of the powder particles increases with increasing boron content. The increase in hardness reduces the bonding ability during the pelletizing process, decreasing density [22]. This effect is particularly pronounced in composites with high B content.
Experimental hardness measurements significantly improve hardness values with increasing B reinforcement. The hardness value, measured as 83.69 HV for the 0B composite, increased to 259.9 HV for the 30B composite. The hardness values for composites 3B, 9B, 15B, 20B, and 30B were 108.4 HV, 116.6 HV, 173.9 HV, 221.1 HV, and 259.9 HV, respectively. This significant increase in hardness values can be attributed to the high hardness of B particles, which improves the mechanical properties of the matrix and increases the load-carrying capacity. Due to their high hardness, B particles cause a noticeable increase in hardness values when dispersed in the composite structure. However, the relative density tends to decrease with increasing stiffness. This indicates that the primary factor contributing to increased hardness is the hardness characteristic of the B particles; however, the relative density decreases beyond a certain point due to increased porosity. As a result, increasing B content significantly increases the hardness values of the composite but causes the relative density to decrease after a certain level. This tendency emphasizes the importance of ensuring the homogeneous distribution of B particles and determining the optimal pressing conditions in the production process.
Fig. 8 shows the wear rate and resistance values of Al-Sm2O3-B composites. The wear behavior of Al-Sm2O3-B composites shows significant changes with the increase in B content. Wear resistance and wear rate are critical parameters for the material's mechanical strength and surface integrity. The data presented in Fig. 8 demonstrates the effect of B reinforcement on the wear mechanism. While the wear rate is 0.00279 mm3/m for the 0B composite, this value decreases to 6.40 × 104 mm3/m for the 30B composite. In parallel, the wear resistance increases from 4,301.49 N.m/mm3 for the 0B composite to 18,732.44 N.m/mm3 for the 30B composite. These results show that B reinforcement significantly changes the wear mechanism on the material surface. The main reason for these changes is that B particles mechanically strengthen the composite structure and reduce material loss at the surface.

Fig. 8. Wear Rate and Wear Resistance of Al-Sm2O3-B composites.

Boron plays a vital role in wear mechanisms with its low density and high hardness. When B particles are homogeneously distributed in the aluminum matrix, they optimize the load distribution in the contact zones on the surface, making the material more resistant to abrasive forces. The significant decrease in wear rate and the sharp increase in wear resistance, especially from composites 9B and 15B, indicate that B particles are effectively dispersed in the composite matrix above a critical threshold. The high B content limits plastic deformation during wear, reducing the damage caused by abrasive loads on the material surface. Additionally, B particles appear effective in providing resistance to abrasion, thereby reducing material loss on the surface by interacting with abrasive particles. However, the decrease in relative density in the 30B composite requires a different perspective on the wear mechanism. The high B content may increase the void ratio in the composite, potentially leading to bond weaknesses at specific points, which could complicate the material's wear mechanism. However, when the overall results are evaluated, B reinforcement effectively enhances the wear resistance and significantly improves the composite's wear resistance.
In conclusion, increasing B content in Al-Sm2O3-B composites reduces the wear rate, making the material more resistant to abrasive effects. This improvement is directly related to the homogeneous distribution of B particles in the matrix, the protective effects on the surface, and the more even distribution of abrasive loads.
Fig. 9 presents SEM images of the wear surfaces of Al-Sm2O3-B composites with different proportions of B reinforcement. As seen in Fig. 9(a-b), the surfaces of the samples with low boron content (0B and 3B) show bright wear debris and dark contrasting regions. EDS analyses show that these inclusions are Al2O3 and Sm2O3 particles separated from the matrix and incorporated into the friction interface. The dark contrasting areas indicate oxide layers usually formed during wear. As mentioned in previous studies, such oxide layers are usually formed in the early stages of wear due to the temperature increase caused by friction [37,38]. In the later stages of wear, these oxide layers are predicted to disintegrate and act as abrasives at the interface. However, the tests performed under constant sliding distance did not transition to such advanced wear mechanisms. Therefore, oxidative wear is the dominant wear mechanism in samples containing 0B and 3B. In samples 9B and 15B, where the boron reinforcement increased, it was observed that the wear debris accumulated more prominently on the surface and delamination marks appeared in these areas. This is attributed to increased material hardness due to increased boron reinforcement. The increase in hardness increases the plastic deformation resistance under applied load and accordingly increases the probability of surface damage types such as fracture/delamination [39].

In addition, a characteristic surface deformation pattern, called “smeared”, was commonly observed on the corroded surfaces of these specimens. As the boron content increases, the shear effect between the hard boron particles and the soft aluminum matrix phase at the interfaces makes such deformation marks more pronounced. This microstructural contrast promotes a more intense plasticity-based wear behavior on the material surface, especially compared to composites containing only Sm2O3 reinforcement [40,41]. The literature reports that fatigue-induced cracks are formed in the later stages of such spot wear mechanisms and that these cracks cause delamination from the material surface [42].
Fig. 10, Fig. 11 show SEM-EDX analysis of the wear surfaces of composites 0B and 30B, respectively. The steel ball easily abraded the 0B composite, and the EDX results confirm that the steel ball was not abraded; instead, only the composite was abraded due to excessive particle breakage. In composite 30B, on the other hand, the wear mechanism changed; the wear was concentrated on the opposite surfaces, and EDX analysis revealed that Fe and C elements from the steel ball were deposited on the surface during wear. Additionally, oxidation occurred on the surface, indicating an increase in the wear resistance of the composite. All these results confirm that the wear tests and SEM-EDX analysis are in agreement with each other.

3.4. Electrochemical corrosion test
The electrochemical behaviour of Al-Sm2O3-B composites was studied using potentiodynamic polarization tests. Fig. 12 presents the polarization curves of the composites, and Table 3 lists the main parameters, including corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr), and corrosion rate. The corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (Icorr) values reveal that the electrochemical stability of the composites decreases as the B content increases. The corrosion potential of −678 mV for 0B composite decreases to −810 mV for 30B composite. This progression shows that B reinforcement weakens the Al matrix's electrochemical stability and increases the tendency for corrosion.

The corrosion current density also increases with B content, from 3.7 µA/cm2 for the 0B composite to 27.8 µA/cm2 for the 30B composite. Similarly, the corrosion rate increases from 0.04 mm/year to 0.34 mm/year. This tendency suggests that the increase in B and Sm2O3 particles disrupts the continuity of the protective oxide film layer in the Al matrix, thereby reducing the composite's corrosion resistance [[43], [44], [45], [46]]. It is known that boron doping initially contributes to passive film stability by reducing oxygen vacancies in the oxide film [47]. However, as the B content increases, structural distortions occur with the saturation of B3+ ions in Al2O3 and Sm2O3 lattice structures, which creates discontinuity, microstructural voids, and heterogeneous areas in the oxide film [[48], [49], [50]]. This increase in voids in the composite structure triggers pitting corrosion by facilitating the formation of local electrochemical cells. Indeed, in our study, it was observed that as the B content increased (0B → 30B), the corrosion current density increased from 3.7 µA/cm2 to 27.8 µA/cm2, and the corrosion rate increased from 0.04 mm/year to 0.34 mm/year. Furthermore, the decrease in the re-passivation potential and the narrowing of the negative hysteresis also reveal that the self-repair ability of the passive film decreases with boron. All these findings suggest that high boron content disrupts the continuity of the protective film, leading to more severe progression of both general and localized (pitting) corrosion [51,52].
More specifically, the value of Icorr in composite 3B is 5.57 µA/cm2, and the corrosion rate is 0.06 mm/year. However, as the B content increased to 9B, the Icorr value increased to 13,68 µA/cm2, and the corrosion rate increased to 0.15 mm/year. This variation indicates that B particles undergo phase separation within the matrix, forming corrosion cells. For the 15B composite, the Icorr increased to 17 µA/cm2, and the corrosion rate increased to 0.19 mm/year. These values for the 20B composite were calculated as 23.05 µA/cm2 and 0.27 mm/year, respectively. Finally, the 30B composite exhibits the highest corrosion rate and the lowest corrosion resistance, with an Icorr of 27.89 µA/cm2 and a corrosion rate of 0.34 mm/year.
These results show that increasing B reinforcement increases the amount of voids (porosity) by decreasing the density ratio in the composite. Increased porosity causes aggressive ions to penetrate the material more efficiently, accelerating corrosion. Additionally, potential differences arise at the interfaces between the B particles and the Al matrix, triggering the galvanic corrosion mechanism [53,54]. Increasing B content decreases the corrosion resistance of Al-Sm2O3-B composites. The increase in porosity, caused by the B particles disrupting the continuity of the protective oxide film structure, and the decrease in density, adversely affect the electrochemical stability of the composites. These findings suggest that appropriate surface coating or different matrix modifications are required to optimize the corrosion resistance of B-reinforced composites.
3.5. Neutron and gamma radiation shielding properties
The data presented in Fig. 13 show the thermal neutron macroscopic cross-section values and attenuation ratios of 2 mm thick Al-Sm2O3-B composites. A significant increase in the thermal neutron macroscopic cross-section values and attenuation ratios was observed with increasing B reinforcement. In particular, the macroscopic cross-sectional value of 5.44 cm−1 for the 0B composite increased to 29.66 cm−1 for the 30B composite. Similarly, the neutron attenuation rate increased from 65.23 % for 0B to 96.66 % for the 30B composite. This tendency indicates that neutrons are absorbed more efficiently with increasing B (B10: 3847 barn) content in the composite. Sm2O3 (Sm: 5704 barns), a ceramic component known for its high neutron absorption cross-section, initially significantly contributes to the composite's neutron absorption capacity. However, with increased B content, the Sm2O3 ratio decreases, and B largely dominates the neutron interaction. This is mainly due to the low neutron absorption cross-section of Al (Al: 0.23 barn) and the increased effectiveness of B4C in the composite matrix. Since aluminum is a weak absorber in neutron interactions, the total neutron attenuation performance of the composite improves significantly as the B content increases [55].

These results indicate that neutron interactions become more prominent with increasing B content due to boron’s exceptionally high neutron absorption cross-section. While Sm2O3 contributes significantly at lower B contents, increasing B concentration shifts the primary shielding mechanism toward boron-dominant interactions. As a result, both the macroscopic neutron cross-section and the attenuation rate increase progressively, reaching a maximum in the 30B composite. This trend highlights the effectiveness of boron in enhancing the radiation shielding performance of the Al-Sm2O3-B.
Fig. 14 shows the fast neutron macroscopic cross-section and fast neutron attenuation rates of Al-Sm2O3-B composites. The fast neutron MaCS and attenuation ratios gradually increase with increasing B content. The fast neutron MaCS value of 0.182 cm−1 for the 0B composite increased to 0.207 cm−1 for the 30B composite. Similarly, the neutron attenuation rate increased from 30.6 % for 0B to 34.3 % for the 30B composite. The fast neutron MaCS value for the 3B composite was 0.191 cm−1, and the neutron attenuation rate was 32.90 %. It reached 0.193 cm−1 and 33.2 % for the 9B composite and 0.195 cm−1 and 33.4 % for the 15B composite. These findings suggest that the distribution of B in the composite directly contributes to the neutron interaction mechanism. The 20B and 30B composites exhibit the highest performance regarding fast neutron attenuation. For 20B, the fast neutron MaCS value was 0.198 cm−1, and the attenuation rate reached 33.9 %. For the 30B composite, a fast neutron MaCS value of 0.207 cm-1 and an attenuation rate of 34.3 % were obtained. This increase suggests that B is a crucial component in neutron interaction processes and that increasing B while decreasing Sm2O3 positively affects neutron attenuation performance. Additionally, increased B content produces more light elements in the composite's chemical composition. In particular, light elements such as hydrogen (H) play a critical role in scattering processes that effectively reduce the energy of fast neutrons [56,57]. The high neutron scattering cross sections of light elements allow neutrons to interact more and lose a significant fraction of their energy. In this context, increasing the B content improves the neutron moderation ability of the composites, allowing fast neutrons to be slowed down more effectively. As a result, increasing the B content improves the fast neutron attenuation performance by enhancing the composite's neutron scattering and absorption capacity. Accordingly, Al-Sm2O3-B composites can potentially optimize neutron interaction mechanisms in nuclear radiation shielding and reactor applications.

Fig. 14. Fast neutron macroscopic cross-section and attenuation rate graph of Al-Sm2O3-B composites.

Fig. 15 shows the linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) and photon attenuation ratios of Al-Sm2O3-B composites for photons with an energy of 0.478 MeV. A significant decrease in LAC and photon attenuation ratios is observed with increasing B content. The LAC value of 0.215 cm−1 for the 0B composite decreased to 0.192 cm−1 for the 30B composite. Similarly, the photon attenuation ratio decreased from 33.54 % for the 0B composite to 31.74 % for the 30B composite. This decrease is related to the change in the average atomic number of the composite and its corresponding decrease in density. The LAC value for the 3B composite was 0.203 cm−1, and the photon attenuation rate was calculated to be 32.34 %. The 9B composite reached 0.201 cm−1 and 32.19 %; for the 15B composite, it reached 0.198 cm−1 and 32.04 %. This tendency reveals the effect of the increase of B in the composite on the photon interaction mechanisms. Composites 20B and 30B show the lowest photon attenuation coefficient and attenuation ratio values. For 20B, the LAC value was 0.195 cm−1, and the attenuation ratio decreased to 31.95 %. For the 30B composite, a LAC value of 0.192 cm−1 and an attenuation ratio of 31.74 % were obtained. This decrease is attributed to a reduction in the photon interaction capacity of B due to its low atomic number and a decline in the overall photon attenuation performance of the composite. As the concentration of Al and Sm2O3 decreases with increasing B content, the average atomic number of the composite also decreases. The interaction of photons with the material depends mainly on the atomic number and density. Light elements such as B have a lower capacity to interact with photons than elements with high atomic numbers. Therefore, increasing the B content decreases the overall photon attenuation capacity of the material by reducing the probability of photon scattering and absorption.

As a result, increasing the B content decreases the photon attenuation performance of Al-Sm2O3-B composites. This indicates that the photon interaction mechanisms depend on the composite's atomic structure and density. Therefore, optimizing the B content at a certain level is necessary to protect protective materials against photon radiation.
4. Conclusions
In this study, 100-X(Al6061-10Sm2O3)-X(B) (X = 0, 3, 9, 15, 20, and 30) composites were successfully fabricated and thoroughly characterized. Structural analyses confirmed the presence of Al, Sm2O3, and B phases, revealing that microstructural homogeneity improved with increasing B content. Mechanical tests showed that B reinforcement significantly improved the wear resistance and hardness. The adhesive wear pull-out particle mechanism was dominant in specimens with low B content, while abrasive wear was prominent in specimens with high B content. Increasing B content resulted in a more homogeneous morphology on the wear surfaces and enhanced the load-carrying capacity. However, a partial decrease in relative density occurred due to the low density of B.
Corrosion tests revealed that the corrosion resistance of the composites decreased with increasing B content. This is due to the increase in micropores formed by B particles and the formation of more active sites on the surface. Radiation shielding analyses showed that B and Sm2O3 reinforcement improved the thermal neutron attenuation performance by increasing the macroscopic cross-section. Still, due to the low atomic number, the B reinforcement partially decreased the mass attenuation coefficient (LAC) values. These results indicate that Al-Sm2O3-B composites offer significant potential for advanced engineering and radiation protection applications as a material with high wear resistance, hardness, and improved thermal neutron attenuation capabilities.
Overall, including boron in the 9–20 wt% range offers an optimum balance between radiation shielding efficiency and mechanical performance, creating a promising compositional window for multifunctional shielding applications. The developed Al-Sm2O3-B composites have potential uses in applications requiring mechanical strength and radiation shielding, such as in nuclear energy systems, medical radiation treatment equipment, and aerospace.
