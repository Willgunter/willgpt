Abstract
A systematic numerical investigation is conducted to examine the influence of curved rectangular vortex generator (CRVG) placement on the thermal performance of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. Transverse, longitudinal, and circumferential offsets are considered to identify configurations that maximize heat transfer while maintaining acceptable flow resistance. The results show that a transverse offset of Δz = 1 mm achieves the best overall performance in the Reynolds number (Re) range from 400 to 5000, the Nusselt number (Nu) increases by up to 34.2 %, while performance evaluation criterion (JF) first increases and then decreases, reaching its maximum value of 1.32 at Re = 1000. A longitudinal offset of Δx = 2 mm yields a peak JF of 1.30. Circumferential placement exhibits the strongest influence. Here, Δβ represents the circumferential offset angle. The optimal circumferential position for heat transfer enhancement depends on Re, with the highest JF of 1.29 occurring at Δβ = 0° for Re = 1000, whereas Δβ = +15° yields a JF of 1.18 at Re = 2000, reflecting enhanced heat transfer performance at higher Re. A strong dependence of Nu on secondary flow intensity (Se) is also established, confirming that vortex-induced secondary flow is the key mechanism governing heat transfer augmentation. Furthermore, empirical correlations relating Nu, friction factor (f), and JF to Re and CRVG positioning parameters are developed, providing practical tools for preliminary design, performance assessment, and optimization of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers.

1. Introduction
Circular-tube-fin heat exchanger is widely applied in power, chemical, air-conditioning, electronics and other equipment due to their compact design and robust heat transfer performance. With the application in more fields, further improvement in heat transfer performance is an urgent problem to be solved at present. From the structural point of view, this type of heat exchangers is mainly composed of tubes with fins. A high-temperature fluid flows inside the tube, while fins are attached to the outer surface, so that heat is transferred through the tube wall and dissipated via the expanded fins surfaces. To meet the growing demand for more compact and efficient heat exchangers, it is necessary to enhance heat transfer performance, which enables better utilization of heat exchange surfaces and improves overall system efficiency in today's energy-conscious environment.
On the outer surface of the tube, heat transfer is often constrained by high thermal resistance, and numerous fin configurations have been proposed to improve performance. Lee et al. [1] and Chu et al. [2] studied wavy fins with elliptic or circular tubes, while Yoo et al. [3] and Nuntaphan et al. [4] analyzed the thermal–hydraulic characteristics of louvered fins under various geometric parameters and inclination angles. Zhang et al. [5] emphasized the significant influence of longitudinal tube spacing in trapezoidal slit fin heat exchangers, Whereas Su et al. [6] compared slit styles showing different ranges of enhancement. However, as noted in Refs. [7,8], trade-offs persist between fin structural strength and heat transfer enhancement. To further address these limitations, the incorporation of vortex generators (VGs) has been proposed as an effective strategy for enhancing overall heat transfer performance.
Research has consistently demonstrated that incorporating vortex generators into fins is a readily manufacturable and highly effective passive technique for enhancing heat transfer in compact and circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. By modifying the flow field and inducing longitudinal vortices, VGs suppress wake regions, disrupt thermal boundary layers, and promote fluid mixing, thereby reducing overall thermal resistance. A wide variety of VG geometries has been investigated, including trapezoidal, rectangular, as well as more advanced designs such as perforated, curved, wavy, and even flexible “flag” structures. Winglet-type vortex generators (WVGs) have been widely recognized as an effective means of enhancing the thermal performance of fin–tube heat exchangers. Early studies demonstrated that longitudinal vortices generated by winglet structures can significantly disrupt boundary layers, enhance fluid mixing, and thereby improve convective heat transfer performance [9,10]. Three major enhancement mechanisms have been identified—boundary layer deformation, swirl formation, and flow destabilization—with optimum attack angles typically ranging from 30° to 45° [11]. Collectively, these findings highlight that VG design and optimization remain a promising pathway for improving the thermal and energy efficiency of next-generation compact heat exchangers.
Trapezoidal vortex generators, along with their modified and combined configurations, have been extensively investigated for their heat transfer enhancement potential. Zhou et al. [12] investigated the effect of curved trapezoidal winglet-type vortex generators on heat transfer and fluid flow. They reported that the curved trapezoidal winglet pair had the best overall performance in the full turbulence region due to its streamlined configuration and low pressure penalty, suggesting that such vortex generator (VG) designs are advantageous for enhancing the heat transfer. Rishikesh et al. [13] and Saini et al. [14] demonstrated that geometric optimization and perforations features can significantly improve thermal–hydraulic performance, with six-hole trapezoidal designs showing the most favorable results. Lin et al. [15] further reported that performance was maximized at a 90° attack angle and a radial position of 1.8 times the tube diameter. Salviano et al. [16] conducted a SIMPLEX-based optimization of fin–tube heat exchangers with longitudinal vortex generators and found that the optimized configurations outperform previous designs, especially in staggered tube arrangements. The study showed that suitable VG geometries and a VG height–to–fin-pitch ratio of 0.6 are most effective, while the optimal parameters vary significantly with Reynolds number, tube arrangement, and performance objectives. More generally, optimization techniques such as Response Surface Methodology and Artificial Neural Networks have also been applied to trapezoidal and related geometries, with reported improvements in the Nusselt number (Nu) of up to 60 % under acceptable pressure drops [17].
Delta-winglet vortex generators (DWVGs), along with their improved and combined variants, have also attracted considerable research attention owing to their relatively low pressure penalties. Song et al. [18] showed that reducing tube spacing enhanced heat transfer at the cost of higher resistance, while Wu et al. [19] experimentally demonstrated that tube bank fin heat exchangers equipped with curved delta-winglet vortex generators (CDVGs) can achieve significantly higher heat transfer than plain fins, with the optimum performance obtained at the largest fin pitch and the smallest tube diameter, largely independent of Reynolds number (Re). Shi et al. [20] demonstrated that curved triangular VGs improved Nu by 15–44 % with only a 12–16 % pressure penalty. Saini et al. [21] found that perforated delta VGs with six holes yielded heat transfer increases of 42–77 % depending on Re. Variants such as wavy or concave deltas have also proven effective: Song et al. [22] observed a 44.9 % increase in Nu with wavy deltas, while Saini et al. [23] showed seven-wave deltas enhanced heat transfer by 75–85 % but at the expense of large pressure losses, partially mitigated by porous holes. Syaiful et al. [24] further demonstrated that concave delta designs enhanced convective heat transfer coefficients by over 50 % but with a corresponding 70 % increase in resistance. Overall, delta winglets generally outperform rectangular designs in terms of thermal enhancement [11,25]. Luo et al. [26] and Wan et al. [27] examined wavy fins combined with delta VGs, reporting maximum thermal performance coefficients of 1.0 at a 23° attack angle and 1.29 at 60°, respectively. Menéndez Pérez et al. [28] studied louvered fins with delta VGs and found diminishing returns beyond 50°. Moreover, delta-winglet VGs in flat-tube-fin heat exchangers have been extensively investigated. Song et al. [29] systematically analyzed the effect of placement and orientation, showing that the transverse distance between VGs strongly influences the interaction of longitudinal vortices and consequently the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics.
Rectangular vortex generators (RVGs), along with their improved and combined configurations, are widely recognized for their ability to suppress wakes and generate stable longitudinal vortices. Naik et al. [30] conducted three-dimensional numerical investigations on rectangular winglet vortex generators in fin–tube heat exchangers and showed that optimal winglet placement, attack angle, and Re (2000–10,000) markedly enhance heat transfer and thermo-hydraulic performance by strengthening secondary flows and reducing entropy generation. In a related study, Naik et al. [31] found that the concave and convex configurations of curved rectangular winglet vortex generators significantly modifies secondary flow structures, thereby influencing the Nu, friction factor, and overall thermal performance. These studies highlight the decisive role of secondary flow behavior in vortex-induced heat transfer enhancement. Sun et al. [32] found that multiple RVGs generated multiple vortices simultaneously, increasing the thermal enhancement factor (TEF) to 1.27. Zeeshan et al. [33] highlighted the importance of geometric placement, showing that locating RVGs at the tube rear with a 5° span angle yielded the best performance. Structural modifications such as perforations have been studied by Modi et al. [34,35] and Han et al. [36], who found that six holes or a 5 mm hole diameter provided the best balance of Nu and pressure drop. Geometric variations also contribute: Batista et al. [37] showed curved RVGs improved the TEF by 6.6 %, Modi et al. [38] reported that up-wavy RVGs offered the highest performance, and Zhao et al. [39] demonstrated that combining straight and curved RVGs performed best at a 30° span angle and a 100° arc. Numerical studies have confirmed that optimized RVG configurations can deliver 5–7 % increases in heat transfer and substantially higher thermal performance values, with only moderate pressure penalties [40,41]. Finally, composite and hybrid VG–fin structures represent a promising research direction. Dezan et al. [42] confirmed that adding RVGs to louvered fins further enhanced performance. The addition of RVGs to the louvered fins further enhanced heat transfer relative to plain fins. Fahad et al. [43] compared hybrid designs and showed that a configuration of one RVG with three delta VGs achieved the best thermal performance, with TF values of 1.13–1.32. Collectively, these results highlight that while individual VG geometries improve heat transfer by 15–77 %, hybrid structures may offer the most balanced approach between heat transfer gains and hydraulic penalties. The authors [44] experimentally investigated circular-tube-fin heat exchangers with rectangular and trapezoidal vortex generators, and found that fins combining VGs with flow re-distributors outperformed plain fins, with CRVG fins performing slightly better at low Re and curved trapezoidal vortex generators (CTVG) fins superior at higher Re. Novel and flexible VGs have also been proposed. Gallegos et al. [45] reviewed the use of flexible plates (“flags”) as vortex generators, noting their potential for thermal enhancement but emphasizing the need for further experimental validation.
According to the above-reviewed literature, winglet-type vortex generators are widely recognized as effective devices for enhancing heat transfer, and are frequently employed in circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. In particular, CRVGs can effectively suppress wake regions, generate stable longitudinal vortices, and thus intensify thermal boundary layer disruption and fluid mixing, leading to improved convective heat transfer performance. Nevertheless, research on the geometric positioning and systematic optimization of CRVGs remains limited. To bridge this gap, the present study focuses on CRVGs in circular-tube-fin heat exchangers, with an emphasis on the effects of transverse, longitudinal, and circumferential arrangements on flow structures and thermo-hydraulic performance. Numerical simulations are conducted to elucidate the correlations between CRVG configurations and key performance indicators such as the Nu, friction factor(f), and comprehensive evaluation criteria (JF). The results are expected to provide both theoretical understanding and practical design guidelines for integrating CRVGs into circular-tube-fin heat exchangers, thereby contributing to the development of compact, high-performance, and energy-efficient heat exchange systems for a wide range of industrial applications.
2. Physical model
The present study develops a model of a circular-tube-fin heat exchanger consisting of fins and four rows of circular tubes arranged in a staggered transverse configuration, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The overall structure of the heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 1(a), while Fig. 1(b) illustrates the circular-tube-fin heat exchanger with CRVGs, and Fig. 1(c) provides the details of tubes and vortex generators. In this model, the CRVGs are initially positioned symmetrically on both sides of the circular tube Fig. 1(b). The structural parameters of the heat exchanger with CRVGs are: the outer and inner diameters of the circular tube are D0 = 8.9 mm and Di = 7.7 mm, giving a tube wall thickness of δt = 0.6 mm. The height of CRVG is HCRVG = 2.0 mm. The fin spacing and thickness are Fp = 2.4 mm and δf = 0.12 mm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(c).

3. Mathematical model
3.1. Governing equations and parameter definitions
Considering the nominal operating conditions of the heat exchanger in the locomotive engine, this study investigates flows within a Reynolds number range of 600–5000 [20]. In accordance with the experimental findings reported in Refs. [18,44], flows with Reynolds number Re ≤ 1000 are classified as laminar, whereas those with Re > 1000 are considered turbulent. The airflow in the channel is idealized to simultaneously satisfy the continuity, momentum and energy equations. For the turbulent regime, the RNG k-ε turbulence model is adopted, as it has been shown to be effective in predicting complex flow structures and heat-transfer behavior in channels equipped with vortex generators. Under the operating conditions of the heat exchanger, this modelling strategy ensures that both laminar and turbulent flow regimes are represented accurately.

3.2. Boundary conditions
The inlet boundary conditions are specified as a velocity-inlet, while the outlet boundary conditions are defined outflow boundary. At the inlet, the turbulence quantities for the RNG k–ε model are calculated using standard empirical relations based on the inlet velocity uin and the turbulence intensity I. The turbulent kinetic energy k is evaluated as
(22)
while the turbulence dissipation rate ε is determined by
(23)
where Cμ = 0.0845 and Dh denotes the hydraulic diameter. The turbulence intensity at the inlet is specified using the widely accepted correlation:
(24)
At the outlet, the outflow boundary condition assumes a fully developed profile, and zero-gradient conditions are applied for all flow variables. The computational domain is configured as illustrated in Fig. 3 to accurately simulate the actual operating conditions of the heat exchanger. The inlet velocity was prescribed as a uniform profile without an extended entrance section to ensure consistency with the experimental conditions used for validation. A 30-mm extension section is added to the rear of the numerical model. Symmetry boundary conditions are applied on the left and right sides of the extension. The fin and tube surfaces were prescribed with an isothermal wall boundary condition, whereas the solid walls of the extended section were treated as adiabatic. As a result, the solid fin domain was not modeled, and heat conduction within the solid was neglected. The working fluid was air, whose density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat were evaluated at the mean temperature of the wall and inlet temperatures. This extension helps prevent flow recirculation behind the circular tubes and CRVG, allowing for a more realistic simulation of actual operating conditions and improving the accuracy of the numerical calculations. The values given on the boundary conditions are presented in Table 2.

4. Model validation and grid independence verification
In this study, the computational domain is first discretized using high-quality structured meshes in ANSYS ICEM, followed by fluid flow simulations in ANSYS Fluent 2020R1 [46]. The finite volume method is applied for the control equations and the pressure-based SIMPLEC separation algorithm is selected. The simulations were considered converged when the residuals of continuity, momentum, k, and ε fell below 1 × 10−6, and the energy residual fell below 1 × 10−8.
Meshing was performed in strict accordance with the software usage tutorial [46] to ensure the accuracy of the numerical calculations. The grid system diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The enhanced wall treatment is employed for the turbulence model, which requires the near-wall mesh to satisfy y+ ≈ 1. According to the Fluent 20.0 user manual [46], such near-wall resolution is necessary to accurately capture the viscous sublayer and ensure the reliability of turbulence predictions. In this study, a near-wall mesh with a first-layer height satisfying y+ ≈ 1 and a growth rate of 1.2 is adopted to maintain sufficient resolution while ensuring smooth mesh transition away from the wall.

To verify grid independence, comparisons were made between Nu and f values obtained at different grid resolutions under turbulent conditions (Re = 3000) for varying longitudinal positions (Δx = −1mm, Δx = 0 mm, Δx = 1 mm). This approach enabled a more convincing selection of grid resolutions for subsequent numerical simulations. Comparing Nu and f across grid sizes of 30 × 104, 60 × 104, 120 × 104, 240 × 104, and 480 × 104, as shown in Fig. 5, reveal maximum deviations of 2.58 % for Nu and 2.88 % for f. To optimize computational efficiency without compromising results, a grid size of 120 × 104 was selected.

The grid convergence index (GCI) was evaluated using Richardson extrapolation [47,48] to assess grid quality. The GCI is defined as:
(25)
where, FS is the safety factor and is equal to 1.25 [47], r is the grid refinement ratios, p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm, and ε is the relative error. Other parameters are as follows: Us is the secondary flow characteristic velocity, defined as:
(26)
(27)
(28)
(29)
where, φ1, φ2, and φ3 are numerical solutions on the fine, medium, and coarse grids with grid spacing h1, h2, and h3, respectively. Using the mesh sizes of 4,792,080, 1,207,020, and 326,934 at Δx = 0, the GCI values calculated were 0.304 and 0.296.
To ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulations, the numerical results were compared with experimental data from the authors’ previous work [44], as shown in Fig. 6. Three turbulence models were selected for comparison with the experimental results. For Nu, the deviation decreases as Re increases. At Re = 800, a relatively large deviation occurs due to experimental measurement uncertainties; however, for all cases with Re > 1000, the deviation is less than 5 %, the RNG k-ε model showed a maximum deviation of 4.9 %. In comparison, both the Standard k-ε and Realizable k-ε models showed slightly larger discrepancies. For the Nu, the larger deviations occur mainly in the laminar regime due to sensitivity to thermal entrance-length effects, and uncertainties in air velocity measurements. However, the deviation of f increases as Re increases, the RNG k-ε model showed a larger maximum deviation of 15.44 % in f. This deviation is mainly attributed to the experimental measurement configuration: in the reference experiment, the pressure taps were positioned some distance away from the inlet and outlet boundaries, causing the measured pressure drop to include entrance losses, partial contraction and expansion losses, and developing-flow losses. These additional losses elevate the experimental friction factor, particularly at higher Re, making the CFD predictions appear lower across all turbulence models. Considering the overall deviations in both Nu and f, the RNG k-ε model was ultimately selected for the numerical simulations and result analysis due to its comparatively better agreement with the experimental data.

5. Results and discussion
This paper numerically studies the effect of CRVG positional variations — including transverse, longitudinal, and circumferential positions, as shown in Fig. 2 — on the flow and heat transfer enhancement of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. The effects of these three position parameters on the temperature field, flow field, local Nu distribution and overall thermal performance are discussed in detail at different flow velocities. These structures induce longitudinal vortices that enhance the mixing of hot and cold fluid in the air-side channel of the circular-tube-fin heat exchanger. More importantly, adjusting the position of the vortex generators significantly affects the strength and structure of the induced secondary flow. These secondary flows play a dominant role in thermal boundary layer disruption and convective enhancement, which directly affects the overall heat exchanger performance. At the same time, the relationship between the local secondary flow intensity and the heat transfer performance Nu is studied, which provides an important reference for revealing the heat transfer enhancement mechanism of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers with different position parameters.
5.1. Flow and thermal field analysis
Fig. 7 illustrates the selection of two cross-sections, x-y and x-z, to facilitate the analysis of fluid flow in the heat transfer channel. The x-y cross-section is positioned at the center of the finned heat transfer channel, and the x-z section is located at the 2 mm section behind the CRVG in the finned heat transfer channel.

5.1.1. Velocity vectors and absolute vorticity contours
In order to study the secondary flow development and mainstream disturbance under different position parameters, the velocity vector and vorticity contours on the y-z cross section were investigated. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the velocity vector and longitudinal vortex on the y-z cross section with the different longitudinal position of CRVGs. Fig. 8 (a) illustrates the velocity vector diagram of the change in longitudinal position from Δz = -2 mm to Δz = 2 mm. It can be seen from the figure that when Δz = 2 mm, the vortex induced by CRVG is small. As Δz gradually decreases, the vortex induced by CRVG gradually increases, and the position of the vortex core also moves away from the circular tube. The main reason is that when Δz = 2 mm, the CRVG is close to the circular tube, and the vortex behind the circular tube has an impact on the longitudinal vortex induced by the CRVG, which is not conducive to the generation and development of the longitudinal vortex.

In order to more clearly quantify the intensity of the vorticity, Fig. 8 (b) shows the contour distribution of the absolute vorticity on different y-z cross sections when Δz varies from 2 mm to −2 mm. It can be clearly seen from the figure that the absolute vorticity is larger on the upper and lower surfaces of the fin, and the absolute vorticity is also larger.
Fig. 9 presents the velocity vector distribution(a) and absolute vorticity contours (b) on the y–z plane for five different longitudinal positions of CRVGs. These positions correspond to configurations Fig. 9, where the position of the CRVG gradually moves from downstream to upstream along the mainstream direction. From the velocity vector distribution diagram, it can be seen that the longitudinal position of the CRVG has little effect on the development of the secondary flow. In Fig. 9, strong and well-organized vortex structures are formed in the channel behind the CRVG regardless of the longitudinal position as Δx varies from Δx = 1 mm to Δx = -2 mm. These longitudinal vortices enhance the mixing between the hot and cold fluid flows, resulting in swirling motions at the channel height. The associated flow disturbances extend top and bottom the fin surface, indicating effective boundary layer disruption. In contrast, the CRVG in Δx = 2 mm, which is placed closer to the upstream side of the tube, the CRVG located near the upstream side exhibits relatively weakened vortex intensity and reduced flow disturbance, which may be caused by the proximity of the vortex generator to the low-speed wake region behind the tube, resulting in the decay of vortex intensity.

These observations are further quantitatively confirmed by absolute vorticity contours. Fig. 9(b) show extensive regions of high vorticity near the upper and lower walls, indicating the presence of a strong shear layer and vigorous vortex activity. These high vorticity zones correlate with areas of enhanced heat transfer. The CRVG at Δx = 2 mm, on the other hand, exhibits weaker vorticity intensity with relatively undisturbed flow. This behavior is attributed to the interaction between the CRVG-induced vortices and the developing boundary layer.
Fig. 10(a) show the velocity vector distribution at various circumferential positions of the CRVG installed around the fin surface and the absolute vorticity contours on the y–z cross section, respectively. The relative position Δβ varies from 20° to −10° along the z-direction. These figures visualize the evolution of secondary flow structures as the circumferential positions of the CRVGs changes. As shown in the figure, the circumferential position has a significant effect on the intensity and structure of the induced secondary flows.

As shown for Δβ = 20°and Δβ = 15°, under large attack-angle variations, the longitudinal vortices generated by the CRVG are relatively weak, the fluid motion in the transverse section is limited, and the disturbance to the thermal boundary layer is also restricted. In this case, the airflow basically follows the main direction, with only a slight deflection near the fin surface. When the CRVG is positioned near the transverse sides of the tube, as in cases with Δβ = 10°, Δβ = 5°, Δβ = 0°, Δβ = -5°, Δβ = -10°, strong longitudinal vortices develop, promoting cross-channel swirling motion and enhanced interaction with the thermal boundary layer on both the upper and lower walls. This leads to more uniform flow disturbance and effective heat transfer enhancement across the channel width.
The vorticity contours further confirm these observations, as shown in Fig. 10 (b). Circumferential placements near the sides of the tube generate larger regions of high vorticity near both upper and lower channel walls, indicated by more intense red zones. This reflects stronger shear layers and sustained vortex structures. On the other hand, placements along the top/bottom centerline show localized or diminished vorticity, with smaller vortex cores and limited interaction with the surrounding flow.
5.1.2. Streamlines and temperature fields
To more closely investigate the heat transfer enhancement mechanism for different CRVG locations, the temperature field and flow field structure are analyzed comprehensively. The color scale indicates the temperature field, and the black lines with arrows indicate the flow streamlines. Fluid flow streamlines and temperature variation in cross-section c1 between plain fins and fins with CRVGs are shown in Fig. 11. The temperature gradually increases as the fluid flows towards the outlet, and the increase is more pronounced when there is interference from CRVGs.

Fig. 11. Streamlines and temperature on c2 at Re = 5000 for different Δz.

In the case of the plain fin, the streamlines are relatively smooth, and the wake region behind the circular tube is the largest, as shown in Fig. 11(plain fin). In this configuration, the mainstream temperature field exhibits a gradient from blue to green, indicating a relatively thick thermal boundary layer and limited mixing between hot and cold fluid regions. The temperature remains relatively high behind the circular tube due to the wake, where the fluid cannot flow downstream efficiently. As a result, the downstream region of the circular tube is uniformly heated with little thermal disturbance.
As shown in Fig. 11, when the transverse position is set to Δz = 2 mm and Δz = 1 mm, the wake region behind the circular tube is significantly reduced, and no obvious recirculation zone is observed behind the CRVGs. This indicates that at this position, the CRVGs effectively interfere with the wake formation, suppressing flow separation behind the tube. When the CRVG is closer to the circular tube, the temperature contours become more distorted, and cold fluid penetrates deeper into the near-wall region. This reflects stronger fluid mixing and a thinner thermal boundary layer. Consequently, the flow is more uniformly distributed, and the boundary layer near the tube and fin surfaces is more frequently disrupted, thereby enhancing local convective heat transfer.
In contrast, at Δz = 0 mm, −1 mm, and −2 mm, as the CRVG shifts further away from the circular tube, the streamlines exhibit noticeable changes in trajectory. The disturbance of the fluid flow becomes weaker and the flow resistance decreases, but the wake region behind the circular tube gradually expands, negatively affecting heat transfer performance. Specifically, at Δz = −1 mm and Δz = −2 mm, a wake area appears behind the CRVG. This flow behavior leads to a weakening of the disturbance effect of the thermal boundary layer, thereby reducing the convective heat transfer efficiency.
Fig. 12 shows the temperature contours and streamlines in the x-z plane for six configurations corresponding to different longitudinal positions of the CRVGs, ranging from Δx = 2 mm to Δx = −2 mm. In configuration Fig. 12, without the CRVG, the flow remains relatively smooth, with only a weak recirculation region behind the tube. When the longitudinal position of the CRVG shifts from Δx = 1 mm to Δx = −2 mm, significant vortex structures are generated, as illustrated in Fig. 12. At Δx = 1 mm and Δx = 0 mm, where the CRVG is located downstream relative to the circular tube centerline, the wake region behind the tube is reduced but still remains. As a result, the thermal boundary layer gradually develops along the surface, resulting in limited convective heat transfer. When the CRVG changes upstream, as shown in at Δx = −1 mm and Δx = −2 mm, these structures enhance the mixing of cold and hot fluids, which is reflected in the more twisted and curved streamlines near the wall and more obvious temperature gradients.

Fig. 13 presents temperature contours and streamline distributions at c1 when Re = 5000 at different circumferential positions of CRVG. It is observed that the wake area behind the circular tube decreases regardless of whether the vortex generator moves clockwise or counterclockwise along the circumference. The temperature distribution of the fluid on c1 becomes more uniform, indicating that the thermal mixing is more effective due to the enhanced vortex activity induced by the CRVG.

Fig. 13. Streamlines and temperature on c2 at Re = 5000 for different Δβ.

The temperature contours at different CRVG circumferential positions show the development of the thermal boundary layer, the intensity of the temperature gradient, and the overall heat distribution. As the parameters of the CRVG circumferential position change, obvious differences in the wall temperature uniformity and the thickness of the thermal boundary layer can be observed. As shown in Fig. 13, when Δβ = 15°, the more uniform temperature and thinner thermal boundary layer on the cross section indicate improved convective heat transfer, especially in the downstream area of the vortex generator.
5.2. Distribution of Nulocal on the top and bottom fin surfaces
To clearly distinguish the effect of CRVGs on the heat transfer performance at different transverse positions, Fig. 14 illustrates the Nulocal on the bottom fin and the top fin when Δz varies from 2 mm to −2 mm. For plain fin, the distribution of Nulocal the regions with Nulocal > 35 are mainly concentrated at the inlet and in front of the circular tube. At the entrance, the fluid enters the channel without a developed thermal boundary layer, resulting in negligible convection heat transfer thermal resistance and a very high Nulocal. In front of the circular tube, a collision between the fluid and the tube causes some fluid towards the upper and lower fins, disrupting the existing thermal boundary layer and thereby enhancing the heat transfer efficiency.

Fig. 14. Nulocal on the top and bottom fins at Re = 5000 for different transverse positions of CRVG. (a) top; (b) bottom.

On fins with CRVGs, apart from the inlet and the front end of the circular tube, high Nulocal areas are distributed on the inner side of the CRVGs due to the CRVGs induced secondary flow of the fluid. Meanwhile, High Nulocal regions are distributed on the outer side of the CRVGs, due to the pressure exerted by the rotating flow of the longitudinal vortex induced by the CRVGs. Both mechanisms improve the heat transfer performance by enhancing secondary flow. The area where Nulocal > 35 is the largest in the first row of CRVGs. This area decreases in the second row, and nearly disappears in the third and fourth rows, being replaced by where Nulocal < 35. This indicates that the intensity of secondary flow and longitudinal vortices induced by CRVGs in the third and fourth rows are weaker compared to the first two rows. This difference is mainly due to momentum loss caused by resistance during fluid flows, which lacks the necessary conditions for forming strong secondary flow and longitudinal vortices. Comparing the Nulocal > 35 areas in CRVGs at various transverse positions shows the largest areas at Δz = 1 mm and Δz = -1 mm. However, the Nulocal area in the wake region behind the circular tube at Δz = 1 mm is smaller than at Δz = -1 mm. Considering factors like reducing the wake region, enhancing the secondary flow and generating a strong longitudinal vortex, Δz = 1 mm may be the optimal transverse location for improving the heat transfer performance.
Fig. 15 shows the distribution of six local Nusselt numbers Nulocal along the z direction for the top and bottom surfaces of the CRVG at different longitudinal positions. As the longitudinal position Δx varies from 2 mm to −2 mm, a significant change in the local distribution of Nu can be observed, indicating that the longitudinal position of the CRVG has a significant impact on the local thermal performance. On the top surface, high Nulocal regions appear in front of the tube and in the vicinity of the CRVG, indicating that the flow mixing is strong and the local vortex is increased in these regions. These regions become more obvious at the intermediate positions (Δx varies from 1 mm to −1 mm), where the flow may be most disturbed, thereby enhancing the convective heat transfer. The bottom surface also shows a similar trend, although the distribution is not the same, indicating that there is an asymmetry in the heat transfer capacity between the top and bottom walls. Specifically, the high Nulocal region on the bottom surface is slightly elongated and offset, which may be caused by the difference in boundary layer separation caused by the channel geometry. Nulocal near the CRVG behind the third and fourth tubes is significantly lower than that on the upper surface because a relatively small space is formed between the CRVG and the tube, which is not conducive to the development of secondary flow. Overall, the figure shows that the CRVG position induces a complex flow structure, which significantly affects the local heat transfer characteristics of the two surfaces and exhibits obvious spatial variations and asymmetries, which are driven by the longitudinal position and surface orientation.

These locations correspond to the upper and lower surfaces of the heat exchanger at different angular locations, revealing how the convective heat transfer characteristics vary along the circumference of the CRVG location. From location Δβ varies from Δβ = 20°to Δβ = −5°, the Nu distribution pattern changes significantly.

On both surfaces, locations Δβ varies from Δβ = 15°to Δβ = 5° show extended high Nu regions, especially near the downstream side of the CRVG and around the vortex-induced flow reattachment zone. These regions indicate strong flow disturbances and enhanced heat transfer due to the secondary flow generated by the CRVG structure. In contrast, locations Δβ = 20°and Δβ = 15°located near the structure boundary or symmetry plane generally show weaker thermal enhancement and lower Nulocal values. In addition, there is a clear asymmetry between the top and bottom surfaces. Although the approximate locations of the high Nu value regions correspond between different surfaces, the intensity and shape of the distribution vary, reflecting the three-dimensional flow dynamics and the inhomogeneous interaction of the vortices with the channel walls. For example, at positions Δβ = 0°and Δβ = −5°, the top surface tends to have more concentrated and longer high Nu stripes than the bottom surface, indicating local flow acceleration and enhanced boundary layer disturbance. Overall, this figure highlights the significant effect of circumferential position on the heat transfer performance of the CRVG structure.
5.3. Effect of CRVG position parameters on Nus and Ses
5.3.1. Impact of Δz on Nus and Ses
To study and analyze the heat transfer characteristics in the channel in detail, Fig. 17 illustrates the distributions of Nus and Ses at different locations of the channel as the transverse position of the CRVGs varies. The figure reveals that under the influence of CRVGs, Nus is very high near the inlet while Ses is low. However, Nus and Ses trends become similar after the fluid passes the first row of circular tubes. The variation of Nus is consistent with the results presented by Nulocal, and Ses is very low at the inlet due to the absence of disturbance to induce a secondary flow. When the fluid encounters the wall of the tube, Nus increases rapidly, reaches a peak and then starts to decrease again. This phenomenon occurs because the fluid generates a secondary flow when it first encounters the wall of the circular tube, thereby enhancing the heat transfer. This behavior is consistent with the trend presented on the Ses plot. Nus increases rapidly again when the fluid encounters the CRVGs, and different transverse transverse positions lead to variations in Nus. The peak Nus of 37.7 occurs after the first row of CRVGs at Δz = 2 mm. At the same position on the fins at Δz = -1 mm, differences can reach up to 9 %, and the Nus increases by 53 % compared to that at the same position on the plain fins. After reaching the maximum value of Nus near the first row of CRVGs, it gradually decreases. Nus reaches its minimum value in front of the second row of round tubes, forming a cycle, and then the same trend is shown in the second, third and fourth rows. Comparing Nus at different transverse positions shows a clear gap in Nus at different positions of the channel, while Ses consistently peaks at Δz = -2 mm near the CRVGs in the second, third and fourth rows, except near the first row where gaps are minimal. Comparing peak locations s of Nus and Ses shows that Ses also reaches its maximum in the regions where Nus peaks. The corresponding relationship between Se and Nu indicates that the secondary flow intensity determines the heat transfer intensity for circular-tube-fin heat exchanger equipped with CRVGs.

5.3.2. Impact of Δx on Nus and Ses
Fig. 18 shows the variation of Nus and Ses as the longitudinal position of the CRVGs changes. Excluding the inlet section, the Nus and Ses trends remain consistent in other channel areas. The mean Nus value and Ses trend are both largest at Δx = −2 mm. Compared to the plain fins, both Nus and Ses are significantly larger where CRVGs are added to the fins than in the plain fins at the same position. The fins with CRVGs produce an intense longitudinal vortex-enhanced heat transfer for Nus, and CRVGs induce the fluid to produce a secondary flow-enhanced heat transfer for Ses. Secondary flow could not be generated without fluid disturbance on the plain fins. Compared with the case with the interference of CRVGs, the extreme value of Ses under the influence of the first row of CRVGs is 86.35 % different from the extreme value on the plain fins at the same position. It is clear that CRVGs can induce the generation of strong secondary flow for enhanced heat transfer.

5.3.3. Impact of Δβ on Nus and Ses
Fig. 19 shows the variation of Nus and Ses at different parts of the channel for varying attack angles. In comparison to the plain fin, the Nus and Ses at different attack angles are larger than those obtained on the plain fin. The average Nus and Ses peak at Δβ = −10°, with maximum enhancement can be up to 55.78 % and 84.4 %, respectively. This indicates that a smaller attack angle can enhance the secondary flow intensity, generate longitudinal vortices, and reduce the wake region behind the tube, consequently leading to an improvement in heat transfer. The variations of Nus and Ses with attack angle exhibit a clear correspondence, indicating that CRVGs play a key role in generating strong secondary flows, which promote fluid mixing and enhance heat transfer.

5.4. Effect of CRVG position on Nu, f, and JF
To accurately analyze the impact of various positional parameters of CRVGs on heat transfer performance, an in-depth study was conducted on the fluid flow and heat transfer within the channel.
5.4.1. Influence of transverse offset Δz
Fig. 20 shows the variation of Nu, f, Nu/Nu0 and f/f0, and JF for CRVGs at different transverse positions and with varying Re. From Fig. 20(a) and (b), the trend indicates that Nu gradually increases with the increase of Re, while f gradually decreases. The largest difference between Nu at Δz = 1 mm and on plain fins occurs at different Re, reaching up to 52 %. Comparing the f at different transverse positions with that on the plain fin, it can be seen that the difference is the smallest at Δz = 2 mm, and the average difference is maintained within the range of 29.8 %–50.47 %.

Fig. 20. Comparison between Nu, f and JF of CRVGs at different transverse positions. (a) Nu; (b) f; (c)Nu/Nu0 and f/f0; (d) JF.

Fig. 20(c) shows the variation of the Nusselt number ratio Nu/Nu0 (solid line) and the friction factor ratio f/f0​ (dashed line) with the Re for different fin CRVG offset distances (Δz). Compared to the plain fin, all modified configurations enhance heat transfer, with Nu/Nu0​ values greater than 1. The highest heat transfer enhancement is achieved for the case of Δz = 1 mm, followed by Δz = 0 mm and Δz = -1 mm. However, this improvement comes at the expense of increased flow resistance, as reflected by the elevated f/f0​ values. Among all configurations, Δz = -2 mm shows the highest friction losses despite a moderate heat transfer gain, while Δz = -2 mm has the lowest overall performance. Fig. 20(d) shows the JF calculated based on the comprehensive performance, when JF > 1, it indicates that it can play a role in strengthening the heat transfer; the larger JF indicates that the degree of strengthening the heat transfer performance is higher. As the Re increases from the laminar to the turbulent flow regime, JF first increases and then decreases, reaching a maximum value of 1.32 at Re = 1000 for Δz = 1 mm. According to the JF calculated at different Re, Δz = 1 mm is the largest, and JF is still greater than 1.02 at the lowest, which is a considerable improvement in heat transfer performance. Except for Δz = 1 mm and laminar flow, the JF obtained at all other transverse positions is greater than 1.1, indicating that the addition of CRVGs is beneficial in enhancing heat transfer within the range studied. Compared to Δz = 1 mm when the average JF is maximum, Δz = -2 mm is the lowest with a maximum difference of 7.55 %, then Δz = 1 mm is more favorable for practical application.
5.4.2. Influence of longitudinal offset Δx
A similar analysis to that used for the transverse position change was used in order to analyze the mechanism of enhanced heat transfer in CRVGs when the longitudinal position was changed. The mechanism of enhanced heat transfer at longitudinal position change was finally obtained.
Fig. 21 shows the Nu, f, Nu/Nu0 and f/f0, and JF of CRVGs with varying longitudinal position. From Fig. 21(a), it is obvious that Nu increases with the increase of Re, following a consistent trend. The difference between across Δx ranges from 1.55 % to 4.52 % for Nu. Compared with the plain fins, the Nu at Δx = −2 mm can increase by up to 50.04 %. Fig. 21(b) depicts the variation of f with increasing Re for CRVGs at different longitudinal positions. As Re increases, f gradually decreases, reaching its minimum at Re = 5000. At Δx = -2 mm, f is at its maximum indicating the fluid is subjected to maximum friction coefficient when the CRVGs are distributed here. This results in excessive momentum loss, hindering adequate heat transfer in the rear section of the channel. The average f is the smallest at Δx = 0 mm, but the difference with the maximum f on the plain fin is still up to 49.75 %.

As shown in Fig. 21(c), the case with Δx = –2 mm shows the most significant heat transfer improvement, but also results in the highest friction losses, as evidenced by the larger values of f/f0. In contrast, the cases with Δx = 1 mm and 0 mm show more modest enhancements with relatively small increases in friction. Overall, the figure highlights the trade-off between heat transfer enhancement and flow resistance, emphasizing the need to carefully optimize Δx to achieve a good balance in terms of thermal-hydraulic performance. JF was selected as the evaluation factor to determine the optimal longitudinal position for heat transfer, as shown in Fig. 21(d). The minimum average JF was obtained at Δx = 2 mm, but JF was greater than 1.02 at different Re, indicating improved heat transfer at the studied longitudinal positions. The JF at Δx = 0 mm and Δx = -1 mm do not differ much and are higher than those obtained at the other positions. The largest JF is obtained at Δx = -1 mm for 2000<Re < 5000, indicating that the distribution of CRVGs improves the heat transfer the most at this location. When 400<Re < 2000, the JF obtained at Δx = 0 mm is the largest, suggesting this initial position favors heat transfer at low Re.
5.4.3. Influence of circumferential offset Δβ
In the same way as for the transverse and longitudinal position changes, the heat transfer mechanism of the CRVGs was analyzed for the attack angle changes. Trends of Nu, f, Nu/Nu0 and f/f0, and JF were analyzed as the Re increased at different values of Δβ, as shown in Fig. 22. Nu increase with increasing Re and decreasing Δβ. Nu reach maxima at Δβ = −10° for all Re, achieving enhancement of 55.22 % and 22.44 %, In comparison to the plain fins, respectively. The simultaneous presentation of Nu at different Δβ indicates the most significant enhancement of heat transfer occurred at Δβ = −10°. Fig. 21(b) shows that the average f is the largest at Δβ = −10°, indicating that f increases while increasing Nu. Compared to the plain fin, the increase in friction coefficient f at Δβ = 20° is not significant and only increases by a maximum of 28.64 %, but the maximum increase in f can be up to 51.94 % at Δβ = −10°.

As shown in Fig. 22(c), both heat transfer and flow resistance are significantly affected by the change in attack angle. Negative offset angles, especially Δβ = −10°, can significantly improve Nu/Nu0, while positive offset angles (such as Δβ = 20°) can achieve more modest gains. However, these improvements come at the expense of increased flow resistance, which is also reflected in the friction coefficient ratio f/f0, which exceeds 1 in all cases. When Δβ = −10°, the friction loss is the largest, while configurations with smaller offset angles (such as Δβ = 15° or Δβ = 20°) result in relatively low increases in f/f0. The JF obtained to acquire the best heat transfer performance at different attack angles is shown in Fig. 22(d), where the JF values are all greater than 1.1. For 2000<Re < 5000, JF is the highest at Δβ = 15°, exceeding those at other Δβ, with a maximum enhancement difference of up to 7 % compared to Δβ = −10°. For 400<Re < 2000, the highest JF values are obtained at Δβ = 5° and Δβ = 0°. Analysis of JF across different Re shows that it initially increases with increasing Δβ and then increases under laminar flow conditions. However, under turbulent flow conditions, JF decreases as Re increases. The maximum JF of 1.29 obtained at Re = 1000, Δβ = 0° implies that Δβ = 0° is more conducive to enhanced heat transfer at low Re. However, as Re increases beyond 1000, the optimal circumferential position shifts to Δβ = +15°, where JF reaches 1.18 at Re = 2000. Therefore, Δβ = +15° is identified as the most effective placement of the vortex generator for maximizing heat transfer performance in higher Reynolds number regimes.
The maximum value of JF is obtained at Δβ = 10° for Re = 2000 and except for Δβ = −10° and Δβ = 20° the value of JF is also maximum for other Δβ. The value of JF is also maximum. Considering the industrial applicability, it is mainly used under turbulent flow conditions, Δβ = 15° is recommended for achieving optimal heat transfer performance in heat exchanger.
5.5. Relationship between secondary flow intensity and Nu
Fig. 23(a) illustrates the variation of the Nu and the Se with increasing Re. As Re increases, both Nu and Se show a consistent upward trend, indicating that enhanced flow intensity contributes to improved heat transfer performance. To gain deeper insight into the underlying mechanism, the study systematically investigated how different placements of the CRVGs affect this relationship. By varying the CRVGs’ positions, a strong and direct correlation between Se and Nu was observed, emphasizing the critical role of secondary flow in heat transfer enhancement.

As shown in Fig. 23(b), an empirical linear relationship between Nu and Se was obtained through curve fitting. Under laminar flow conditions, the empirical formula is given as follows:
(31)
Under turbulent flow conditions, the empirical formula is given as follows:
(32)
where the coefficients 0.196 and 0.5463 were determined by data fitting during laminar flow. The error range for this linear fit ranged from +5 % to −5 %. The 0.107 and 0.6524 are fitting coefficients determined from the data during turbulence flow. The errors associated with this linear fit were within +6 % and −10 %, indicating strong agreement between the predicted and actual data. This high degree of correlation demonstrates that secondary flow strength can serve as a reliable predictive parameter for estimating heat transfer performance in systems with CRVGs. The resulting empirical equation not only deepens the understanding of flow–thermal interactions but also provides a valuable reference for the design and optimization of enhanced heat exchangers in practical engineering applications.
5.6. Correlation development
A comprehensive analysis is performed to explore how different location parameters affect flow and heat transfer characteristics. Rather than studying each parameter individually, this approach considers multiple parameters simultaneously. This method is more effective for predicting and evaluating performance because it reflects the combined effects of all relevant factors. To describe the relationship between these parameters and system behavior, a suitable curvilinear model is chosen. This model better captures nonlinear trends compared to a simple linear fit, illustrating how changes in location parameters influence results such as the Nu, f and JF.
The accuracy of the model is ensured by defining an objective function that minimizes the difference between the model's predicted values and the actual data. Under laminar flow conditions, the objective function is expressed as:
(33)
(34)
(35)
Under turbulent flow conditions, the objective function is expressed as:
(36)
(37)
(38)
This equation enables the model to closely match the data, making it a valuable tool for further analysis and design improvements.
Fig. 24 presents the distribution of errors by comparing the numerical simulation results with the correlation predictions for Nu, f, and JF. The error for Nu fluctuates within ±7 %, indicating that the correlation predicts heat transfer rates with reasonable accuracy. The friction factor f shows a slightly wider error margin of ±10 %, reflecting moderate deviation in flow resistance prediction. Meanwhile, the JF exhibits the smallest error, remaining within ±5 %, demonstrating a high level of agreement between simulation and correlation. The relatively minor errors across all parameters indicate the precision of the fitting process, confirming the correlation model's effectiveness and reliability in representing the complex flow and heat transfer behavior.

6. Conclusions
This study investigated the effects of transverse, longitudinal, and circumferential placements of CRVGs on the flow structures and thermal performance of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. The results clarify the role of CRVG spatial arrangement and provide important insights for high performance circular-tube-fin heat exchangers. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1)
Optimal transverse and longitudinal positioning of CRVGs significantly enhances thermal performance. A transverse offset of Δz = 1 mm yields peak JF and Nu values within 400 < Re < 5000. Compared with plain fins, Nu increases by up to 34.2 %, while JF reaching its maximum value of 1.32 at Re = 1000. Similarly, a longitudinal offset of Δx = 2 mm produces a maximum JF of 1.30 at Re = 1000.
(2)
The optimal circumferential position depends on the Re. For Re ≤ 1000,Δβ = 0° yields the highest JF of 1.29, while for Re = 2000, Δβ = +15° achieves a JF of 1.18, indicating that higher Re shifts the optimal circumferential arrangement.
(3)
Circumferential placement exerts the strongest influence among all spatial configurations. Compared with transverse or longitudinal adjustments, circumferential positioning generates more intense vortices and delivers greater heat transfer enhancement.
(4)
A strong correlation between the Nu and Se is established under both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Nu increases consistently with Se. confirming that secondary flow intensity fundamentally determines heat transfer enhancement, with stronger induced vortices leading to proportionally greater heat transfer.
(5)
Empirical correlations relating Nu, f, and JF to CRVG positional parameters of and Re are developed for both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. These correlations provide practical and reliable tools for the preliminary design, performance evaluation, and optimization of circular-tube-fin heat exchangers equipped with CRVGs.
