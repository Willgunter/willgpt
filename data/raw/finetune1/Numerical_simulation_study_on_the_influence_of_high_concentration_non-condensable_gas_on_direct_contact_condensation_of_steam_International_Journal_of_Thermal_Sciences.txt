Abstract
This paper couples the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model with the Realizable k-ε model and uses self-developed UDF to simulate the direct contact condensation of steam containing non-condensable gas (NCG) in a restricted pipe. It explores the influence of 0–10 % NCG on vapor plume, heat transfer, and thrust performance. The results show that the condensation rate is the highest when it is pure steam, reaching 3291 kg/(m3·s); 6 % NCG causes a sudden drop of the rate by 68.7 %, and the decrease rate slows down further with the increase of NCG. The presence of NCG will elongate the vapor plume, change the radial expansion, and the exit gas fraction increases from 0 to 1. The heat transfer area shrinks to the vicinity of the nozzle, the axial temperature drop decreases and shifts backward; the maximum velocity at the nozzle decreases by approximately 20 m/s, while the high-velocity zone expands. The thrust performance increases first and then stabilizes with NCG, and the increase in specific impulse is due to the enhanced momentum exchange of the vapor bubbles reaching the outlet. The above results shed light on the nonlinear regulation mechanism of the NCG on the performance of the vapor condensate and jet, which can provide a theoretical basis for the optimization design of condensate and jet systems.

1. Introduction
Direct Contact Condensation (DCC), as an efficient means of heat and mass transfer, is widely applied in key equipment such as the safety shell depressurization system of nuclear power plants, steam ejectors, seawater desalination, and chemical condensers. However, during actual operation, system leakage or process requirements often result in the admixture of NCG into the steam, significantly deteriorating the condensation performance. Researchers have long explored the effect of NCG on brane-like or droplet-like condensates, either experimentally or through simplified models [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. However, studies on the three-dimensional transient mechanism of direct contact condensation of steam jets in restricted pipe are still insufficient, especially under conditions of high NCG content (>5 %), where the evolution of vapor plumes, the distribution of interface thermal resistance, and the variation patterns of thrust performance have not yet reached a unified understanding.
Wei et al. [5] employed a VOF-CSF coupled model and incorporated a PID real-time regulation strategy into the Lee phase change model, enabling the simulation results to be synchronized with the experimental correlations, and achieving a high-fidelity numerical recreation of the entire process of air-steam mixed bubble condensation. The influence laws of subcooling degree and initial bubble diameter were systematically studied. The results indicated that increasing the supercooling degree or reducing the bubble size could enhance heat transfer, but the effect was limited by the thickening of the interface air layer. Yi et al. [6] conducted a high-speed camera experiment to study the influence of non-condensable air on the condensation morphology and heat transfer of water vapor on a vertical aluminum plate, with the air quality fraction ranging from 0.05 to 0.5. They observed four condensation modes: droplet, droplet-vein, liquid film, and fine stream. Low concentration air (5–10 %) could significantly reduce the condensation heat transfer coefficient, while high concentration (40–50 %) had a less significant effect. Alshehri et al. [7] proposed a low-consumption and high-precision numerical framework for simulating film condensation with NCG (0–100 %). The model solves for the liquid film and the diffusive layer independently, coupling them through an interface energy balance; The liquid film was solved analytically by Nusselt, and the gas side was solved using a finite volume method to solve the full set of conservation equations, taking into account absorption effects and variable properties. The model does not require empirical coefficients and the full-range predictions are in good agreement with classical results. Zhou et al. [8] employed a 3D steady-state heterogeneous multiphase model to systematically investigate the direct contact condensation of steam jets containing NCG in subcooled water flow within a confined vertical channel. The results indicated that as the air content increased, the steam plume transformed from a compact ellipsoid to a divergent cone, and the penetration length and the maximum radial width simultaneously increased; the radial convergence of the high-speed liquid flow at the plume tip resulted in a significant pressure peak, which weakened with the increase of air content. Ji et al. [9] utilized short-time high-pressure steam jets to actively disrupt the NCG-steam mixture boundary layer, thereby significantly enhancing condensation heat transfer under NCG-containing conditions. Within the NCG mass fraction range of 0.084–0.45, the jet achieves a maximum enhancement ratio of ≥137 %, an average enhancement ratio of ≥118 %, and the more NCG there is, the more obvious the enhancement. The enhancement lasts for 10–15 s and becomes longer as the NCG increases. Zhou et al. [10] constructed a three-dimensional CFD model to study the influence of non-condensable air on the direct condensation of stable steam jets. The model adopts a modified thermal equilibrium phase transition model, introducing an air volume fraction of 0–7 %, and is solved by coupling the mixture multiphase flow with the Realizable k-ε turbulence model. It is shown that the penetration length of the vapor plume extends as the amount of air increases, and that the air accumulates at the tip of the plume and reaches the maximum volume fraction. The decrease in the axial vapor volume fraction slows down, and the rate of change in velocity, pressure, and temperature all decreases. Jahangiri et al. [11] conducted a systematic numerical simulation on the influence of condensing temperature and non-condensing gas (air) on the performance of ejectors in steam power plants. By establishing a two-dimensional axisymmetric compressible wet steam flow model and coupling the non-equilibrium condensation model with the Euler-Euler single-fluid method, the operating characteristics of the high-pressure steam ejector within the condenser temperature range of 320–340 K and the air mass fraction range of 0–0.35 were simulated. The results show that an increase in condensing temperature significantly reduces the ejection efficiency (by 61.16 %) and increases the exergy loss (by 12.13 %), while an increase in air content slightly improves the ejection ratio and efficiency but is accompanied by a further increase in exergy loss. Zhang et al. [12] constructed a two-dimensional boundary layer model and numerically simulated the direct contact condensation heat transfer behavior of steam containing NCG on the falling liquid column of a convergent tube. The results show that increasing the convergence Angle from 0° to 40° can enhance the condensation heat transfer coefficient by 1.06–4.8 times. An increase in the mass fraction of NCG significantly weakens heat exchange, and the local NCG concentration downstream can exceed 90 %. In addition, the condensation length increases with the increase of steam pressure, initial velocity of the liquid column and nozzle diameter, and shortens with the increase of NCG concentration and convergence angle. Jiang et al. [13] constructed and verified the physical-mathematical model of supersonic condensation of a triplet mixture of methane, water vapor and nonane in a Laval nozzle. Simulations show that water vapor first spontaneously condenses to form nuclear droplets, and then acts as heterogeneous nuclei to significantly reduce the condensation energy barrier of nonane, causing it to condense at a lower subcooling degree (38.3 K) and supersaturation degree (37.4 K), thereby accelerating the overall condensation process.
This study employs a three-dimensional numerical simulation to systematically investigate the influence of high-concentration non-condensable gas (NCG, 0–10 %) on the direct contact condensation (DCC) of steam in a restricted pipe. Utilizing the VOF multiphase flow model and the Realizable k-ε turbulence model, complemented by a self-compiled UDF that couples phase change, heat and mass transfer, and NCG partial pressure effects, it provides a comprehensive evaluation of vapor plume morphology, pressure, temperature, velocity, and ejector thrust performance. Unlike existing studies focusing on medium-low NCG concentrations (<5 %) or simplified models, this work reveals a nonlinear transition in both condensation performance and thrust characteristics at approximately 6 % NCG content. The findings offer a crucial theoretical basis for the collaborative optimization of condensers and steam injection systems under high NCG conditions.
2. Model construction
2.1. Geometric model
The geometric model used in this research is shown in Fig. 1. The operation is carried out in the form of central air intake and peripheral water intake. The overall length of the model is 230 mm, and the parameters of each diameter are shown in Table 1. The whole can be divided into two parts: a 60 mm inlet section and a 170 mm mixing section (discharge section). The gas phase enters from the central channel and the liquid phase enters from the circumferential channel. At the inlet section, each phase undergoes single-phase flow. Then, the gas and liquid phases come into contact in the mixing section and undergo condensation phase change. Subsequently, the mixed working medium flows downstream and is discharged.

2.2. Mathematical model
For the content of this study, the multiphase flow model adopts the VOF model, which is a widely used method in multiphase flow simulation to solve the interface problem between liquids and gases or other fluids. It tracks the gas-liquid interface of the flow field by introducing an array representing the volume fraction of the liquid phase into the flow field. The continuity equation, momentum conservation equation, energy conservation equation and VOF model are as follows [14]:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
Where, hph represents the enthalpy value of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and temperature.
As for the turbulence model, this study adopts the Realizable k-ε turbulence model. The turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε are obtained from the following transport equation [15]:
(6)
(7)
Where, Prk, Prε and C2 are empirical constants, taking values of 1.0, 1.2 and 1.9 respectively. Gk is the turbulent kinetic energy generation term caused by the average velocity gradient. The calculation methods of other parameters in the formula are as follows:
(8)
Where, the calculation method of μt is as follows:
(9)
It is worth noting that the Cu that appears in the calculation formula of turbulent viscosity μt is different from the constant taken in the standard k-ε turbulence model. In the Realizable k-ε turbulence model, it is a variable, and the calculation method is as follows:
(10)
Where, the values and calculation methods of each parameter have been detailedly provided. It should be particularly noted that it is the time-averaged rotational rate tensor, which is used to represent the influence of flow rotation. Therefore, when the flow is irrotational, this term takes 0. The values and calculation methods of other parameters in Cu are as follows:
(11)
(12)
Based on Dalton's law of partial pressures, the steam partial pressure pv is calculated as:
(13)
Among them, αNCG represents the volume fraction of NCG, and ptotal represents the total pressure. The saturation temperature Tsat corresponding to the steam partial pressure is obtained through the IAPWS-IF97 steam property formula by solving the pv iteration. The latent heat of condensation is also obtained from the IAPWS-IF97 database based on Tsat.
In order to solve the governing equations, we use the finite volume method Coupled for discretization. This method has high accuracy and stability when dealing with fluid mechanics problems. PRESTO! is used to solve the pressure. The Compressive was used for the volume fraction and the momentum equation and turbulence equation are discreted in the second-order upwind scheme, and the residual convergence standard is 1e-6.
Considering that there is a vigorous phase change process in this study, a UDF was written for the heat and mass transfer process. It is shown in Fig. 2. The whole is composed of three parts, namely the initial setting, the main function and the auxiliary function, among which the main function is composed of two parts. The overall process is as follows: Firstly, User Defined Memory (UDM) is defined in the initial Settings. In this study, 8 UDMs are defined, and their function is to store and transfer important parameters. Secondly, in the calculation of the main function, the first part is the calculation of thermodynamic parameters, including phase volume fraction, pressure, and the content of NCG, etc. Since the presence of NCG will affect the saturation temperature, the vapor partial pressure will be calculated based on Dalton's partial pressure law for the calculation of the saturation temperature. Store these parameters in the corresponding UMD for subsequent calculations. The second part is the calculation of the source term section, including the mass source term and the energy source term. The mass source term is used to reflect the mass transfer during the steam condensation process. Since the steam condenses into water, it is necessary to calculate the liquid phase mass source term and the gas phase mass source term separately. The energy source term is due to the latent heat release during the phase change process, thus requiring energy input to the system. Finally, in order for the main function to run smoothly, some auxiliary functions are also needed for calculation supplementation, including the calculation of dimensionless numbers, the calculation of saturation temperature, and the calculation of enthalpy difference between gas and liquid phases, etc.

2.3. Grid independence verification
The grid division scheme includes aspects such as the type of grid cells, grid spacing, and the division of grid division areas. Generally speaking, the grid quality of structured grids is higher than that of unstructured grids, and under the same precision, the number of grids in structured grids is less than that in unstructured grids. Therefore, structured grid partitioning schemes are widely used in computing scenarios with large amounts of computation and high requirements for computational accuracy. Since this model is a rotational symmetry model and its flow direction is consistent with the direction of gravity, in order to improve the computational efficiency, a 1/4 model is used for numerical simulation, as shown in Fig. 3. The mixing section is locally encrypted because steam condensation mainly occurs in this section and the flow field undergoes drastic changes. To enhance the computational accuracy, grid encryption is applied to this area. The global mesh adopts a polyhedrum-hexahedral mesh, which can smoothly transition at the sudden changes in the cross-section of the fluid domain and improve the computational stability.

Fig. 3. Grid division.

In this study, three different quantities were used for grid independence verification. The three grid division schemes are shown in Table 2. The radial velocity distribution at a distance of 90 mm from the entrance section was compared. The numerical simulation results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the radial velocity under the mesh1 method differs significantly from that of mesh2 and mesh3, while the radial velocities of the mesh2 and mesh3 methods are basically the same. However, the more meshes there are, the lower the calculation efficiency. Therefore, the mesh2 scheme is selected for the subsequent numerical simulation.

2.4. Model verification
To verify the reliability of the mathematical model, by comparing it with the temperature data of the pipeline axis in Ref. [16], the results are shown in Fig. 5. Although there are deviations between the simulation results and the experimental data during the rapid temperature drop stage, this might be due to local fluctuations in the experimental measurements and the simplifications made in the numerical simulation regarding extreme turbulence and transient phase change interfaces. However, the overall temperature distribution trend and key features, such as the maintenance of the high-temperature zone, the position of the rapid condensation zone, and the final temperature convergence value, are highly consistent. To present the measurement uncertainty more intuitively, we have added error bars to the experimental data in Fig. 5. The numerical results show excellent agreement with the experimental trends and largely fall within the experimental error bounds, indicating that the established model reliably reproduces the main physical processes of steam DCC.

3.1. Influence of NCG content on vapor plumes
The effect of the NCG content on the vapor plume is shown in Fig. 6. After the ejection of the gas phase from the central passage, the vapor plume will remain stable for a certain length of time and then exhibit a pattern of first expanding and then contracting. It can be clearly observed that when NCG is present, the length of the vapor plume significantly increases, the contraction trend gradually slows down, and a significant flattening section appears. At the same time, under conditions of medium to high content of NCG, the vapor plume can reach the outlet position, and the width of the vapor plume also gradually increases.

Fig. 6. Comparison of vapor plume shape and length.

The distribution results of the radial gas phase volume fraction at the outlet plane from the center to the pipe wall are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen from the figure, the distribution pattern of the radial gas phase volume fraction at the outlet shows obvious phased characteristics with the change of NCG content, which can be divided into three stages: "Not reaching the outlet", "just reaching the outlet" and "complete expansion". When the content of NCG is 0 %, the vapor plume cannot reach the outlet position, indicating that the gas and liquid phases have reached thermal equilibrium in the tube. Therefore, the shape of the vapor plume is stable and it is in the stage of not reaching the outlet. When the content of NCG is 1 %, the length of the vapor plume increases significantly, and the gas volume fraction at the outlet gradually decreases from 0.65 to 0. When the content of NCG is 6 % or less, the volume fraction of the gas phase gradually decreases from the maximum value of 1 to 0, and as the content of NCG increases, the maximum value gradually increases, indicating that the vapor plume gradually grows to the outlet, which can be considered as just reaching the outlet stage. When the content of NCG exceeds 6 %, the gas volume fraction at the outlet reaches 1, indicating that the vapor plume has fully reached the outlet. As the content of NCG increases, the vapor plume continues to expand, and the range where the gas volume fraction at the outlet is 1 keeps expanding. It reaches its maximum when the content of NCG is 10 %, which is the complete expansion stage. In addition, it can be observed that when the content of NCG does not exceed 6 %, the change in the vapor plume is relatively obvious. However, when the content of NCG exceeds 6 %, the radial change of the vapor plume along the pipeline is not significant.

The variation results of mass transfer rate under different levels of NCG content are shown in Fig. 8. The presence of a distinct and complete continuum mass transfer interface at the gas-liquid interface when the NCG content is 0 per cent indicates that vapor condensation occurs entirely at the gas-liquid interface. Subsequently, as the NCG content increases, mass transfer occurs only near the exit of the central channel. Moreover, as the amount of NCG increases, the mass transfer rate gradually decreases and the condensation range also decreases.

Fig. 8. Distribution result of mass transfer rate.

The comparison results of the maximum mass transfer rates under various conditions are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen from the figure that when there is no NCG, the condensation rate of steam is the maximum, with the maximum value being 3291kg/(m3·s), indicating that steam condensation is a very intense process. When the content of NCG gradually increases to 6 %, the steam condensation rate decreases to 1029kg/(m3·s), which is 68.73 % lower than that of pure steam. When the content of NCG is 10 %, the maximum condensation rate is 889.5kg/(m3·s), which is 13.56 % lower than that of 6 % NCG. The change results are consistent with the changes in the curve in Fig. 7. Both show significant changes when the content of NCG does not reach 6 %. When the content of NCG exceeds 6 %, with the increase of NCG, the condensation rate no longer shows obvious changes. The reason is that when the NCG content reaches approximately 6 %, the front end of the vapor plume has extended to the pipeline outlet, causing a significant accumulation of NCG at the tail of the plume. NCG forms a high-concentration gas diffusion layer at the gas-liquid interface, which significantly increases the interface thermal resistance and reduces the steam partial pressure, thereby weakening the driving force for condensation (i.e., the steam saturation temperature at the interface decreases). This "gas coverage layer" effect reaches a critical state when the NCG content is approximately 6 %, resulting in a sudden and abrupt decrease in the condensation rate (a 68.7 % decrease). When the NCG content further increases (>6 %), the interface NCG layer has become saturated, and the enhancement effect of its hindrance on condensation slows down, thus the trend of the decline in the condensation rate also slows down.

3.2. Influence of NCG content on pressure distribution
The influence of NCG on the pressure changes during the steam condensation process in the pipeline is shown in Fig. 10. We selected the minimum pressure value reached first within the fluctuation cycle at a distance of 60 mm from the center of the inlet as the unified state standard. It can be observed that the vapor, issued at high pressure from the central nozzle, undergoes condensation upon contact with the subcooled water, causing the lowest pressure to occur at the nozzle exit. In the absence of NCG, the sub-cooled water interacts fully with the steam, leading to an intense condensation at the liquid–vapor interface and a pronounced pressure variation there. As the NCG fraction increases, mass transfer is progressively impaired, which attenuates the intensity of interfacial steam condensation. Furthermore, the accumulation of NCG toward the tail of the vapor plume confines the significant pressure change to the initial gas–liquid contact region, whereas downstream pressure remains almost unaltered.

Fig. 10. Pressure distribution.

The pressure distribution at the center of the pipe under various operating conditions is shown in Fig. 11. The gas enters at high pressure from the central inlet. At the outlet of the central channel, condensation occurs due to contact with subcooled water, causing a sharp drop in pressure. Subsequently, the downstream pressure tends to stabilize as the condensation process stabilizes and the condensation of the NCG deteriorates the condensation of the vapor. At the same time, as the amount of NCG increases, the pressure at the gas-phase entrance gradually decreases, while the pressure at the exit of the central channel shows the opposite trend. As the amount of NCG increases, the minimum pressure value increases, that is, the pressure difference from the entrance to the exit of the central channel decreases as the amount of NCG increases. This again demonstrates the obstructive effect of the NCG on the condensation of the vapor, reducing the strength of the condensation.

3.3. Influence of NCG content on temperature distribution
The temperature results are shown in Fig. 12. Its shape is similar to that of the corresponding vapor plume. The high-temperature gas phase enters from the central entrance. At the exit of the central passage, the temperature drops slightly. After being ejected from the central passage, it comes into contact with the surrounding subcooled water, causing a rapid drop in temperature. However, the presence of NCG leads to the growth of vapor plumes and hinders the gas-liquid heat transfer process. The heat transfer at the end of the vapor plume is reduced so that the hot gas can continue to reach the downstream part of the pipeline. As the vapor plume grows, the gas-liquid heat-exchange region increases and thus the temperature eventually decreases. Namely, in Fig., the hot fluid continues to flow downstream as the NCG content increases, but the degree of temperature reduction gradually increases as well.

Fig. 12. Temperature distribution.

The effect of the NCG on the temperature profile is shown in Fig. 13. The gas phase enters the pipe at the same inlet temperature and is ejected at the exit of the central channel, coming into contact with subcooled water. The temperature drops rapidly and the temperature difference is largest in the absence of NCG. However, as the NCG content increases, the temperature difference gradually decreases. Subsequently, as the plume expands, hot gas is continuously replenished into the space formed by the plume, causing the temperature to rise. However, the condensation effect of subcooled water on the vapor plume is still present at this time. Thus, the temperature rise is lower in the case of 0 %NCG than in the case of working conditions where the NCG hinders heat transfer. Finally, as the gas-liquid interface increases, the temperature first drops to the subcooled water temperature around 130 mm in the case of pure vapor, as shown in Fig. 13. However, in the presence of NCG, as the content of NCG increases, the process by which the temperature of each working condition drops to the subcooled water temperature gradually slows down, from 175 mm under the condition of 1 %NCG to 230 mm under the condition of 6 %NCG. Meanwhile, it can be observed that when the content of NCG is between 7 % and 10 %, the temperature curves are very close, indicating that at this point, the hindrance of NCG on the condensation phenomenon is the greatest and is no longer significantly affected by the content of NCG.

3.4. Influence of NCG content on velocity distribution
As shown in Fig. 14 of the velocity field results, the gas phase enters from the entrance of the central channel, is accelerated through the contracting channel, and is finally ejected at a high velocity. From the point of view of the velocity influence range, the velocity influence range gradually increases as the NCG increases. The reason for this is that the flow resistance inside the vapor plume is smaller than outside it. Therefore, as the vapor plume increases, its internal space also increases, and the flow resistance decreases. This enables high-velocity flow to reach downstream more easily, that is, it increases the range of velocity influence.

Fig. 14. Velocity distribution.

The effect of the NCG on the velocity is shown in Fig. 15. The results indicate that the maximum velocity occurs at the position after the exit of the central channel. And as the content of NCG increases, the maximum velocity gradually decreases, from 490 m/s to 470 m/s, as shown in Fig. 15(b). The reason for the reduced velocity is that the mixing of the NCG with the vapor changes the density of the mixed gas, which affects the acceleration capacity of the fluid. Because the density of NCG is different from that of steam, the density of the mixed gas increases, and the increase in density will lead to a decrease in the fluid's acceleration ability. Meanwhile, the NCG will disperse the energy of the steam because the kinetic energy of the steam is not only used to accelerate the pumped fluid but also partially to accelerate the NCG. However, due to the thermodynamic properties of the NCG being different from those of the steam, it cannot be accelerated as efficiently as the steam, thus preventing the pumped fluid from obtaining sufficient energy to reach a higher velocity. In addition, NCG can also form turbulence or vortices, increasing the resistance of the fluid, consuming some kinetic energy, and reducing the acceleration efficiency of the fluid. Moreover, NCG does not release latent heat through phase change like steam, further reducing energy utilization efficiency. These factors work together, ultimately leading to a reduction in the maximum velocity of the ejector. However, after 150 mm from the inlet position, the velocity of all working conditions is basically the same, indicating that the NCG also has a certain influence on the steam ejection velocity, but mainly lies in the position where the steam is ejected from the central channel.

3.5. Influence of NCG content on thrust performance
In this study, specific impulse is used to characterize the thrust performance, which mainly consists of two parts: the momentum thrust and the pressure thrust ejected from the nozzle outlet. The calculation method is as follows:
(14)
Where, Isp represents specific impulse, Ns/kg; 
 is the air mass flow rate, kg/s; ve represents the nozzle velocity in m/s, and Pe and Pa represent the outlet pressure and ambient pressure in respectively in Pa. Ae represents the cross-sectional area of the nozzle outlet in m2.
The thrust performance is shown in Fig. 16. As the content of NCG increases, the thrust performance gradually improves. When the content of NCG is 10 %, the thrust performance reaches its maximum. The rate of change of specific impulse is shown by the curve in the figure. When there is no NCG, the thrust performance of the injector is the worst. After adding NCG, the thrust increases significantly, and when the NCG increases to 6 %, the thrust performance also increases significantly. When the content of NCG exceeds 6 %, the improvement of its thrust performance is limited. The reason lies in the fact that the presence of NCG makes it easier for high-velocity gas to reach the ejector outlet surface. Through momentum transfer, the liquid at the outlet has a greater velocity, thus enhancing the thrust performance. Based on the above analysis, when the content of NCG is 6 %, the vapor plume reaches the critical position (at the outlet interface). When the content of NCG exceeds 6 %, the vapor plume completely expands, and the outlet interface of the injector is basically filled with the gas phase, with very little liquid phase content. Therefore, the momentum will not increase significantly, resulting in a decrease in the growth rate of thrust.

Fig. 16. Comparison of thrust performance.

This discovery holds significant guiding significance for the design of steam ejectors. During actual operation, if NCG inevitably exists in the system, such as due to air leakage, it can be considered to keep its content within approximately 6 % to take advantage of its gain effect on thrust performance while avoiding excessive deterioration of condensation efficiency. For scenarios that require high thrust but have less stringent condensation requirements, such as certain propulsion or mixing systems, even an appropriate amount of NCG can be intentionally introduced as a performance adjustment measure.
4. Conclusion
This study numerically investigated the influence of high-concentration NCG on the direct contact condensation of steam in a confined pipeline. The main conclusions are as follows:
The influence on vapor plume and condensation rate. The presence of NCG significantly alters the shape of the vapor plume, making it elongated and expanded. The condensation rate is highest in pure vapor, at 3291 kg/(m3·s). When the NCG content increases to 6 %, the condensation rate drops by 68.7 %, and further increasing NCG leads to a slower rate decline. This indicates that medium and low concentrations of NCG have the most significant inhibitory effect on condensation.
The influence on thermal and flow parameters. NCG hinders gas-liquid heat transfer, causing the axial temperature drop to slow down and the high-temperature zone to shift downward. The pressure distribution shows that NCG weakens the interface condensation strength, raising the minimum pressure value. In the velocity field, NCG reduces the maximum velocity at the nozzle outlet from 490 m/s to 470 m/s, but the high-velocity zone increases due to the expansion of the vapor plume.
The influence on thrust performance. Appropriate NCG (≤6 %) can increase the impeller specific impulse, as the gas phase can more easily reach the outlet and enhance thrust through momentum exchange. Beyond 6 %, the thrust gain tends to saturate.
This study reveals the nonlinear regulatory mechanism of steam condensation and flow under high NCG concentrations, providing an important theoretical basis for the design and performance optimization of condensers and ejector systems with non-condensable gases.
