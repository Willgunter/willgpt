Abstract
The horizontal-axis tidal turbine operates in a complex marine environment with challenging loading conditions and maintenance requirements. Fatigue life analysis is essential for optimizing turbine maintenance schedules and ensuring operational reliability and longevity. This study investigates strength and crack propagation in tidal energy turbine blades using XFEM and the Walker equation, analyzing various crack positions. A 3D finite element model incorporating TSR (
) reveals that blade static stress and displacement exhibit proportional increases with TSR. The maximum static stress (0.60 MPa) concentrates at the blade-root/hub interface, while peak displacement (0.76 mm) occurs at the blade tip. Fatigue analysis using Case II demonstrates crack-length gradients dependent on the crack ratio (a/b), with the maximum extension reaching 9.8 mm at position 1. A critical crack ratio threshold of 0.05 is identified through fatigue threshold analysis, providing a critical threshold for blade durability assessment.

1. Introduction
The global drive toward carbon neutrality has intensified renewable energy development, with tidal energy standing out as a high-potential solution due to its superior grid compatibility and predictable output compared to intermittent solar/wind sources (Yang et al., 2023; Khojasteh et al., 2023). This energy originates from gravitational interactions within the Earth-Moon-Sun system, offering sustainable power generation with 90 % lower aquatic ecological impact than conventional hydropower (Ma et al., 2023). Tidal energy has a projected global capacity of 120 GW and could produce up to 150TWh per annum (Abuan and Howell, 2019). In China, the overall tidal current resource reserves are about 13.96 GW, 78.6 % of which is distributed in the 95 channels in the East China Sea (Liu et al., 2021).
As critical energy converters, HATTs confront critical operational challenges: blades endure cyclic hydrodynamic loading, cavitation-induced surface degradation, vortex-induced vibrations, and harmonic stresses from turbulent flow fields (Shi et al., 2016; Hadzic et al., 2014; Jo et al., 2012). These multi-physics interactions accelerate fatigue damage accumulation, ultimately governing turbine reliability (typically <20 years), operational safety, and lifecycle costs.
Tidal energy turbines demonstrate significant structural and operational parallels with wind turbines, particularly in their blade architecture and energy conversion mechanisms. Both systems employ aerodynamically optimized blades to transform kinetic energy (tidal currents/wind flow) into mechanical rotation, as extensively documented in comparative studies (Zaidi et al., 2021; Ahmed, 2013). This functional isomorphism establishes a vital knowledge bridge, enabling the adaptation of wind turbine fatigue research methodologies to tidal energy applications (Jo et al., 2017). Contemporary advances in wind energy technology, particularly in blade optimization algorithms (Liu et al., 2024) and operational stability enhancement (Vennell et al., 2015; Druault and Krawczynski, 2023), provide essential theoretical frameworks for analyzing tidal turbine blade integrity.
Shakya (Shakya et al., 2024) analyzed the blade life of two different types of small wind turbines by establishing a finite element model as a load boundary condition to predict turbine performance and reliability, thereby predicting the blade life. Hua et al. (2025) analyzed the response of a semi-submersible offshore wind turbine with an assorbing wave energy converter (WEC) following the failure of a single mooring line (ML), the results show that fatigue is more likely to occur in the platform in both rated and extreme conditions. Jiao (2021) further investigated the dynamic response of wind turbine blades, analyzing the extension length and depth of fatigue cracks and pinpointing the root of the blade as the most vulnerable position. Further advancing this field, Li et al. (2023) demonstrated through three-dimensional finite element modeling that non-Gaussian wind field characteristics exert a predominant influence on crack initiation phases in offshore wind turbine blades, while exhibiting negligible effects on propagation stages.
Building on these foundations, tidal energy research has developed specialized fatigue assessment protocols. Finnegan et al. (2022) developed a full-scale fibre-reinforced composite blade for use on 1 MW power generating nacelles of a tidal turbine and improved its equivalent design life. Zhang et al. (2018) identified critical stress concentration zones in 20 kW floating tidal turbines using strain energy density mapping. Gonabadi et al. (2022) proposed a fatigue life prediction framework for composite tidal turbine blades, their research found that fatigue failures, particularly delamination, tend to occur at the blade root. Harper and Hallett (2015) employed advanced numerical modeling techniques to study interfacial crack growth in composite tidal turbine blades, assessing the influence of manufacturing defects and material stacking sequences on crack propagation. These methodological innovations collectively address the unique hydrodynamic challenges in tidal environments, including harmonic loading from turbulent flow fields and cavitation-induced surface degradation.
The prevalent numerical methods for crack analysis primarily include the Finite Element Method (FEM) (Sari and Zergoug, 2015), the Generalized/Extended Finite Element Method (G/XFEM) (Duarte et al., 2000; Menouillard et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011), the Boundary Element Method (BEM) (Yan, 2010), and the Numerical Manifold Method (NMM) (Yang et al., 2020). Among these, XFEM has emerged as a preeminent computational tool for fracture mechanics analysis, particularly in resolving crack propagation challenges within geometrically complex structures. Pioneered by Belytschko et al. (Belytschko and Black, 1999; Moës et al., 1999), XFEM offers three salient advantages: (1) Independence of crack geometry from the underlying mesh discretization; (2) Elimination of the need for remeshing during crack growth; and (3) Capability to achieve high numerical accuracy on relatively coarse meshes. Owing to these significant advantages, XFEM effectively predicts mechanical behaviors such as crack initiation and propagation in industrial components characterized by complex fracture geometries (Karihaloo and Xiao, 2003; Abdelaziz and Hamouine, 2008; Menouillard and Belytschko, 2010). Chen et al. (2023) applied XFEM to study fatigue crack propagation in vertical centrifugal pump runners, revealing a quantitative relationship between crack length and fatigue life. Hassen et al., 2023, 2025 developed a FRANC3D-ABAQUS co-simulation framework to quantify crack evolution in axial-flow turbomachinery under multi-physics loading (centrifugal, aerodynamic, and combined stresses), identifying blade-root junctions as critical failure initiators.
However, fundamental gaps persist in tidal energy applications, particularly concerning hydrodynamic load-crack interaction mechanisms and probabilistic durability assessment. This study bridges these knowledge gaps through a multi-physics coupling framework integrating XFEM with the Walker equation and Monte Carlo simulation, specifically designed for HATTs. The proposed methodology employs a multi-physics computational framework to comprehensively investigate fracture mechanics behavior through three interlinked dimensions: crack trajectory sensitivity to initial defect topology (including surface/subsurface configurations), crack length evolution under multi-axial loading spectra, and probabilistic determination of threshold crack ratios (a/b) via advanced failure assessment diagrams integrating material heterogeneity and hydrodynamic load stochasticity.
The derived fatigue cracking threshold establishes an operational safety criterion for tidal turbines, while the validated simulation framework provides a predictive tool for maintenance scheduling and reliability enhancement in marine energy systems.
2. Hydraulic analysis of tidal energy turbine
2.1. Fluid numerical model
State-of-the-art tidal energy turbines are predominantly deployed in marine environments with water depths of 30–50 m and current velocities spanning 0.5–3 m/s (Chen et al., 2020). To ensure dynamic similitude in scaled testing, hydraulic similarity principles mandate conservation of the Fr between prototype and model turbines. The dimensionless Fr, governing fluid inertia-gravity force relationships, is defined as,
(1)
where g represents gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s2), l the characteristic length scale (water depth, m). The subscript p denotes the original model, while the subscript m refers to the test model. The scaling criterion preserves surface wave effects and turbulent flow characteristics critical for hydrodynamic performance validation.
The investigation employs a HATT prototype within a full-scale hydrodynamic domain comprising an 11.8 m (L) × 1.2 m (W) × 0.6 m (H) flow channel. To ensure the complete development of turbulence, the turbine is positioned 2.8 m downstream from the inlet boundary with 0.3 m vertical clearance from channel bed to blade tip (Fig. 1), allowing full turbulence development. Blade geometry optimization via Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory yields critical design parameters cataloged in Table 1.

According to Eq. (1), the simulated flow velocity range (0.11–0.42 m/s) corresponds to prototype-scale conditions (Fr ≈ 0.16). A representative testing velocity of 0.4 m/s is selected, achieving Re similarity (Re ≈ 1.19 × 105) essential for boundary layer dynamics preservation in scaled experiments (Alipour, 2020).
2.2. Working condition
The TSR (
) critically governs tidal turbine efficiency through its nonlinear relationship with hydrodynamic energy extraction (Wang et al., 2022; Song et al., 2020). Sub-optimal TSR conditions induce dual failure modes: at low TSR (λ < 2.8), inadequate blade angular velocity (ω) causes flow energy under utilization (<30 % theoretical maximum), while excessive TSR (λ > 6.0) triggers flow separation and cavitation inception (vapor volume fraction >15 %) that degrade efficiency by 20–40 % (Sun et al., 2022; Lan et al., 2021). Zhang (Zhang et al., 2020) conducted a tidal energy turbine model test and quantified T and n under different conditions of TSR, enabling Cp calculation via 
. From the ideal model of Betz' Law, the energy of the water flow 
, 
 is the flow velocity of the water flow in front of the runner, 
 is the flow velocity of the water flow behind the runner, and the efficiency of tidal current energy hydraulic turbine is 
. Experimental validation (Fig. 2) reveals a distinct efficiency maximum in the TSR range of 3.0–4.5, with peak Cp reaching 0.35 at λ = 3.9. The experimental data align within 5 % error margins with BEM-optimized predictions across the tested TSR spectrum (1.6–6.1), establishing robust validation of variable-speed control strategies for irregular tidal regimes.

Three critical TSR (
 = 3.64, 3.90, and 4.32) were systematically investigated through computational simulations to elucidate fatigue crack propagation dynamics and damage evolution mechanisms in tidal turbine blades under variable operational regimes. These TSR values, defined by the dimensionless relationship 
, were strategically selected to span the turbine's peak efficiency range identified in prior experimental validation. The parametric selection captures transitional states between optimal energy extraction (λ = 3.90) and sub-optimal boundary layer conditions (λ = 3.64, 4.32), with comprehensive parametric specifications for each case detailed in Table 2.

2.3. Numerical method
The hydrodynamic analysis adopts the following fundamental assumptions: (1) seawater as a continuous incompressible Newtonian fluid; (2) isothermal flow conditions neglecting heat transfer; (3) time-averaged turbulence characteristics. The governing equations comprise:
Continuity equation:
(2)
Momentum conservation (RANS equations):
(3)
The governing equations employ tensor notation where the displacement vector x (m) and velocity vector u (m/s) are resolved into Cartesian components 
, 
 (m) and 
, 
 (m/s) respectively, denoting orthogonal coordinate directions. The fluid properties are characterized by density 
 (kg/m3), static pressure p (Pa), dynamic viscosity 
 (Pa·s), and turbulent viscosity 
 (Pa·s) derived from the SST k-ω closure model.
A high-fidelity transient structural analysis was implemented to characterize the cyclic loading spectrum acting on turbine blades during operational cycles. Ten monitoring points (CH1-CH10) are strategically positioned on the leading surface of a specific blade, spanning critical regions from leading edge to mid-chord and root transition zone, as detailed in Fig. 3. The data acquisition system was configured to capture pressure signals at 60 Hz sampling frequency.

2.4. Boundary conditions
The hydrodynamic simulations were conducted using ANSYS Fluent 2020 R1 with the following boundary condition configurations: a velocity inlet (0.4 m/s, turbulence intensity 20 % based on in-situ measurements) simulating tidal inflow, a pressure outlet (atmospheric reference with zero gauge pressure and backflow turbulence viscosity ratio capped at 20 %), and a symmetry plane enforcing zero normal velocity gradients at the domain top. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) K-ω model, introduced by Menter (1994), is a two-equation eddy-viscosity turbulence model. It effectively integrates the strengths of both the 
‐
 and k-ω turbulence models and accounts for the influence of turbulent shear stress on the eddy-viscosity term. Consequently, the SST K-ω model has been extensively employed for simulating flows around turbomachinery components (Salunkhe et al., 2019; Sufian et al., 2017; Alipour et al., 2020). Adiabatic no-slip wall boundary conditions, enhanced by wall functions, were applied to all solid surfaces, while the channel bottom incorporated a 0.01 m equivalent sand-grain roughness to replicate seabed effects. The numerical solution employs the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling, with convective terms discretized using a Second Order Upwind scheme for momentum, turbulence, and energy equations. A sliding grid technique governs the transient motion of the rotational domain, while the GGI ensures conservative flux transfer between rotating and stationary domains.
2.5. Fluid numerical meshing
The fluid domain was discretized using a high-fidelity meshing framework (ANSYS ICEM, 2022) employing hybrid tetrahedral/polyhedral elements. Localized mesh refinement was implemented at the rotor-stater interface, maintaining uniform grid spacing across both fluid domains to achieve solution convergence. To ensure grid independence, a systematic mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted through the GCI method, demonstrating less than 2 % variation in CP and CT between successive mesh refinements. The validated numerical framework (Section 2.2 Working Condition, Section 2.4 Boundary Conditions) was subsequently applied to quantify energy conversion efficiency and hydrodynamic loading through two critical dimensionless parameters:
(4)
(5)
Grid convergence analysis (Fig. 4) demonstrated stabilized variations in CP and CT within 1.2 % when mesh count exceeded one million, confirming insufficient accuracy (<5 % deviation from experimental benchmarks) with coarser grids. The optimized computational configuration ultimately adopted 1,118628 elements and 1146936 nodes, strategically balancing precision and efficiency: a hexahedron-dominant mesh in the external flow field and a refined tetrahedral/hexahedron hybrid mesh in the rotating domain. Due to the variation in twist angle along the span of the hydroturbine blade, tetrahedral meshing offers superior capability for capturing the geometric complexity. Consequently, the hydroturbine blades were discretized using tetrahedral elements, with local mesh refinement applied at the blade tip and trailing edge, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The near-wall mesh resolution was designed to achieve a target Y+≈1.4 (
),where 
 is the friction velocity and 
 is the kinematic viscosity. This was accomplished by setting the height of the first grid layer adjacent to the wall (y) to 0.02 mm, with a total of 12 boundary layer grid layers (Moshfeghi et al., 2012; Alipour et al., 2022, 2025). The final validated mesh topology in Fig. 5 (b) features average controlled skewness is 0.041 and average aspect ratio is 1.22 metrics, ensuring robust resolution of vortex-induced stress oscillations critical for crack propagation analysis.

2.6. Fluid numerical results
2.6.1. Static hydraulic pressure
Initial steady-state hydrodynamic analysis reveals distinct pressure differentials across turbine blade surfaces at 100 rpm operational speed (Fig. 6). The pressure-side (advancing surface) demonstrates systematically higher static pressure distributions (82.24 Pa) compared to the suction-side (retreating surface, −291.60 Pa), generating critical axial loading through a mean pressure gradient of 62.48 kPa/m along blade span. Maximum hydrodynamic pressure (1091 Pa) localizes at the leading edge of the blade near the tip, while the minimum pressure (−1554 Pa) emerges at the trailing edge due to adverse pressure gradients and turbulent wake separation. This pressure bimodality drives the blade bending moment and shear force that dominate the fatigue initiation mechanism.

2.6.2. Transient analysis results
Transient hydrodynamic analysis was performed to characterize pressure pulsation spectra for fatigue load characterization, with Fig. 7 illustrating the time-resolved pressure fluctuations at monitoring points under 100 rpm operation. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that spectral analysis revealed CH3 (positioned at middle region of thin edge of blade) exhibits peak pressure pulsation amplitude of 0.157 kPa, 84.70 % higher than adjacent monitoring points. The CH3 pressure-time history (Fig. 8) was consequently selected as the fatigue driving load spectrum. The loading cycle is defined as three complete revolutions of the turbine runner, with the cycle period 
, where f is the rotational frequency (Hz). As shown in the accompanying diagram, the pressure load period acting on the blade pressure surface under this configuration is 
. For a turbine speed of 
, the calculated rotational period per revolution equals 
. This confirms that the hydrodynamic pressure application period aligns precisely with the blade rotational periodicity under the specified operating conditions.

3. Fatigue crack prediction model
3.1. Structural model and material property
The tidal turbine structural assembly comprises three aerodynamically optimized blades, a central hub, and a cylindrical support shaft. Key geometric parameters include a 300 mm rotor diameter with blades featuring a 125 mm chord length, tapering from 50 mm maximum width at 30 % span to 23 mm minimum at the trailing edge. Critical interface dimensions consist of a 16 mm blade-root connection width and 50 mm hub diameter. The structural integrity is ensured by a 160 mm long support shaft with 16 mm diameter, providing axial stiffness.
Blade geometry employs the NREL-S822 low-Reynolds-number airfoil profile, optimized for hydrodynamic performance in transitional flow regimes. The tidal energy turbine is fabricated from 6061 aluminum alloy, and the mechanical properties are listed in Table 3. The complete structural configuration is illustrated in Fig. 9.

Statistical analysis of fatigue crack initiation sites and propagation paths in wind turbine blades reveals that the trailing edge regions are particularly susceptible to fatigue damage (Wang and Zhang, 2017). Accordingly, the fatigue crack propagation analysis employed 16 distinct initial defect configurations to systematically characterize crack dynamics, including trajectory patterns and growth rates. Four circumferential positions were selected along the blade trailing edge (Position 1–4 in Fig. 10), each evaluated with four normalized crack length ratios (a/b = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20). These configurations enabled parametric evaluation of crack path dependency on both geometric position (x/L = 0.2, 0.36, 0.52, 0.68, where L is blade length of 125 mm) and normalized defect severity (a/b), with corresponding absolute crack lengths (1.4–9.0 mm range) cataloged in Table 4.

3.2. XFEM meshing and boundary condition
A unidirectional FSI methodology was implemented to validate structural mesh independence for Case II through a systematic parametric study. Mesh convergence was rigorously assessed by monitoring key structural response parameters (Maximum displacement, stress) across successive refinements, with final results tabulated in Table 5. The validated computational model employed a globally refined mesh configuration with 0.001 m element size to ensure solution accuracy.

The extended finite element (XFEM) computational domain, as depicted in Fig. 11, employs a hybrid meshing strategy to optimize crack propagation analysis. Tetrahedral C3D10 elements (10-node quadratic tetrahedrons) discretize the blade-root and hub regions, providing geometric conformity for stress concentration zones. The crack observation region utilizes structured C3D8R hexahedron elements (8-node reduced integration), capitalizing on the inherent capability of XFEM to model arbitrary crack paths without predefined mesh alignment. Critical zones undergo localized refinement achieving 0.001 m element size at blade/hub interfaces versus 0.002 m in the support shaft, generating 433,523 elements while maintaining strict quality controls. This multi-resolution approach balances computational efficiency with crack-tip stress intensity factor resolution accuracy.

The structural mechanics framework accounts for gravitational, centrifugal, and hydrodynamic pressure loads, where fluid-induced pressures are mapped via one-way FSI. A fixed constraint was imposed on the support shaft base (UX=UY=UZ = 0) to eliminate rigid-body motion in axial, radial, and tangential directions. Tie constraints with 0.02 mm contact tolerance were implemented between the rotor-hub interface and support shaft surface using a surface-to-surface discretization method. The structural model was subjected to 2 × 104 fatigue load cycles, equivalent to 10 h of continuous operation at the rated n = 100 rpm, ensuring statistical significance for crack propagation analysis. Boundary condition implementation, including MPC algorithms for load transfer, is schematically detailed in Fig. 12.

3.3. Fluid-structure interaction theory
Within the FSI framework, hydrodynamic pressure loads derived from ANSYS Fluent CFD simulations were mapped onto the blade surfaces via a conservative interpolation scheme. A nearest-neighbor algorithm was implemented for data transfer between non-conformal meshes, where the fluid domain (source mesh) and structural domain (target mesh) interact. Each structural node queries its nearest fluid counterpart within a normalized search radius, followed by bilinear interpolation of pressure values using shape functions. An overview of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 13. The mapping protocol ensures energy consistency while accommodating mesh density disparities inherent in partitioned coupling strategies.

3.4. Fatigue crack propagation model
The fatigue crack propagation analysis leverages the XFEM to simulate crack initiation and growth with inherent mesh-independence, eliminating the need for explicit crack path meshing. Based on FSI theory, hydrodynamic loads during operation serves as the fatigue loading. Considering the effect of the loading ratio, the Walker equation governs crack growth kinetics to determine the FCGR. The complete computational workflow, encompassing hydrodynamic load mapping, crack evolution, and failure prediction, is systematically illustrated in Fig. 14.

4. Fatigue crack propagation analysis results
4.1. Strength analysis of the blade
The aforementioned XFEM fatigue crack propagation model, incorporating the Walker equation, is developed using ABAQUS. The static stress distribution and total deformation of the blades under 3 operating conditions are illustrated in Fig. 16, Fig. 17. As can be seen from Fig. 16, the observation of a single impeller reveals that the highest stress concentrations occur at the blade-hub connection. This is because the blade root acts as a fixed end, with the blade functioning as a cantilever beam subjected to water flow. The maximum bending moment and shear force are concentrated near the blade root, resulting in the maximum stress value of 0.60 MPa. Across all operating conditions, the stress distribution trend for the three blades shows maximum stress at the blade root, decreasing elliptically toward the tip. However, slight variations in the maximum stress distribution and its affected range at the root are attributed to alternating cyclic stress. As shown in Fig. 17 the displacement cloud illustrates that the blade displacement gradually increases along the axial direction from the root to the tip. The maximum displacement, reaching 0.76 mm, occurs at the blade tip.

Table 7 presents the maximum stress and displacement values of the blade under different operating conditions. The results indicate that both the maximum static stress and maximum displacement increase with higher rotational speeds. This trend is attributed to the increase in pressure on the FSI surface as the TSR (
) rises. For the blade strength assessment, the safety factor for 6061Al is taken as nb = 2.0, with the tensile yield strength of the material being σs = 55.2 MPa. The permissible stress is calculated as [σ] = σs/nb = 27.6 MPa. It can be observed that the maximal static stress of the blade is significantly lower than the yield strength under all operating conditions, indicating that the blade meets the strength requirements in most operating scenarios. However, under the combined effects of the static stress, residual stress, and dynamic stress, the thin edge of the blade exhibits insufficient stiffness and strength. To evaluate the fatigue damage induced by the long-term alternating load on the blade, the fatigue crack propagation behavior of the blade thin edge is analyzed in the subsequent section, using Case II (n = 100 r/min) as a case study.

4.2. Fatigue crack propagation morphology
Taking into account the combined effects of FSI and hydraulic pressure pulsation characteristics, a detailed fatigue crack propagation simulation of the tidal energy turbine blade is performed with the aforementioned fatigue crack propagation model. The simulation considers four different crack positions and initial crack lengths to investigate the impact on the fatigue behavior of the tidal energy turbine blade. Fig. 18, Fig. 19, Fig. 20, Fig. 21 illustrate the fatigue crack propagation morphology of the hydraulic turbine blade under a rotational speed of 100 r/min, considering different initial crack lengths and crack positions. Enlarged images of the initial crack extension path at four different positions with the different crack ratios are shown in the figure below. By observing the crack propagation patterns under different crack ratios, it can be seen that from Fig. 18, Fig. 19, Fig. 20, Fig. 21 that, for the same crack ratio, the crack extension direction at different positions is generally the same, while the extension length varies. The crack near the root of the blade (at position 1) has a relatively larger extension depth, while the crack near the tip of the blade (at position 4) exhibits smaller extension, with little growth, only extending by 1–2 units.

Moreover, by comparing the initial crack extension patterns at the same position with different crack ratios, it can be observed that the extension angle of the crack varies, with different crack ratios causing a change in the direction of the initial crack propagation. Specifically, when the crack ratio is 0.2, the crack initially propagates along the longitudinal direction and then primarily extends to the peripheral units along the transverse direction. In contrast, at position 1, the crack propagates solely along the longitudinal direction. Crack propagation dynamics exhibit significant dependency on initial defect geometry, with increasing (a/b) inducing two concurrent phenomena: (1) reduction of in-plane crack deflection angles (θ) from 28.2° at a/b = 0.05–11.25° at a/b = 0.20, and (2) accelerated through-thickness penetration rates increasing dramatically from 1.35 × 10−4 mm/cycle to 1.86 × 10−3 mm/cycle. Quantitative crack evolution metrics—including total propagation lengths and fatigue cycle counts are systematically cataloged in Fig. 22 and Table 8.

4.3. Fatigue cracking threshold
For the fatigue crack threshold analysis, this study uses the critical crack ratio as the reference for threshold determination and investigates the effect of initial crack positions from position 1 to position 4. It can be found that when the crack ratio (a/b) is 0.05, the initial crack shows minimal extension after 2 × 104 cycles, indicating the onset of cracking without significant propagation toward a through crack. Based on the previous work, it can be concluded that the minimum crack ratio can be analyzed as the critical crack ratio. When a/b = 0.05, the fatigue crack expansion pattern of the tidal energy turbine blade after 4 × 104 cycles is illustrated in Fig. 23. As shown in the figure, the initial crack does not propagate further to the next element to form a through crack, and the crack deflection angle (θ) and length have not changed with the increase in the number of cycles. Combined with the observation that for a/b = 0.1 after 2 × 104 cycles, the findings confirm that the minimum crack ratio (a/b = 0.05) is the critical crack ratio (safe crack ratio). If the ratio of crack extension length to blade width surpasses this critical crack ratio, the crack propagation reaches a dangerous level, with a high likelihood of advancing into a through crack. This would lead to a proportional increase in the final crack extension length, significantly compromising the safe operation of the tidal energy turbine and potentially causing substantial economic losses for the power plant.

5. Conclusion
This study establishes a FSI framework integrating ANSYS Fluent CFD and extended finite element modeling (ABAQUS XFEM) to investigate fatigue crack propagation dynamics in HATTs under variable TSR. Hydrodynamic loading spectra derived from URANS simulations are mapped onto structural domains to drive fatigue analysis. For fatigue crack growth morphology prediction in this study, the Walker equation was selected over the Paris model to explicitly account for stress ratio effects. While this formulation neglects load history dependence and frequency-related mechanisms-critical aspects for future refinement. The following conclusions can be drawn below.
(1)
Under different working conditions, the maximum static stress and maximum displacement of the blade increase with the higher speed. The maximum static stress occurs in the connection between the blade and hub, the maximum static stress value is 0.60 MPa, while the stress concentration occurs at the root of the blade; the maximum displacement occurs at the tip of the blade, and the maximum displacement is 0.76 mm.
(2)
Based on the XFEM, the initial crack extension simulation is carried out at different positions of the thin edge of the blade of the tidal energy turbine in Case Ⅱ as an example, and the initial crack extension paths and extension lengths are obtained at different positions. From the crack expansion pattern, it is found that the initial crack expansion depth near the root of the blade of the tidal energy turbine is relatively large, while the number of crack expansion units at the tip of the blade is relatively small, with only 1–2 units cracked.
(3)
Crack extension simulation analysis of different (a/b) of tidal energy turbine was carried out to investigate the effect of crack ratio on fatigue crack extension of hydraulic turbine blades and reveal the crack extension laws. The results of the study found that, with increasing (a/b) inducing two concurrent phenomena: (1) reduction of in-plane crack deflection angles (θ) from 28.2° at a/b = 0.05–11.25° at a/b = 0.20, and (2) accelerated through-thickness penetration rates increasing from 1.35 × 10−4 mm/cycle to 1.86 × 10−3 mm/cycle.
(4)
The crack deflection angle (θ) and length remain invariant with at a/b = 0.05 across 104 loading cycles. This threshold ratio demarcates two distinct regimes----sub-threshold (a/b < 0.05) self-arresting crack growth stage and super-threshold (a/b ≥ 0.05), accelerated propagation governed by Walker equation. The crack arrest threshold analysis can provide theoretical basis for damage tolerance design, safety life assessment, and maintenance cycle optimization of engineering structures, effectively preventing catastrophic fracture failure and ensuring the long-term reliability of key components under cyclic loading.
