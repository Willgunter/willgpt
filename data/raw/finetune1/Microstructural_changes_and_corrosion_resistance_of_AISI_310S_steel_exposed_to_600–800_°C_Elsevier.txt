Abstract
The microstructural changes in an AISI 310S stainless steel exposed to temperatures in the 600–800 °C range up to 210 h were investigated. Intense carbide precipitation occurs in all conditions. Sigma phase precipitation nucleates at the grain boundaries and becomes more intense with the increase of time and temperature. Intergranular corrosion resistance was evaluated by double loop electrochemical potentiodynamic reactivation tests. Sigma phase and chromium carbides cause severe sensitization, but healing is observed in specimens aged at 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C. Time to healing decreases with the increase of aging temperature. Anodic polarization tests were conducted in specimens aged for 210 h. Pitting potentials are found to decrease in all temperature tested.

1. Introduction
Austenitic stainless steels are commonly used to continuous and intermittent high temperature services [1], [2]. However, the use or heat treatment of these steels in the 450–850 °C promotes intense chromium carbide precipitation in the grain boundaries [3], [4]. When heated for small periods and/or low temperatures in this temperature range the steel becomes sensitized and susceptible to intergranular corrosion attack, due to chromium depletion near the grain boundaries [5].
High chromium and/or Mo-alloyed austenitic and duplex stainless steels are also susceptible to sigma phase precipitation during prolonged aging at high temperatures [6], [7]. AISI 316, 317 and 310 are the austenitic grades most susceptible to sigma phase precipitation, due to the Mo additions in AISI 316 and 317, and the high chromium content of AISI 310 (24–25%).
Intergranular chromium carbides increase the creep resistance [8], but decrease ductility, low temperature toughness and corrosion resistance. Sigma phase produces the same effects on duplex stainless steels [9], [10], and also increase the hardness [9], [11]. Previous work [12], [13] has shown that sigma phase precipitation can be the cause of failure of austenitic stainless steels used at high temperatures.
In the present work the microstructural changes produced by exposition of an AISI 310S steel in the 600–800 °C range for times up to 210 h were investigated. Intergranular corrosion and pitting corrosion resistances were determined and related to the microstructure features. Intergranular corrosion resistances were evaluated by double loop electrochemical potentiodynamic reactivation tests (DL-EPR). This test was firstly developed to austenitic AISI 304 steels [14]. The original test solution was 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.01M KSC. However, as the corrosion resistance of the tested material increases more aggressive solutions must be used. For instance, previous works on duplex stainless steels [10] used a 2 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M NaCl + 0.01 M KSCN solution. The determination of the best test solution for AISI 310S steel was also an objective of this work.
2. Experimental
Small pieces (15 × 10 × 5 mm) of a wrought stainless steel AISI 310S (UNS S31008 [15]) (composition shown in Table 1) were solution treated at 1100 °C for 40 min and water quenched. The specimens were aged at 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C for times up to 210 h. Table 2 shows the specimens identification adopted in this work. The specimen solution treated was designed as “ST”.

The DL-EPR tests were conducted in a conventional three-electrode cell using a Pt foil as the auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference one. The working electrode was constructed using the AISI 310 specimens embedded in epoxy resin grinded with grid 400 emery paper, degreased with alcohol and cleaned in water. The tests were initiated after nearly steady-state open circuit potential (Eoc) had developed (about 30 min) followed by the potential sweep in the anodic direction at 1 mV s− 1 until the potential of 0.3 V (vs. SCE) was reached, then the scan was reversed in the cathodic direction until the Eoc. The loss of corrosion resistance due to the chromium-depleted regions, i.e. the degree of sensitization, was evaluated from the ratio Ir/Ia, where Ia is the activation peak current of the anodic scan and Ir is the reactivation peak current in the reversed scan. Three test solutions were employed to specimens ST, A4, B4, C4, D4 and E4, in order to select the best one for the material studied: (1) original 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.01 M KSC solution; (2) 2M H2SO4 + 0.01 M KSCN and (3) 2M H2SO4 + 0.5M NaCl + 0.01M KSC.
The pitting corrosion resistances of specimens ST, A4, B4, C4, D4 and E4 were also evaluated by anodic polarization tests in 3.5%NaCl solution.
Microstructures were analyzed by light optical microscopy with specimens prepared by mechanical polishing and electrolytic etching in 10% acid oxalic solution (etch 1–8 V–60 s) or in 10%KOH solution (etch 2–3 V–15 s).
Thermocalc® software with TCFE3 was used for estimating the amount of sigma phase and Cr23C6 in equilibrium in a wide range of temperatures. TCFE3 is a database of Thermocal® recently developed which includes sigma phase parameters.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Microstructures
Fig. 1(A–F) shows some microstructures revealed by etch 1 (10% oxalic acid) solution. In all conditions the material presents intergranular carbide precipitation. Specimens aged at 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C were highly corroded because etch 1 also attacks sigma phase.

Fig. 2(A–F) shows the micrographs of specimens aged for 210 h and prepared with etch 2 (10%KOH) which reveals sigma phase. The specimen aged at 650 °C for 210 h presents very small intergranular particles of sigma phase (Fig. 2(A)). Sigma phase particles become coarser in the specimens aged at 700 °C (Fig. 2(B)). The specimens aged at 750 °C and 800 °C for 210 h present sigma precipitates with different sizes: very large particles coexist with other intergranular and transgranular smaller ones (Fig. 2(D–F)). The observation with low magnification shows a heterogeneous feature of the precipitation at high temperatures: besides the large particles, zones with high density of σ coexist with zones of small intergranular σ particles. As a result, the increase of time and temperature in the 600–800 °C range provokes the increase of the time and sigma phase precipitation.

Fig. 3 shows the weight fractions of austenite (γ), sigma (σ), liquid (L) and chromium carbide (Cr23C6) phases as function of temperature. This graph was obtained with Thermocalc® for the exact composition of the steel studied. In equilibrium conditions the amount of sigma phase decreases from 600 °C to 800 °C. However, as the γ → σ reaction is diffusion controlled the experimental observations show the inverse trend, i.e., the increase of temperature enhances the σ precipitation in aging times up to 210 h. However, the chromium carbide precipitation is intense in all range of temperature, probably due to the higher carbide diffusion.

3.2. Corrosion Tests
Table 3 shows the degrees of sensitization obtained with the three solutions tested in specimens solution treated and aged at 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C for 210 h. Solution 1 is not adequate because gives very low Ir/Ia, even in highly sensitized specimens. Solution 3, on the other hand, is too much aggressive, and gives Ir/Ia excessively high, even in the solution treated condition, which does not present carbides in the microstructure. Solution 2 was considered the most appropriated to evaluate sensitization in the AISI 310S steel.

Fig. 4 shows the variation of the Ir/Ia with the aging time at the four temperatures investigated, for tests with solution 2. Specimens aged at 600 °C were severely sensitized. Specimens aged at 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C show the same behavior: an increase of Ir/Ia followed by healing. This is caused by chromium diffusion, which reduces the depletion of this element in the regions adjacent to grain boundaries. Fig. 4 clearly shows that the increase of temperature accelerates the healing, since it is a diffusion controlled phenomena. Despite of the intense sigma phase and chromium carbide precipitation, specimens aged at 800 °C show very low degree of sensitization (Ir/Ia) in solution 2. However, healing was not observed during aging at 600 °C till 210 h. Fig. 5(A–D) shows the surfaces of some specimens just after the DL-EPR tests. Specimen A4 presents intense intergranular attack in accordance to their high degree of sensitization. Specimens C4 and E1 present a moderate attack and E4 is almost un-attacked, which confirms the healing with the increase of exposure time at 800 °C.

The pitting potentials of A4, B4, C4, D4 and E4 are shown in Table 4. It is observed a decrease in the Epit values in all aging temperatures, which indicates that chromium carbides and sigma phase precipitation both decrease the pitting resistance of the AISI 310S steel.

4. Conclusions
The main conclusions of the present study are:
Intense intergranular chromium carbide precipitation was observed in all tested temperatures from 600 °C through 800 °C.
Sigma phase precipitation was mainly observed in specimens aged at higher temperatures and times. Specimens aged at 600 °C, 650 °C and 700 °C for 210 h presented increasing sigma phase amounts, always restricted to the austenite grain boundaries. In specimens aged at 750 °C and 800 °C large sigma phase particles are observed with smaller ones. At these higher temperatures, intragranular sigma is also observed.
Chromium carbide and sigma phase precipitation provokes sensitization of the steel, i.e., increase the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion. DL-EPR tests were used to quantify the degree of sensitization in each aging condition. The best test solution to AISI 310S steel is 2M H2SO4 + 0.5M NaCl + 0.01M KSCN.
According to DL-EPR tests the material becomes severely sensitized at 600 °C. At this temperature the degree of sensitization increases with the aging time up to 210 h. Specimens aged above 650 °C show healing after some exposure time. This time decreases with the increase of temperature, since the healing is controlled by chromium diffusion.
