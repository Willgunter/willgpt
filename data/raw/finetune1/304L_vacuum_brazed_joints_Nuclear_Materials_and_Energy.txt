Abstract
This study systematically examines how brazing temperature influences interfacial intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formation and properties in Mo/BNi2/304L stainless steel joints for the EAST NBI electrode. Process parameters are optimized to enhance joint mechanical properties. Results reveal a layered interfacial microstructure: Mo/Mo2NiB2+ Ni3Si/Ni3B + Ni-based solid solution + Cr-B/Cr2B + Fe-Ni solid solution/ 304L. IMC development progresses from the interface inward: Mo2NiB2, Ni3Si, Cr2B form immediately at the interfaces during brazing, while brittle phases (Ni3B, Cr-B) form in the brazing seam center during cooling. Notably, the Mo2NiB2 layer is the weakest part of the interface. Brazing temperature primarily affects joint strength by altering the thickness of Zone I (Mo2NiB2, Ni3Si), with peak shear strength observed at 1000 °C.

1. Introduction
Fusion energy is a crucial solution to humanity's energy crisis[1]. The Tokamak, an essential device for controlled nuclear fusion[2], depends on Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) technology for plasma heating[3]. The ion source extraction system's reliability directly influences the neutral beam transmission efficiency and the facility's long-term operational stability. As the main component of the Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) system[4], the ion source extraction system includes the Plasma Grid (PG), Graded Grid (GG), Suppression Grid (SG), and Ground Grid (EG)[5]. The grid consists of a molybdenum (Mo) tube, a stainless steel support base, and a backing plate, all joined by welding. When molybdenum (Mo) is welded to 304L stainless steel, intermetallic compounds (IMCs) tend to form at the interface. These IMCs create a continuous distribution along the interface, which can significantly weaken the joint's performance. The electrodes operate continuously under high vacuum conditions (<10−6 Pa) and endure high-voltage discharges (up to 80 kV), intense thermal loads (beam power approximately 90 kW), internal cooling water pressure of about 0.7 MPa, particle bombardment, and long-pulse operating conditions lasting hundreds of milliseconds[6]. The Mo/stainless steel dissimilar material interface is prone to failure and vacuum leaks. This issue has become a major bottleneck limiting the development of high-power neutral beam heating technology. Therefore, the interfacial stability of Mo/stainless steel joints determines both beam quality and system reliability.
Welding techniques for Mo/304L joints primarily include laser welding and brazing. Current research on Mo/304L stainless steel primarily focuses on laser welding. For instance, Gao et al. investigated the regulation of interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) formation in Mo/304L joints through laser beam offset and interlayer materials, demonstrating that shifting the laser focus toward the 304L side reduces thermal input on the Mo side and effectively suppresses Fe-Mo IMC formation[7]. Furthermore, adding a nickel (Ni) interlayer boosts joint integrity by: (1) enhancing molybdenum (Mo) diffusion into the fusion zone, (2) raising Ni levels within the Mo-Fe interaction region, and (3) preventing harmful Mo-Fe intermetallic compound (IMC) formation, ultimately leading to high-quality brazed joints[8]. In contrast, fewer studies have reported on Mo/304L brazed joints. For instance, Min et al. achieved vacuum brazing between Mo and 316L stainless steel using BNi-2 brazing filler metal with a Cu interlayer. Results indicated that the joint interface primarily formed Mo-Ni[9]. Existing work has largely focused on similar systems. Jincheng Lin et al. investigated the growth behavior of intermetallic compounds (IMC) and the relationships between microstructure and properties in Mo/BNi2/FeCrAl brazed joints. Their study revealed that the brazing temperature and holding time have different effects on Mo-Ni reaction layer development, with temperature having a greater impact on the evolution of IMC thickness[10]. Wenchun Jiang et al. investigated interfacial reactions during the brazing of 304 stainless steel with BNi2 filler metal. Their study established that brazing temperature controls the distribution of brittle borides by affecting boron diffusion depth: higher temperatures (1100 °C) favor brittle-phase-free solid solutions in the joint center, while lower temperatures (1025 °C) lead to interconnected networks of Ni-B/Ni-Si-B brittle phases due to residual boron[11]. This pattern has also been confirmed in studies of other dissimilar material brazing systems, such as those by Xiong Shuai Ji et al. examined interfacial reactions during the brazing of SiCf/SiC tubes to Kovar alloy using AgCuInTi filler metal. Their research showed that the brazing temperature critically controls Fe2Ti nucleation and growth, with lower temperatures suppressing and higher temperatures promoting the formation of this intermetallic phase[12]. Therefore, temperature has a greater impact on intermetallic compound formation than other process parameters. The Mo/stainless steel electrode assembly uses tube-to-plate welding with very thin walls, small diameters, and minimal tube spacing-geometric constraints that make laser welding impractical. Although in-service electrodes in EAST are mainly produced through vacuum brazing, their high failure rate necessitates significant improvements in manufacturing quality.
In summary, improving electrode manufacturing quality involves controlled manipulation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at Mo/stainless steel brazed interfaces. Two main approaches stand out[13]: (1) optimizing process parameters, especially brazing temperature, to regulate IMC growth rates; and (2) adding strategic interlayers that modify IMC crystal structures and grain boundary configurations, thereby enhancing fracture resistance.
Addressing the quality enhancement requirements for Mo/304L dissimilar joints in Tokamak neutral beam ion source extraction grids, this study focuses on controlling intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in Mo/BNi2/304L vacuum-brazed joints. By optimizing the brazing temperature to prevent Mo-Ni IMC formation, we aim to enhance the Mo/304L interfacial strength. Microstructural evolution, reaction-phase growth kinetics, and crystallographic features were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Additionally, the effects of brazing temperature on joint microhardness, mechanical properties, and fracture mechanisms were systematically assessed.

2.2. Microstructural and mechanical characterization methods
The microstructure of brazed joints was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss Sigma 300, Germany) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental analysis. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) specimens were prepared through argon-ion polishing (Leica EM TIC 3X, Germany). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X) was employed to examine the microstructure of the joint interface between Mo/filler metal and 304L filler metal. The TEM specimens were prepared using a focused ion beam system (FIB, FEI Scios 2), achieving a final thinning thickness of less than 200 nm to meet diffraction requirements analysis. The phase composition of the fracture surfaces was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku Smart Lab SE, Japan). Room-temperature shear testing was carried out on a CMT4304 universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.05 mm/min. Specimen dimensions and fixture setup were as shown in, Fig. 3(a,b), and adhered to the YS/T 485-2005 standard. Three replicates per brazing temperature ensured statistical reliability. As shown in Fig. 3(c), chamfered edges on the fixture were used to prevent localized stress concentration at interface gaps, which could affect shear strength measurements[14]. Vickers microhardness profiles across the joint interfaces were measured using a Wilson VH3100 tester with a 200 gf load and a 15-second dwell time.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Interfacial microstructure analysis of brazed joints
3.1.1. Ultrasonic inspection of Mo/BNi2/304L brazed interfaces
C-scan ultrasonic inspection showed evenly distributed blue coloration, indicating consistent low-amplitude signals across the bonded interface (Fig. 4). No major anomalies, such as lack-of-fusion defects, porosity clusters, or crack indications, were detected, confirming strong interfacial bonding. The transverse red high-amplitude features correspond to intentionally machined grooves on the base metal surface. Edge artifacts with red high-amplitude signals appeared at the boundaries of the welded area.

3.1.2. Typical microstructure of Mo/BNi2/304L brazed joints
The interfacial microstructure of joints brazed at 1020 °C for 10 min was characterized as representative, showing a compact and continuous structure without observable crack-like discontinuities (Fig. 5). Distinct reaction layers formed at both Mo and 304L interfaces, consisting of three distinct zones: Molybdenum-side reaction layer (Zone I), brazing filler seam (Zone II), and 304L stainless steel-side reaction layer (Zone III).

Fig. 5. Representative SEM micrograph of Mo/BNi2/304L brazed joint microstructure (1020℃).

Zone I shows a laminar, light-gray reaction layer resulting from interfacial reactions between the filler metal and the Mo substrate. Zone II exhibits a triphasic microstructure consisting of: (1) a dark-gray matrix phase (matrix), (2) black particulate phases(particulate), and (3) irregular black blocky phases(blocky). The irregular blocky phases gather near the Zone I interface, while the particulate phases align linearly close to the 304L side. Zone III contains dark acicular and rod-shaped reaction products with dendritic growth extending into the 304L substrate, along with dispersed black particulate phases.
To further analyze interfacial microstructure and elemental diffusion behavior, EDS mapping was performed across the joint interface (Fig. 6). Zone I (Mo-side reaction zone) primarily contains Mo, Ni, Si, and Cr. Driven by concentration gradients, Mo atoms diffuse from the substrate into the filler metal, while melting-point depressants (B, Si) migrate from the filler toward the substrate.Zone II (brazing seam) is dominated by Ni, Si, and Cr, which diffuse in both directions into the substrates. Zone III (304L-side) shows Fe, Cr, and Ni as the primary elements. This elemental distribution confirms vigorous atomic interdiffusion during brazing. It should be noted that while the new EDS detector can detect B elements, the K-edge of boron overlaps with the M−edge of molybdenum[15]. Therefore, in areas containing Mo, it is impossible to qualitatively identify B in the sample. In areas without Mo, however, due to boron's characteristic X-ray energy being lower (0.183 keV), the signal-to-noise ratio is limited. The boron signal can serve as a qualitative reference rather than reliable quantitative evidence.

Fig. 6. EDS elemental mapping of a representative Mo/BNi2/304L brazed joint interface (1020 °C).

To clarify elemental distribution trends, EDS line scanning was performed perpendicular to the interface along the path: Mo substrate, brazing seam, 304L substrate (Fig. 7a). Results in Fig. 7d show that Mo exhibits a small high-concentration plateau near the base material, followed by a rapid decline into the braze seam, indicating that Mo's solid-state diffusion is mainly confined to the interfacial reaction zone (Ι zone). Elemental Ni and Si are significantly enriched in the braze seam, consistent with the melt-filling behavior of the BNi2 braze, with Ni diffusing slightly farther than Si. Cr concentration increases between 60 µm and 80 µm due to Cr enrichment in this region; meanwhile, Cr in 304L decreases sharply, and Fe indicates the dissolution of the parent material. Fe shows limited diffusion. The elemental concentration gradients suggest that mutual diffusion and reactions occurred between the brazing filler and substrate, leading to the formation of distinct intermetallic compounds.

EDS analysis of the light gray microarea A in Zone I shows that its composition mainly includes Mo, Ni, and small amounts of Si. The XRD pattern clearly displays characteristic diffraction peaks of the Mo2NiB2 phase. TEM bright-field images further reveal two distinct phases within this region: a bright, diffuse phase and a dark, blocky phase, indicating they are two different reaction products. To identify the phase structure, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis was performed on the bright phase (Fig. 8a). Its diffraction spots match well with the (001) and (011) crystal planes of the Ni3Si phase along the [100] zone axis, confirming this phase as Ni3Si. SAED analysis of the dark microdomain b (Fig. 8c) shows diffraction spots corresponding to the (011) and (002) crystal planes of the Mo2NiB2 phase along the [100] zone axis, confirming this phase as Mo2NiB2. In summary, within reaction zone I, the Ni in the flux underwent two reactions: part of it reacted with Si to form Ni3Si, while another part reacted with Mo and B to produce the ternary boride Mo2NiB2.
The dark gray matrix phase in Zone II is rich in Ni and is presumed to be a nickel-based solid solution. Scattered throughout this matrix are black dot-like phase D and irregular black blocky phase B located at the boundary with Zone I. EDS compositional analysis indicates that phase B mainly consists of Ni and B elements. Although the quantitative accuracy of EDS for B is limited, its characteristic X-ray signal is clearly identifiable. Baharzadeh et al. [16] similarly noted in their study of BNi-2 brazing of IN X-750/SAF 2205 dissimilar joints that while EDS struggles to accurately detect light elements like B, comprehensive analysis using XRD, SEM/EDS, and microhardness testing confirmed the formation of brittle phases such as Ni3B and Cr2B in the as-solidified zone (ASZ). Tillmann et al. [17] similarly observed in their study of BNi-2 brazed 304L joints that, even when EDS did not directly detect B, the presence of compounds like CrxBy and Ni3Si could be inferred by combining microstructural morphology with thermodynamic analysis. Furthermore, Zhang et al.[18] studied BNi-2 brazed joints between CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys and 304 stainless steel. Through EPMA and SEM morphological analysis, they confirmed the formation of CrB compounds within the ASZ at the center of the braze joint. Based on the combined literature evidence, it is suggested that the irregular block-like phase B might be Ni3B. Additionally, a linear arrangement of black dot-like phases near the 304L base metal, primarily consisting of Cr and B, is likely a Cr-B compound, as reported in existing studies.
In Zone III of 304L stainless steel, chromium precipitates and accumulates along grain boundaries at high temperatures, creating a network diffusion zone. Based on literature [19], this precipitate phase can be preliminarily identified as Cr-rich borides. These borides exhibit two morphologies: point-like (E) and strip-like (F), characterized by high strength and brittleness [20]. Their formation results from the reaction between Cr in the base metal and B in the filler metal. When the B content exceeds its solubility limit in the matrix, it promotes the precipitation of large amounts of Cr-B compounds along grain boundaries. Leone et al. [21] noted that B's extremely low solubility in the FCC structure further explains the tendency of CrxBy to segregate at grain boundaries. TEM diffraction pattern analysis revealed matching standard spots with the [101] and [1 3 –10] crystal zone axes of the Cr2B phase, confirming the presence of a stable Cr2B phase. Furthermore, based on morphology and composition, the light gray base phase in the diffusion zone is inferred to be an Fe-Ni solid solution.
Therefore, during the brazing of Mo/304L joints with BNi2 filler metal, the interfacial microstructure from the Mo substrate to the 304L side follows this sequence: Mo/Mo2NiB2+Ni3Si/(Ni3B + Ni-rich solid solution + Cr-B)/(Cr2B + Fe-Ni solid solution)/304L.
3.1.3. Formation mechanism of multi-layered microstructures in Mo/BNi2/304L brazed joints
As shown in Fig. 9, the development of key microstructural shapes was examined, revealing four distinct stages: (i) heating, (ii) Liquid Diffusion, (iii) Isothermal Solidification, and (iv) cooling.
1.
Heating Stage

Fig. 9. Schematic illustration of interfacial evolution in Mo/BNi2/304L brazed joints: a) Heating stage; b) Liquid diffusion stage; c) Isothermal solidification stage; d) Cooling stage.

As shown in Fig. 9a, the joint initially displayed distinct substrate interfaces with no visible interdiffusion. During the heating phase, the BNi2 filler metal gradually warmed, approaching its solidus temperature. When the melting phase began, a melting front moved through the filler region. At the same time, the Mo and 304L substrates maintained their solid-state microstructure, with only initial interfacial interdiffusion occurring at the substrate boundaries.
2.
Liquid Diffusion Stage
As Fig. 9b illustrates, upon complete melting, the filler metal enters the liquid-phase diffusion stage: capillary forces drive full substrate wetting and joint gap filling; simultaneously, active elements (Ni, B, Si) exhibit significant diffusional flux into the substrates; and subsequent interfacial reactions form intermetallic compounds (Mo2NiB2 Ni3Si, Cr2B).
3.
Isothermal Solidification Stage
Isothermal holding at the brazing temperature initiates isothermal solidification of the liquid filler. As melting-point-depressing elements (notably B and Si) continue diffusing into both substrates, the liquid composition shifts toward higher solidus values. This gradual change in composition causes a localized increase in viscosity, which reduces the liquid fraction and triggers isothermal solidification. As a result, a Ni-rich solid solution nucleates along the joint centerline, creating a pore-free microstructure with a continuous crystallographic orientation across the interface. At the same time, Mo2NiB2 borides grow preferentially at the Mo interface, forming a controlled interfacial distribution as shown in Fig. 9c.
4.
Cooling Stage
During cooling from brazing temperature to ambient conditions, microstructural evolution culminated in both the seam and diffusion zone: Terminal liquid phases, which underwent non-equilibrium solidification, formed brittle intermetallic compounds (Ni3B, Cr-B). At the same time, the joint achieved complete consolidation, resulting in a final microstructure with three distinct regions: Ni-rich solid solution matrix, dispersed intermetallic phases, and a chromium-enriched diffusion layer (as detailed in Fig. 9d).
3.2. Effect of brazing temperature on joint microstructure
Fig. 10 displays the microstructures of Mo/BNi2/304L joints brazed at different temperatures. The seam thickness changes in a non-linear way with brazing temperature, first increasing and then decreasing after 1100 °C. Similar to the microstructure described in Section 3.1, joints at all temperatures show three distinct regions. However, increasing the brazing temperature significantly modifies the morphology of each zone.

3.2.1. Thickness changes in various zones
As the brazing temperature increased from 1000 °C to 1060 °C, Reaction Zone I showed a steady increase in thickness from 4.05 μm to 7.53 μm, then to 11.50 μm. The width of Reaction Zone II initially expands and then contracts as temperature rises, from 35.95 μm to 40.86 μm, when the temperature increases from 1000 °C to 1020 °C. This is mainly due to the higher fluidity of the molten braze at elevated temperatures, which promotes the dissolution of the base metal into the braze and allows braze atoms to diffuse into the base. However, when the temperature is further raised to 1060 °C, the width of Reaction Zone II decreases to 25.90 μm, likely because the excellent fluidity causes the braze to flow excessively out of the interface gap between the two base materials. Meanwhile, the thickness of Zone III varies in a parabolic pattern with increasing temperature, initially shrinking before expanding, It should be noted that although the thickness of Zone III varies somewhat with temperature, its limited effect on the overall mechanical properties of the joint means this study does not include an in-depth analysis of its changes, offering only a brief overview.
3.2.2. EBSD analysis of Mo/Filler interface
To further examine the microstructural evolution mechanisms in Mo/304L joints at various brazing temperatures, EBSD analysis was specifically performed at the Mo/filler interfaces. This characterization generated phase distribution maps, inverse pole figure (IPF) orientation maps, and kernel average misorientation (KAM) strain maps, as shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13.

A heterostructured transition layer formed at the joint region shows distinct phase components across different zones, indicating complex reactive diffusion processes at the interface. This multi-phase structure affects the mechanical performance and fracture behavior of the brazed joints.
Fig. 11(a-d) shows EBSD phase distribution maps of joints brazed at 1000 °C, 1020 °C, 1040 °C, and 1060 °C. Key observations reveal that the thickness of the interfacial Mo2NiB2 intermetallic compound (IMC) layer increases steadily with temperature. At 1000 °C, a thin Mo2NiB2 layer exists alongside a braze center mainly composed of Ni-based solid solution with minor Ni3B precipitates. Above 1020 °C, the Mo2NiB2 layer thickens significantly, and clustered Ni3B brittle phases precipitate abundantly in the braze center. Further IMC growth at 1040–1060 °C occurs while Ni3B precipitation decreases due to enhanced boron diffusion from the filler metal into the substrate, aiding elemental homogenization. These results highlight temperature as the main factor controlling the formation and growth of the interfacial Mo2NiB2 layer.
Fig. 12(a-d) displays the inverse pole figure (IPF) orientation maps of the respective regions. A distinct crystallographic orientation difference is evident between the Mo matrix and the Ni-based filler metal. Conversely, the reaction layer (primarily Mo2NiB2 phase) shows fine, equiaxed grains. This structure suggests recrystallization or new phase formation during the brazing process. Notably, the average grain size of the Mo2NiB2 phase remains stable, with no significant variation across different brazing temperatures.
Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) maps (Fig. 13a-d) quantitatively illustrate local lattice distortion. High KAM values near the Mo substrate interface indicate significant residual thermal stress buildup during brazing. In contrast, the filler region shows consistently low KAM values, indicating minimal lattice strain. Notably, concentrated Mo2NiB2 phases display strong KAM increases, revealing substantial lattice mismatch at these intermetallic interfaces. Remarkably, the lattice strain distribution remains unchanged across all regions with respect to temperature.
Comprehensive characterization through EBSD, IPF, and KAM analyses confirms that the Mo2NiB2 interlayer acts as the primary weak point at the interface, significantly reducing joint integrity. Brazing temperature is the critical parameter controlling the thickness of this brittle phase.
3.3. Effect of brazing temperature on joint mechanical properties
3.3.1. Microhardness distribution
To investigate brazing temperature effects on joint microhardness distributions, Vickers microhardness testing was performed across the joint region. The base materials exhibited initial hardness values of 374 HV for 304L and 278.76 HV for Mo. The evolving hardness characteristics in the three distinct regions are analyzed below (Fig. 14).
The hardness of Zone I greatly surpasses that of the Mo base material because of the presence of brittle intermetallic compounds. This hardness exhibits a non-monotonic trend with rising temperature, initially increasing, then decreasing, and reaching a peak at 485.3 HV at 1040 °C.
Zone II reached its peak hardness of 471.2 HV at 1000 °C, then significantly decreased to 316.9 HV at 1020 °C before stabilizing at higher temperatures. This non-monotonic change results directly from temperature-driven intermetallic precipitation processes. At 1000 °C, limited boron diffusion encouraged substantial brittle boride (Ni3B/Cr-B) formation during cooling, which concentrated at the seam center and increased hardness. Temperatures of 1020 °C and above allowed complete filler melting and increased elemental mobility, gradually transforming the central microstructure into a dense Ni-based solid solution.
Zone III shows significantly higher microhardness (range: 423–487 HV) compared to the 304L base metal (185 HV), mainly due to the formation of chromium-rich boride phases (Cr2B) during diffusion-controlled interfacial reactions.

3.3.2. Shear strength and fractographic analysis
Fig. 15 illustrates the shear strength of Mo/BNi2/304L joints at various brazing temperatures. As temperature rises, shear strength initially increases and then decreases, following this trend. The maximum shear strength, 253 MPa, is observed at 1000 °C; at this temperature, interfacial reactions are adequate, but the proportion of brittle phases remains low. At 1020 °C, shear strength declines to 207.8 MPa due to intensified interfacial reactions, which lead to larger, more continuous clusters of brittle phases such as Mo2NiB2 with Ni3B and Cr-B. This clustering makes crack propagation at the interface more likely, weakening the joint’s load-bearing capacity, with the decline mainly caused by the organization’s brittleness. By 1040 °C, shear strength recovers to 238.75 MPa as the brittle phases’ quantity and size stabilize, and the joint structure partially reorganizes. Improved interfacial continuity helps increase strength. However, at 1060 °C, shear strength drops again to 208.79 MPa due to excessive reaction of the brazing material, which leads to increased interfacial element enrichment and the formation of a thick Mo2NiB2 reaction layer. The growth and connectivity of brittle phases facilitate crack penetration at the interface (Fig. 16), resulting in reduced strength.

Three distinct fracture regions are identified: Zone I (Crack initiation zone): Mo-side diffusion layer; Zone II (Crack propagation zone): central part of the braze seam; Zone III (Final fracture zone): 304L-side diffusion layer.

Fig. 17 shows high-magnification images of the fracture surfaces for Mo/BNi2/304L joints brazed at 1020 °C and 1060 °C. EDS point analysis was performed on key points, with results listed in Table 4. Analysis of the 1020 °C specimen (Points A, B, C) indicates that the crack initiation zone (I) contains elemental Mo, while the crack propagation zone and final fracture zone mainly consist of the Mo2NiB2 phase and braze alloy components. For the 1060 °C specimen (Points D, E, F), analysis confirms Mo in the crack initiation zone (I), reveals a mix of Mo2NiB2 and braze alloy in the propagation zone (II), and finds an Cr2Bphase in the fracture zone (III). To better identify the intermetallic compounds—including Mo2NiB2—fracture surfaces were examined with XRD analysis (Fig. 18). The XRD spectra confirmed all phases initially found by the EDS point analysis.

Fig. 18. XRD patterns of fracture surfaces (Mo side) after shear tests of specimens brazed at 1060℃.

Fracture path analysis, correlated with surface morphology, revealed distinct crack propagation behaviors depending on brazing temperature: joints brazed at 1000 °C, 1040 °C, and 1060 °C consistently showed cracks initiating within the molybdenum base metal and propagating along the Mo/braze interface. These cracks sequentially traversed Zone I (Mo-side diffusion layer), Zone II (braze center), and Zone III (304L-side diffusion layer). Joints brazed at 1020 °C, however, exhibited cracks that initiated from the Mo base metal and penetrated Zone I, but then mainly propagated within Zone II without reaching Zone III. This deviation at 1020 °C confirms that Zone I (primarily composed of the brittle Mo2NiB2 intermetallic) is the critical failure initiation site. Therefore, suppressing the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds is essential for enhancing joint fracture resistance.
4. Conclusion
This study used BNi2 brazing material to join Mo to 304L stainless steel at various temperatures. The effect of brazing temperature on the formation pattern and properties of IMC was thoroughly examined. The main conclusions are as follows:
1.
Typical brazing seams are mainly composed of Mo/Mo2NiB2 + Ni3Si /Ni3B + Ni(s,s) + Cr-B/ Cr2B + Fe-Ni solid solution/304L composite phase.
2.
As the brazing temperature increases, the thickness of the diffusion reaction zone I gradually increases. The width of reaction zone II initially increases and then decreases with rising temperature. Conversely, the width of reaction zone III decreases and then increases as temperature continues to rise.
3.
The shear strength of joints decreases as the brazing temperature increases, then fluctuates. Brazed joints at 1000 °C achieve a shear strength of up to 253 MPa.
4.
IMC development progresses from the interface inward: Mo2NiB2, Ni3Si Cr2B form immediately at the interfaces during brazing, while brittle phases (Ni3B, Cr-B) form in the brazing seam center during cooling. Notably, the Mo2NiB2 layer is the weakest part of the interface. Brazing temperature primarily affects joint strength by altering the thickness of Zone I (Mo2NiB2).
