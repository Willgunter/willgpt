1. Introduction
With the continuous advancement of the “Belt and Road” Initiative and the “Western Development” Strategy, major construction projects, including railways, highways, tunnels, and large-scale open-pit mines, have increased rapidly in the cold regions of western and northeastern China (Cui et al., 2021; Li et al., 2025a, Li et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2018). However, these regions are characterized by harsh environmental conditions, including subzero temperature freezing, frequent freeze–thaw cycles, complex tectonic stresses, and strong dynamic disturbances, that lead to significant variations in the mechanical properties and stability of rock masses (Gao et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a, Wang et al., 2025b). In particular, during open-pit mining operations, rocks are often subjected to prolonged water saturation and subzero temperature freezing, which alter their internal pore structures. These changes give rise to complex mechanical behavior and failure modes under dynamic loading (Gao et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a, Xu et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2021), thereby posing significant challenges to the safe and efficient extraction of ore-bearing rocks. Therefore, clarifying the dynamic mechanical behavior and damage failure mechanisms of saturated frozen rocks under impact loading is of considerable practical significance for open-pit mining engineering. Consequently, such research provides a solid theoretical foundation and valuable technical guidance for the design and construction of geotechnical engineering projects in cold regions.
As a natural geological medium, rock is composed of diverse mineral constituents and typically contains internal defects such as pores and microcracks. On the one hand, clay minerals within the rock absorb water and undergo swelling under saturated or water-bearing conditions; on the other hand, soluble mineral constituents dissolve, inducing microstructural alterations that consequently affect the rock's macroscopic physical and mechanical properties (Chen et al., 2024; Ding and Tang, 2024; Wang et al., 2025a, Wang et al., 2025b). Subzero-temperature conditions also play a critical role in governing the mechanical behavior of water-bearing rocks. When the temperature decreases from room temperature to below 0 °C, pore water begins to freeze and expand in volume, thereby further altering the rock's microstructure. When the water content is within an appropriate range, matrix shrinkage combined with the structural support provided by ice formation can enhance the mechanical properties of the rock (Jiang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025a, Zhang et al., 2025b). However, when the water content exceeds this threshold, excessive ice expansion induces frost-heave deformation and leads to a deterioration in the rock's mechanical properties (Huang et al., 2021). In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted on the static mechanical properties of rocks under subzero-temperature conditions, including strength, elastic modulus, and macroscopic failure characteristics, and substantial progress has been achieved (Liu et al., 2020; Weng et al., 2021).
However, in alpine and high-altitude regions, rock engineering is frequently subjected to dynamic disturbances resulting from mechanical operations and blasting activities. Therefore, investigating the dynamic mechanical properties of rock under subzero temperature conditions is of great practical significance for rock blasting and geotechnical engineering in such environments. The split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system is commonly employed to investigate the dynamic mechanical behavior of rocks (Guo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Among the influencing factors, temperature is a critical parameter for elucidating the dynamic response of rocks under subzero-temperature conditions. Rocks exhibit markedly different mechanical responses at room temperature compared with those under subzero-temperature conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that rocks generally exhibit pronounced mechanical strengthening at subzero temperatures compared with room temperature; however, the magnitude of this strengthening effect strongly depends on the rock type and physical conditions (Su et al., 2023; Weng et al., 2020).
In addition to temperature effects, the influence of water content on the dynamic mechanical behavior of rocks under sunzero-temperature conditions should not be overlooked. Compared with dry specimens, water-saturated rocks exhibit greater sensitivity to subzero-temperature conditions. Weng et al. (2020) reported that, within the temperature range of −10 to −50 °C, saturated siltstone displayed substantially larger variations in longitudinal wave velocity, dynamic elastic modulus, and dynamic uniaxial compressive strength compared with dry specimens. Du et al. (2024) further demonstrated that the presence of water decreases the dynamic compressive strength of rocks and mitigates their brittle characteristics. Conversely, under subzero-temperature conditions, the freezing of water-bearing rocks induces matrix shrinkage and the phase transition of pore water to ice, which strengthens intergranular bonding. Under specific conditions, this process may enhance the dynamic compressive strength and increase the propensity for brittle failure in the rock (Xu et al., 2023a, Xu et al., 2023b). Furthermore, the interaction between liquid water and ice within frozen rocks results in distinctive mechanical responses, with both strength and brittleness exhibiting pronounced temperature dependence (Lin et al., 2021; Liu and Wang, 2024).
Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that the mechanical behavior of rocks generally exhibits a pronounced strain rate strengthening effect. This effect appears to diminish with decreasing ambient temperature (Xu et al., 2023a, Xu et al., 2023b), but may be enhanced by increasing water content and under freezing conditions (Li et al., 2023). Notably, most existing research has focused on the damage effects of freeze-thaw cycles under impact loading. Results indicate that, as the number of freeze-thaw cycles increases, the dynamic strength and dynamic elastic modulus of rocks gradually decline, primarily due to the degradation of the rock pore structure induced by freeze-thaw action (Yu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023).
The above studies indicate that rocks exhibit complex dynamic mechanical behavior under subzero temperatures, particularly when containing water. While subzero temperature freezing can enhance the structural compactness and macroscopic strength of rocks, it also exacerbates their brittleness and increases the sensitivity of crack initiation and propagation. Although existing studies have preliminarily explored the mechanical characteristics and damage modes of rocks under impact loading, thereby providing valuable guidance for engineering construction in cold regions, several limitations persist. First, most existing research has focused on porous rocks such as sandstone and coal. However, low-porosity rocks such as dolomite differ significantly from porous rocks in pore structure and mechanical behavior. For example, dolomite typically has very low porosity (often <5 %), which gives it higher compressive strength and elastic modulus but also a more brittle failure mode (Wang et al., 2024a, Wang et al., 2024b). Under freezing conditions, low-porosity rocks contain much less water, so the pore-pressure effects of ice formation differ markedly from those in porous rocks, leading to significantly different mechanical responses. Therefore, it is necessary to specifically study the dynamic response of low-porosity rocks like dolomite under subzero temperatures. Second, the internal relationships among the macroscopic failure mode, energy dissipation, and microscopic fracture mechanisms of frozen rocks under subzero temperatures and impact loading remain incompletely understood.
The Barun Iron Mine in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, is located in a typical cold-region environment, where the surrounding rock is primarily composed of dolomite. Steep dolomite slopes are widely distributed throughout the open-pit mine, and their mechanical properties are highly vulnerable to strength degradation and structural deterioration under subzero temperatures and freeze–thaw cycles, thereby posing potential risks to slope stability. In addition, rock fragmentation in this mine relies heavily on blasting operations, and the dynamic mechanical behavior of dolomite at subzero temperatures directly influences blasting fragmentation efficiency and the optimization of blasting parameters.
Therefore, motivated by the engineering challenges associated with blasting operations in high-altitude open-pit mines, this study investigates the dynamic mechanical behavior of saturated dolomite under various subzero temperatures and strain rates using the SHPB system. By integrating energy dissipation theory, fractal analysis, and SEM, this work systematically examines the mechanical properties, energy dissipation behavior, fragment-size distribution, and microscopic fracture mechanisms of frozen dolomite subjected to impact loading. This study not only clarifies the temperature- and strain-rate-dependent dynamic responses of dolomite but also offers new insights into the coupling between energy dissipation and fractal characteristics, thereby providing valuable theoretical guidance for optimizing blasting parameters in high-altitude open-pit mines.
2. Experimental materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation
The rock samples used in this study are dolomite, collected from the Barun Iron Mine located in Baotou, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The mining area is characterized by a plateau continental climate, exhibiting annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 35.2 °C and −34.6 °C, respectively (Fig. 1a). Rock cores with a diameter of 50 mm and an effective length greater than 100 mm were extracted using a core drilling rig (Fig. 1c). The cores were subsequently sectioned into standard cylindrical samples with a length of 50 mm using a precision rock-cutting machine. The sample surfaces were polished to achieve smoothness and eliminate visible defects, thereby conforming to the standards specified by the International Society for Rock Mechanics (Fig. 1d). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of dolomite is shown in Fig. 2. The dolomite sample is mainly composed of dolomite (78.4 %), fluorapatite (20.3 %), and fluorite (1.3 %).

2.2. Experimental procedure and equipment
As shown in Fig. 3, after the preparation process, samples with surface dents or discontinuities were first excluded. Subsequently, the longitudinal wave velocity of each sample was measured, and samples showing substantial deviations in longitudinal wave velocity were discarded. The selected samples were then oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h until a consistent dry mass was attained. Thereafter, the vacuum saturation method was employed to ensure full saturation of the dried samples. First, each sample was placed in a ZK-270 vacuum saturation apparatus and subjected to a vacuum of −0.1 MPa for 2 h. Distilled water, with a level higher than that of the samples, was then added to the container, and the vacuum was maintained at −0.1 MPa for an additional 4 h. Subsequently, the samples were soaked for 24 h. During this period, the surface water was wiped off and the samples were weighed every 30 min until the difference between two consecutive measurements was less than 0.02 g, at which point the samples were considered fully saturated. The moisture content of the saturated samples was calculated using the following equation (Yin et al., 2024):

where ω denotes the moisture content of the saturated sample; and m1 and m2 represent the dry and saturated masses of the sample, respectively.

Fig. 3. Experimental procedure and equipment.

According to Eq. (1), the moisture content of the saturated dolomite sample was calculated to be 0.583 %. The static mechanical properties of the dolomite were determined using an MTS816 rock mechanics testing system, which yielded an elastic modulus of 32.78 GPa, a uniaxial compressive strength of 106.95 MPa, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.221.
As shown in Fig. 3, the SHPB system was utilized to perform dynamic compression tests. The SHPB apparatus comprises three main components. The first component is the power system, which comprises a control panel, a nitrogen cylinder, and a high-pressure gas gun. The second component is the impact system, comprising a 600 mm striker bar, a 3000 mm incident bar, a 2500 mm transmission bar, a 1000 mm absorption bar, and a damper for residual energy absorption. All bars are made of high-strength alloy steel, with a density of 7850 kg/m3, an elastic modulus of 210 GPa, and a longitudinal wave velocity of 5172 m/s. The third component is the data acquisition system, comprising two pairs of strain gauges attached to the incident and transmission bars, an LK2109A ultra-dynamic strain acquisition instrument, and a waveform memory unit. The impact velocity of the striker bar was controlled by adjusting the nitrogen pressure in the power system, thereby enabling the striker to strike the incident bar and simulate different dynamic loading conditions. A laser velocity detector was installed at the exit of the striker bar to accurately measure the impact velocity.
In this study, impact mechanical tests were conducted on saturated dolomite samples at temperatures of 25 °C, −10 °C, −20 °C, −30 °C, and −40 °C. These tests were designed to investigate the dynamic mechanical responses and failure mechanisms of dolomite under subzero temperature and impact loading conditions. To clarify the influence of water on the mechanical behavior of dolomite under subzero temperatures conditions, 25 °C, −20 °C, and −40 °C were selected for the dry samples as a control group. In addition, impact compression tests were performed at −10 °C under loading pressures of 0.26 MPa, 0.34 MPa, 0.42 MPa, and 0.50 MPa to assess the strain rate effect on saturated dolomite at subzero temperatures.
The dry and saturated samples were placed in a subzero temperature chamber and frozen at their designated test temperatures for a duration of 24 h. After freezing, the samples were promptly removed from the chamber and subjected to impact testing. Considering the extremely short duration of each test, the influence of ambient temperature fluctuations on the experimental results was deemed negligible. Three parallel tests were conducted for each temperature or strain rate condition to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the experimental results.
2.3. Experimental data processing
Following the completion of the impact tests, the axial stress, axial strain, and strain rate of the samples were determined using the three-wave method, in accordance with the one-dimensional elastic wave propagation theory and the stress equilibrium assumption (Lifshitz and Leber, 1994; Shan et al., 2000). The corresponding formulas for the calculations are presented as follows:
(2)
(3)
(4)
where 
, 
 and 
 denote the axial stress, axial strain and strain rate, respectively; 
, 
 and 
 represent the strain signals of the incident, reflected and transmitted waves, respectively; E0 is the elastic modulus of the pressure bar; A0 and As are the cross-sectional areas of the bar and the sample; C0 is the longitudinal wave velocity of the bar; and Is is the length of the sample.
Rock impact failure is considered an energy-dominated instability process, in which the failure mechanism results from the dynamic balance among energy conversion, dissipation, and release. Based on the principle of energy conservation, the energy of the rock during dynamic compression tests is determined from the following relationship (Lu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020):
(5)
(6)
(7)
where WI, WR and WT denote the incident, reflected, and transmitted energies, respectively; and 
, 
 and 
 represent the stresses measured in the incident bar, reflected bar, and transmitted bar, respectively.
During rock impact failure, the fracture energy accounts for approximately 95 % of the total dissipated energy, showing a strong linear correlation, whereas the kinetic energy generated by sample fragmentation constitutes approximately 5 % of the total dissipated energy (Ping et al., 2015). Consequently, the rock's absorbed energy can be approximated by its dissipated energy, WL, which is calculated as follows:
(8)
In order To minimize the influence of sample volume on the test results, the energy dissipation density, η, is introduced as an evaluation metric to quantitatively characterize the energy absorption capacity and damage degree of the rock. η can be calculated using the following formula (Xia et al., 2025):
(9)
where η represents the energy dissipation density; and Vs denotes the volume of the rock sample.
Rock fragments are the direct products of crack propagation. Quantitative characterization of rock fragmentation using the fractal dimension can effectively characterize the damage evolution of the rock under impact loading. Accordingly, in this study, a multi-stage sieve was employed to classify the rock samples following impact crushing. The sieve sizes were 0.025 mm, 0.075 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, and 40 mm. After sieving, the mass of rock fragments retained on each sieve stage was measured using a high-precision electronic balance. The fractal dimension, D, of the rock after impact failure was subsequently calculated using the following formula (Chen et al., 2022):
(10)
where MR denotes the cumulative mass of fragments smaller than size R; MT represents the total mass of the sample; R is the size of the crushed fragments; and RM is the maximum fragment size. By taking the logarithm of both sides of the Eq.(10), the following relationship is thus obtained:
(11)
The fractal dimension of the sample's fragmentation distribution can be determined by plotting lg(MR/MT) against lgR and by calculating the slope of the resulting linear regression line. Following the fragment screening tests, SEM was employed to examine the microscopic characteristics of the fracture surfaces, thereby revealing the mechanisms of crack propagation and internal structural evolution of the samples.

3.1.1. Dynamic balance verification
Fig. 4 illustrates the stress equilibrium recorded in a representative dynamic compression test. As shown in Fig. 4a, the superimposed curve of the incident and reflected wave-time histories closely matches the transmission wave time history curve, thereby satisfying the dynamic equilibrium verification, which indicates the reliability of the impact test data. As shown in Fig. 4b, the average value of the plateau region of the strain rate-time curve was chosen as the representative strain rate parameter for the impact test.

3.1.2. Dynamic stress-strain curve
The stress–strain relationship provides a direct representation of the evolution of internal stresses and deformations in the sample under dynamic compression loading. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 depict the dynamic stress–strain curves of dry and saturated samples over a temperature range from −40 °C to 25 °C. The stress–strain curves display similar trends under all test conditions and can be classified into four distinct phases: linear elastic, nonlinear elastoplastic, plastic yielding, and post-peak strain softening. The first stage represents the linear elastic phase. Due to the instantaneous nature of the impact load, internal cracks within the sample remain partially open, resulting in a steep slope, high stiffness, and an approximately linear stress–strain response. This behavior contrasts markedly with the initial compaction phase observed in quasi-static stress–strain curves. In the nonlinear elastoplastic stage, the stress–strain slope decreases significantly, indicating reduced sample stiffness. Most of the externally absorbed energy is converted into elastic strain energy, while a small portion is dissipated, facilitating the initiation and propagation of microcracks. The third stage represents the plastic-dominated deformation phase. Stored elastic energy is released, leading to rapid microcrack growth and their coalescence into macrocracks. Simultaneously, the stress–strain slope gradually approaches zero, reflecting reduced stiffness, while strain increases substantially, culminating in peak stress. It is noteworthy that the boundary between the elastoplastic deformation stage and the plastic yielding stage is defined at the inflection point where the slope of the stress–strain curve decreases markedly. After reaching peak stress, the sample undergoes further deformation, accompanied by the formation of numerous macroscopic cracks on its surface. The load-bearing capacity then declines sharply, ultimately resulting in complete structural failure, with the stress–strain curve exhibiting a negative slope.

The evolution of the impact stress–strain curves for dry and saturated rock under varying temperature conditions is generally similar, with notable differences in the characteristics of each stage. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 indicate that, as the temperature decreases, the stiffness during the initial stage of the stress–strain curves for both dry and saturated samples increases significantly, thereby enhancing the rock's resistance to deformation. The plastic yielding stage of the samples shows a shortening trend as the temperature decreases, indicating that subzero temperatures increase the brittleness of the rock, thereby rendering it more susceptible to brittle failure. Furthermore, as the temperature decreases, the peak stress and load-bearing capacity of the samples increase, while the corresponding strain decreases. Notably, the post-peak stress–strain behavior is minimally influenced by temperature, showing no distinct trend.
As shown in Fig. 7, the dynamic stress–strain curves of samples at subzero temperatures under varying strain rates also exhibit four distinct stages at each temperature. With increasing strain rate, the slope of the initial portion of the curve increases, and both the peak stress and the corresponding axial strain rise. These strain rate–dependent characteristics suggest that the load-bearing capacity and deformation behavior of subzero temperature saturated rocks are strongly influenced by the applied loading conditions.

Fig. 8 illustrates the variation of dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of rock samples as a function of temperature. As shown in Fig. 8a, both the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of dry and saturated samples increase with decreasing temperature. Specifically, the dynamic compressive strength of dry samples at −20 °C and −40 °C is 133.51 MPa and 135.43 MPa, respectively, with corresponding dynamic elastic moduli of 80.7 GPa and 82.0 GPa. Compared with the values at room temperature, the dynamic compressive strength increased by 2.16 % and 3.63 %, with the dynamic elastic modulus increasing by 2.54 % and 4.19 %, respectively. Notably, the interaction between water saturation and subzero temperature significantly affects the dynamic mechanical properties of the samples. At room temperature, the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the saturated sample are 128.94 MPa and 75.3 GPa, respectively, both lower than those of the dry sample at the same temperature. When the temperature decreases to −10 °C, the dynamic compressive strength increases by 3.74 % to 133.76 MPa, while the dynamic elastic modulus increases by 5.84 % to 79.7 GPa. As the temperature further decreases to −20 °C, −30 °C, and −40 °C, the dynamic compressive strength of the saturated sample increases to 135.45 MPa, 139.20 MPa, and 140.92 MPa, with the corresponding dynamic elastic modulus increasing to 82.7 GPa, 84.3 GPa, and 84.7 GPa, respectively, relative to the values at room temperature. Relative to room temperature, the dynamic compressive strength increased by 5.05 %, 7.96 %, and 9.29 %, with the dynamic elastic modulus increasing by 9.83 %, 11.95 %, and 12.48 %, respectively. Under the corresponding subzero temperature conditions, the increments in dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of saturated samples are greater than those observed for dry samples.

As shown in Fig. 8b, within the temperature range of −10 °C to −40 °C, the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the saturated samples exhibit a pronounced linear relationship with temperature.
Fig. 9 illustrates the relationship between dynamic compressive strength, dynamic elastic modulus, and strain rate for frozen, saturated samples. As shown in Fig. 9a, the strain rate exerts a pronounced influence on the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the frozen, saturated rock. Under impact pressures of 0.26, 0.34, 0.42, and 0.50 MPa (corresponding to average strain rates of 128.19 s−1, 172.05 s−1, 234.36 s−1, and 275.86 s−1), the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the frozen, saturated samples are 118.00, 133.76, 149.91, and 159.50 MPa, and 59.0, 79.7, 102.3, and 130.7 GPa, respectively. When the strain rate increases from 128.19 s−1 to 275.86 s−1, the dynamic compressive strength of the frozen, saturated rock increases by 35.17 %, with the dynamic elastic modulus increasing by 121.53 %.

Within the strain rate range investigated in this study, the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the frozen, saturated rock exhibit a pronounced strain-rate-dependent strengthening effect.

Fig. 11. Impact failure modes of samples under different strain rates.

The cumulative mass percentages of dry and saturated samples at different temperatures were determined through sieving tests, as presented in Fig. 12a and Fig. 12b. Under subzero temperature conditions, the degree of sample fragmentation increases with decreasing temperature. Specifically, at −10 °C, −20 °C, −30 °C, and −40 °C, the cumulative mass fraction of fragments within the 0–5 mm size range for saturated samples is 20.27 %, 26.39 %, 31.55 %, and 32.60 %, respectively, showing a clear increasing trend as temperature decreases. At room temperature, the cumulative mass fractions of fragments within the 0–10 mm size range are 25.80 % and 46.76 % for dry and saturated samples, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation observed in the saturated samples under impact loading reflects the weakening effect of water on the rock's mechanical integrity. Furthermore, at −20 °C and − 40 °C, the cumulative mass fractions of fragments within the 0–5 mm size range for dry samples are 23.94 % and 21.06 %, respectively, lower than those of the corresponding saturated samples, suggesting that saturated samples undergo more severe fragmentation under impact loading after freezing at subzero temperatures.

Fig. 12c and Fig. 12d present the lg(MR/MT)-lgR fitting curves for dry and saturated samples at different temperatures, respectively. All fitting curves have correlation coefficients exceeding 0.98, demonstrating that the post-impact fragmentation distributions of the samples exhibit strong self-similarity and pronounced fractal characteristics.
Fig. 12e illustrates the relationship between the fractal dimension and temperature for dry and saturated samples. The fractal dimension of both dry and saturated samples increases progressively as temperature decreases. Specifically, the fractal dimension of the dry sample at room temperature was 2.059, while at −20 °C and −40 °C it increased to 2.128 and 2.138, corresponding to increases of 3.35 % and 3.83 %, respectively. For saturated samples, the fractal dimension at room temperature is 2.108, which is higher than that of dry samples under the same conditions. As the temperature decreases to −10 °C, the fractal dimension increases by 0.71 % to 2.123. As the temperature further decreases to −20 °C, −30 °C, and − 40 °C, the fractal dimensions of saturated samples increase to 2.148, 2.175, and 2.194, representing increases of 1.90 %, 3.18 %, and 4.08 % relative to room temperature.
As shown in Fig. 12f, the fractal dimension of saturated samples fitted against temperature reveals a significant quadratic polynomial relationship within the range of −10 °C to −40 °C, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.995.
Fig. 13 illustrates the fragment size distribution of frozen saturated rock under varying strain rates. As the strain rate increases, the degree of fragmentation of frozen saturated rock increases. As shown in Fig. 13a, in the 0–10 mm size range, the cumulative mass of fragments for strain rates of 132.25 s−1, 173.86 s−1, 232.43 s−1, and 271.74 s−1 accounts for 18.41 %, 38.21 %, 68.70 %, and 90.43 % of the total sample mass, respectively, showing a clear increasing trend. This indicates that higher impact loading promotes the formation of finer fragments, leading to more severe rock breakage. Data fitting shows that the fractal dimension of frozen saturated samples increases quadratically with increasing strain rate (Fig. 13c). Specifically, at a strain rate of 132.25 s−1, the fractal dimension of the frozen saturated sample is 1.891. As the strain rate increases to 173.86 s−1, 232.43 s−1, and 271.74 s−1, the fractal dimensions rise to 2.123, 2.202, and 2.286, corresponding to increases of 12.27 %, 16.44 %, and 20.89 %, respectively.

3.2.2. Energy dissipation characteristics
The energy evolution during rock dynamic compression tests can be characterized using energy-time curves. As shown in Fig. 14, during the impact process, the incident, reflected, transmitted, and dissipated energies all initially increase rapidly and then stabilize over time. The figure indicates that, during impact-induced failure, the incident and reflected energies are higher than the transmitted and dissipated energies. This phenomenon is attributed to the rock's low wave impedance, causing the impact stress wave to predominantly reflect at the interface between the incident bar and the sample. Consequently, only a small portion of the energy contributes to sample failure, while the remaining energy continues to propagate through the transmission bar. Therefore, the transmitted and dissipated energies are substantially lower than the incident and reflected energies.

Fig. 14. Dynamic energy-time curve of sample.

Fig. 15a presents the dynamic energy values of dry and saturated samples at various temperatures. The diagram indicates that, under identical impact pressures, the incident energy of the samples remains nearly constant. As the temperature decreases, the samples become denser due to thermal contraction and the water-ice phase transition, which increases wave impedance, reduces reflected energy, and concurrently increases transmitted and dissipated energies. For instance, at room temperature, the saturated sample exhibits an incident energy of 253 J, with reflected, transmitted, and dissipated energies of 160 J, 41 J, and 52 J, respectively. As the temperature decreases to −10 °C, −20 °C, −30 °C, and −40 °C, the reflected energy of the saturated sample decreases to 150 J, 143 J, 135 J, and 128 J, respectively, whereas the transmitted and dissipated energies increase to 50 J, 55 J, 58 J, and 62 J, and 55 J, 58 J, 60 J, and 64 J, respectively. Compared with room temperature, at −40 °C, reflected energy decreases by 20 %, while transmitted and dissipated energies increase by 51 % and 23 %, respectively.

Fig. 15b illustrates the relationship between energy dissipation density and temperature. As the temperature decreases, the energy dissipation densities of both dry and saturated samples increase progressively. Specifically, at room temperature, the energy dissipation densities of the dry and saturated samples are 0.49 J/cm3 and 0.53 J/cm3, respectively. The saturated sample exhibits an 8.16 % higher energy dissipation density than the dry sample. As the temperature decreases to −20 °C and −40 °C, the energy dissipation density of the dry samples increases by 8.16 % and 12.24 %, reaching 0.53 and 0.55 J/cm3, respectively. When the temperature decreases to −10 °C, the energy dissipation density of the saturated sample increases by 5.66 %, reaching 0.56 J/cm3. With a further decrease in temperature to −20 °C, −30 °C, and −40 °C, the energy dissipation density rises to 0.59, 0.61, and 0.66 J/cm3, corresponding to relative increases of 11.32 %, 15.09 %, and 24.53 % compared with the room-temperature saturated sample. Within the temperature range of −10 °C to −40 °C, the reflection, transmission, dissipation energies, and energy dissipation density of saturated samples under impact loading exhibit a clear linear correlation with temperature (Fig. 15c).
Fig. 16 presents the energy parameters of frozen saturated samples under varying strain rates. As illustrated in Fig. 16a, as the strain rate increases, the incident energy of the frozen saturated sample rises markedly, along with corresponding increases in reflection, transmission, dissipation energies, and energy dissipation density. At a strain rate of 128.19 s−1, the incident energy, reflection energy, transmission energy, dissipation energy, and energy dissipation density of the sample are 173 J, 94 J, 43 J, 36 J, and 0.37 J/cm3, respectively. At a strain rate of 275.86 s−1, these energy parameters increase by 288.44 %, 323.40 %, 225.58 %, 272.22 %, and 267.57 %, respectively, reaching 672 J, 398 J, 140 J, 143 J, and 1.36 J/cm3. These results indicate a pronounced strain rate effect on the energy response of frozen saturated samples. Data fitting indicates that these energy parameters exhibit a significant exponential relationship with strain rate (Fig. 16b).

To elucidate the relationship between the fractal characteristics and energy of frozen saturated samples under impact loading, a relationship model was established linking the fractal dimension with temperature and strain rate under different subzero temperatures and strain rates. As illustrated in Fig. 17a and Fig. 17b, decreasing temperature or increasing strain rate leads to higher energy dissipation density, greater sample fragmentation, and an increased fractal dimension. Fitting results indicate that, across different temperatures, energy dissipation density and fractal dimension exhibit a significant quadratic polynomial relationship, while at varying strain rates, they follow a significant logarithmic relationship.

3.2.3. Microscopic fracture characteristics
As discussed above, freezing temperature exerts a pronounced influence on the macroscopic mechanical behavior and failure characteristics of dolomite samples under impact loading, especially in saturated dolomite. As the temperature decreases from −10 °C to −40 °C, the dynamic compressive strength exhibits a linear increase. This behavior can be attributed to alterations in the internal microstructure of saturated dolomite at subzero temperatures, which increase its brittleness and enhance its mechanical properties under dynamic compression. Consequently, the fracture mode is modified. Comparing the microscopic fracture characteristics of dolomite samples at different temperatures under impact loading provides an intuitive insight into the effect of temperature on their brittleness.
Fig. 18 presents SEM images of the dynamic compression fracture surfaces of saturated frozen dolomite samples at various temperatures. It can be observed that, under identical impact loading conditions, the fracture morphology of dolomite predominantly exhibits brittle characteristics. However, as illustrated in Fig. 18a, The fracture surface of dolomite at room temperature not only shows typical brittle characteristics, such as river patterns, but also exhibits dimple pattern and slip separation associated with ductile fracture morphologies (Zhou et al., 2020), reflecting localized ductile fracture behavior. This composite fracture mode may result from substantial plastic deformation of dolomite under ambient temperature and water content conditions prior to failure. Such deformation allows cracks to gradually absorb energy and form pit-like structures. As the temperature decreases from ambient to subzero conditions, the fracture surfaces of dolomite samples increasingly exhibit pronounced brittle characteristics. As illustrated in Fig. 18b, the fracture surface at −10 °C exhibits typical brittle features, including intergranular cracks, lamellar tearing, river patterns, and brittle cracks (Li et al., 2025a, Li et al., 2025b). At −20 °C, the fracture surface displays brittle features, including brittle cracks, lamellar tearing, and river patterns (Fig. 18c). At −30 °C, the fracture surface clearly exhibits lamellar tearing, river patterns, brittle cracks, and cleavage steps (Fig. 18d). At −40 °C, the fracture surface clearly exhibits cleavage steps, brittle cracks, intergranular fractures, and lamellar tearing (Fig. 18e).

Freezing treatment significantly influences the microscopic fracture behavior of saturated dolomite. Specifically, at ambient temperature (25 °C), pore water within the dolomite facilitates the propagation of microcracks under impact loading (Jiang et al., 2022), which leads to the development of ductile features, such as slip separation and dimple structures on the fracture surface. Under subzero conditions (−10 °C to −40 °C), a water-ice phase transition occurs within the dolomite matrix. The presence of ice promotes rapid crack propagation along grain boundaries and weak interfaces, which results in brittle features, such as lamellar tearing, river patterns, and cleavage steps on the fracture surface. Furthermore, as the freezing temperature decreases, the extent of brittle fracture features expands, making the brittle failure characteristics increasingly pronounced.
4. Discussions
In summary, both water content and temperature exert a pronounced influence on the mechanical properties and damage evolution of the samples. With decreasing temperature, the deformation resistance of the samples increases, which is accompanied by higher dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus. This enhancement promotes greater energy absorption during failure, thereby leading to an increase in energy dissipation density. Furthermore, the extent of impact-induced damage increases with decreasing temperature, as reflected by a corresponding rise in fractal dimension.
The mechanical behavior of frozen samples is primarily governed by matrix shrinkage of mineral particles, the water–ice phase transition, and the enhancement of ice strength. Once the samples are saturated, the internal pores and microcracks become filled with liquid water, whose viscous characteristics enhance the overall energy dissipation capacity. Meanwhile, the lubricating action of pore water reduces the cementation strength between mineral particles, thereby decreasing the impact resistance of the material. Consequently, more complex crack networks develop during the dynamic fragmentation process, leading to a higher degree of sample breakage. The liquid water within the sample can be categorized into three types: bound water, capillary water, and adsorbed water. In subzero temperature environments, bound water, capillary water, and adsorbed water sequentially undergo freezing (Li et al., 2025a, Li et al., 2025b). Moreover, upon freezing of the saturated rock, a thin water film forms at the interfaces between ice and residual water, as well as between ice and the rock matrix. The unfrozen water film adheres to the pore walls along ice surfaces, enhancing the tensile and shear resistance of the rock. The adhesive strength of the unfrozen water film is primarily governed by its thickness and the freezing temperature (Chen et al., 2018; Guerin et al., 2016). The relationship between adhesive strength and temperature can be expressed as follows:

 and 
 denote the contact angles between ice crystals and rock and between ice and the unfrozen water film, respectively; 
and 
 correspond to the ice melting temperature and the ambient air temperature during freezing, respectively; and a and b are empirical parameters.
As illustrated in Fig. 19, with decreasing temperature from room temperature to subzero conditions, bound water, capillary water, and partially adsorbed water in the main pores—and in certain isolated larger pores—freeze initially. During the water-to-ice phase transition, the volume expands by approximately 9 % (Zhang et al., 2023), filling the pores with ice crystals. The presence of ice enhances the cohesion between mineral particles and contributes to the rock's compressive strength. Furthermore, under subzero conditions, the rock matrix becomes denser and harder due to thermal contraction and the ice-induced consolidation of the mineral structure. Therefore, under subzero conditions, the deformation resistance of saturated samples is enhanced, manifested macroscopically by increases in dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus. The freezing temperature of pore water is strongly dependent on the pore size, with smaller pores exhibiting lower freezing points, as reported in previous studies (Ashworth and Abeles, 1984; Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2025a, Zhang et al., 2025b). As the temperature decreases, ice within the primary pores continues to expand, driving unfrozen water to migrate into connected pores. Water located between small micropores, ice, and pore walls subsequently freezes, resulting in a reduction of the unfrozen water film thickness and a further increase in ice content. This process leads to the formation of end-closed pores in the branches of the primary pores due to ice crystal closure (Zhang et al., 2023). Simultaneously, the rock matrix undergoes further shrinkage, enhancing its effective bearing capacity. At even lower temperatures, additional space is required for the water-to-ice phase transition. Insufficient space for ice expansion may generate excessive tensile or shear stresses, initiating and propagating microcracks. Moreover, differential shrinkage among mineral components induces localized stress concentrations, potentially degrading rock mechanical properties. Nevertheless, within the studied temperature range (25 °C to −40 °C), no deterioration in the mechanical behavior of low-water-content dolomite (saturated water content 0.583 %) was observed.

Furthermore, the presence of cracks and micro-defects within saturated rock significantly influences its mechanical behavior under the coupled effects of load and temperature. According to fracture mechanics, external loading induces stress concentrations at crack tips, promoting crack propagation. The stress intensity factor (SIF) is commonly used to quantify the magnitude of stress concentration and is positively correlated with crack size. Under subzero temperature conditions, the phase transition of pore water causes the formation of ice that fills and occupies pre-existing cracks. This filling effect effectively shortens the free crack length, thereby reducing the mode-I SIF at crack tips. Recent studies have confirmed this mechanism: Zhao et al. (2024) demonstrated that crack-filling ice reduces stress concentration by decreasing the effective crack length, while Wang et al. (2021) reported that ice bonding strengthens the crack surfaces by providing additional mechanical support. CT observations further show that pre-existing cracks do not undergo expansion during the initial freezing stage (Zhang et al., 2024). Consequently, the reduction in stress concentration inhibits crack propagation and enhances the load-bearing capacity of frozen saturated dolomite.
5. Conclusions
Impact compression tests on dolomite at various temperatures and strain rates were conducted using the SHPB apparatus. The dynamic behavior of frozen dolomite samples was investigated; a relationship model between fractal dimension and energy dissipation density was developed. The microscopic fracture mechanisms of frozen dolomite were elucidated through scanning electron microscopy observations, and theoretical analyses. The principal findings of this study are summarized as follows:
(1)
Under impact loading, freezing temperature exerts a pronounced influence on the microscopic fracture characteristics of saturated dolomite. At 25 °C, the microfracture surfaces of saturated samples display both brittle features, including river patterns, and localized ductile features, such as dimple pattern and slip separation. As the temperature decreases to subzero levels (−10 °C to −40 °C), the fracture mode predominantly transitions to brittle behavior, characterized by intergranular cracks, lamellar tearing, river patterns, and cleavage steps, and the extent of brittle failure increases progressively with decreasing temperature.
(2)
The dynamic mechanical properties of dolomite samples are markedly influenced by both temperature and strain rate. As the temperature decreases and the strain rate increases, the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the samples increase significantly. Moreover, with decreasing temperature, the initial stiffness of the dynamic stress–strain curve increases, whereas the duration of the plastic yielding stage decreases.
(3)
Both freezing temperature and applied impact load significantly influence the energy dissipation mechanisms and failure characteristics of the samples. As the temperature decreases and the strain rate increases, both the fractal dimension and energy dissipation density of dolomite samples increase. Macroscopically, this manifests as a reduction in large fragments, an increase in small fragments, and an overall enhancement in sample fragmentation. Furthermore, under decreasing temperature, the energy dissipation density of frozen saturated dolomite exhibits a significant quadratic polynomial relationship with the fractal dimension, whereas, with increasing strain rate, the relationship follows a logarithmic function.
Although this study provides useful insights for cold-region rock engineering, several limitations remain. The tests were performed on frozen dolomite with fixed moisture content and intact structure, without considering repeated freeze–thaw cycles or pre-existing defects. In contrast, natural rock masses commonly contain joints and fissures, resulting in more complex thermo–hydro–mechanical responses under saturated and subzero conditions. Future studies should therefore examine the dynamic behavior and fracture mechanisms of defect-bearing rocks under varying moisture contents and multiple freeze–thaw cycles. Numerical simulations and advanced imaging techniques, such as NMR and CT, are also needed to further clarify the mechanical properties and failure processes of frozen rocks across laboratory and engineering scales.
