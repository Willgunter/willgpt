Abstract
First-principles calculations were utilized to explore the effects of Zr, Nb, Ta, and W on the solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of hydrogen in TiC. It is found that the trigonal site of H in TiC, which is encircled by three Ti atoms lying a {111} plane, has been identified as thermodynamically more stable. The addition of alloying elements will destroy the equilibrium distribution of the Ti-H interaction and reduce the structural stability of interstitial H. Furthermore, the solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of H in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) at finite temperatures are derived, and the results are discussed and compared with similar experiments in the literature. Drawing upon the influence of elemental alloying on H retention, we deeply understand experimental observations and provide experimentalists with a potentially valuable recommendation for controlling hydrogen permeability.

Introduction
Titanium carbide (TiC) has always been used not only for cutting tools and steel industry in the past years, but also as a promising candidate for fusion reactor as well as hydrogen separation sectors [1], [2], [3]. This is mainly due to its high melting temperature, good wear resistace, superior irradiation tolerance, and excellent catalytic activity [4], [5], [6], [7]. The severe brittleness caused by Ti-C bonds has been a major concern in the application of materials [8], [9]. Several investigations have been conducted to improve this problem by adding alloying elements to TiC. For instance, transition metal carbides solid solutions and superlattices with better performance have been synthesized via such experimental methods as mechanical alloying, spark plasma sintering, magnetron sputtering, etc. [10], [11]. Theoretical findings reveal the alloying effects of Cr, Nb, Ta, and W on the mechanical properties of TiC [12], [13]. However, as to the effects of alloying elements on its service performance after strengthening, it remains unclear and needs to be further investigated next.
As a plasma-facing material, it should be subject to the abundant escaped hydrogen (H) and its isotopes under a fusion environment, which congregate on the surface or permeate into the bulk of TiC, resulting in H retention. This phenomenon can cause bubble formation, material cracking, and degrading mechanical properties including strength and ductility [14], [15], [16], [17]. It is noted that additive alloying elements should have different roles in trapping hydrogen atoms, and the fundamental effects must be investigated in the following. In addition, transition metal carbides like TiC have found applications in the steel industry and hydrogen separation sectors [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], where distinct service performance requirements are imposed. As a coating material to protect steel, it is necessary to reduce the hydrogen permeability and mitigate hydrogen embrittlement. As early as 1992, Shan et al. reported that the permeability of tritium through the film of TiC coated on the surface of 316L stainless steel is four to six orders of magnitude lower than that in bulk [19]. On the other hand, the excellent hydrogen flux of transition metal carbides would increase the hydrogen permeability of Pd/TiC/V or Pd/Mo2C/V composite membranes [22], [23]. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of the effects of alloying elements on the solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of H in TiC is a possible remedy in the different areas of service.
Using highly credible first-principles combined with Sievert's law and transition state theory, our work seeks to identify the effects of elemental alloying on the temperature-dependent solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of H in TiC. First, the binding energies of interstitial H are examined, and then the dissolutions of H in TiC with elemental alloying are estimated. Moreover, the hydrogen migrations of TiC with elemental alloying are discussed and compared with each other. Based on the effects of elemental alloying on hydrogen dissolution and migration, the derived result deepens our understanding of the H retention of TiC products, and provides a useful strategy for designing alloying TiC materials with different H permeability.
Theoretical methods
Our theoretical studies were implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), and the approach called first-principles has been carried out in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) [25]. The plane-wave basis sets were performed in the present calculations, which expressed the interaction between ions and electrons through the projector-augmented wave (PAW) [26]. Exchange-correlations potentials were described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method [27]. The cutoff energy of 520 eV was implemented in all calculations. The k grids of 9 × 9 × 9 were selected for static calculations, while 9 × 9 × 9 for the calculations of density of states and energy barriers. The selected cut-off energy and k-point mesh density were rigorously validated to ensure convergence within a tolerance of 0.01 eV/atom. The Methfessel-Paxton [28] and Blöchl-Jepsen-Andersen [29] methods have been rigorously validated for their accuracy and were consequently selected for relaxation and static calculations, respectively. The force criterion acting on each atom during relaxation is 1.0 × 10-3 eV/Å, and the energy convergence criteria are 1.0 × 10-6 eV/atom.
A unit cell of 64 atoms (32 Ti and 32C atoms) was adopted for the present investigations of temperature-dependent H solubility, H diffusivity, and H permeability, respectively. The low content is usually investigated for TiC alloying in the experiment [30]. To save on computational resources, we selected one transition metal atom to substitute and construct Ti31MC32 (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) models, as shown in Fig. 1a. The optimized lattice parameters of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) were 4.339, 4.351, 4.343, 4.338, 4.337 Å, respectively. To further explore H behaviors, an H atom was embedded in the trigonal and tetrahedral sties of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32, and every structure with the addition of H has been fully relaxed. As a visual explanation, Fig. 1b–f show all the interstitial sites of H in Ti31MC32. It should be noted that there are four kinds of trigonal site (T1, T2, T4 and T5) and one tetrahedral site (T3). The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CINEB) method was employed to calculate the diffusion path of H with minimum energy barriers, as implemented in the VTST package [31]. Five image points were chosen, and all images were concurrently optimized along the diffusion path until the forces acting on the atoms in each image were reduced to below 0.02 eV/Å.

The zero-point energy theory (ZPE) was employed in the H atom, the ZPE correction of which is calculated according to the following formula:

The H atom creates a huge frequency difference from other Ti, C and M (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) atoms mainly attributed to its smallest mass in nature. Note that the ZPE correction was derived only from the normal vibrational mode of the H atom, while the Ti, C, and M atoms were fixed in each calculation.
Results and discussion
Hydrogen dissolution of TiC with elemental alloying
Our recent work has shown that the additions of Zr, Nb, Ta and W in TiC are thermodynamically, dynamically, and mechanically stable [13]. On this basis, we first discuss the influence of elemental alloying on the structural stability of H. The binding energies (Eb) of H in the trigonal and tetrahedral sties of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 without ZPE are calculated by
(2)
and the corresponding Eb with the consideration of ZPE is derived as follows:
(3)
where Etot and Ebul is the total energies of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 with and without H, EH represents the energy of hydrogen atom in a hydrogen molecular, and 
 and 
 signify of ZPE of H atom in the corresponding alloying TiC bulk and hydrogen molecular, respectively.
After a series of calculations, Table 1 lists the binding energies with and without the ZPE of H at the different sites of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32. It should be noted that H of Ti31MC32 cannot stabilize at the T4 and T5 sites after full relaxation, that is, the T4 and T5 sites are thermodynamically unstable and have actually relaxed to the T1 or T2 site. Interestingly, the tetrahedral T3 also relaxes to the neighboring trigonal site after the elemental alloying. Several characteristics can be observed from Table 1. Firstly, it is clear that the current Ti32C32 Eb value of T1 without and with ZPE are calculated to be 0.891 and 0.922 eV, which agree well with the literature values of 0.84, 0.988 and 1.07 eV [32], [33], [34]. The corresponding values of T3 and T4 seem closer to Ref. [34]. Moreover, the T1 of Ti32C32 is much lower than those of the T3 and T4 sites, suggesting that H at the trigonal sites is energetically more favorable than other interstitial tetrahedral sites. Our predicted conclusion is in good agreement with those findings of other theoretical studies [32], [33], [34], which shows the good accuracy and reliability of our DFT calculations.

Secondly, it can be seen from Table 1 that the Eb value of the T1 site is lower than the corresponding T2 site for all TiC with the addition of alloying elements, suggesting that H at the T1 site is more thermodynamically stable. Note that H at the T1 site is surrounded by three Ti atoms lying in a {111} plane shown in Fig. 1(a), while the T2 site has changed to be two Ti and one alloying atom. The equilibrium contribution of the Ti-H interaction is broken up by an additional alloying atom, which leads to a decease of H stability at the T2 site. Thirdly, the binding energies of all TiC T1 sites with the addition of alloying elements have the descending sequence of Ti31WC32 → Ti31TaC32 → Ti31NbC32 → Ti31ZrC32, indicating that the alloying elements should have an important effect on the stability of interstitial H. Specifically, the Ti31C32 Eb value of H at the T1 site is higher than that of Ti31ZrC32, while lower than those of the other corresponding sites with alloying elements. This direct comparison implies that only the substitution of Zr might improve the hydrogen trapping of TiC. The Ti31WC32 Eb values of the T1 and T2 sites are the highest among all sites, showing strongly inhibiting hydrogen dissolution by the addition of W into TiC. Additionally, the binding energies of H at the stable site with and without ZPE are similar to each other, and the most stable site has not been transformed with the consideration of ZPE. In other words, the ZPE correction has a negligible influence on the stability of H in the present system.
According to Sieverts' law, the solubility (C) of H in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 can be calculated by:
(4)
in which lT signifies the percentage of different interstitial sites each unit cell, P has been calculated using 1 atmosphere, and Ks represents the interstitial Sieverts' constant, which can be written as [35], [36]:
(5)
here α has been defined by our previous work [35]. T is the temperature, kB the Boltzmann constant, h and νi are Planck's constant and the normal vibration frequencies, and γi is the vibration frequency of molecular hydrogen, respectively.
Fig. 2 plots the solubility of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 as a function of reciprocal temperature, and the corresponding calculated results available in the literature are also included in the figure for the sake of comparison [33]. The derived H concentrations of Ti32C32 at 1000 K are 9.82 × 10-10, which is slightly bigger than other values [33]. The difference is due to the solubility statistics of H in different interstitial sites. The present theoretical values increase with the rise of the temperature, which agrees well the experimental trend under the same influence [37]. Such low H concentrations (e.g. only 2.94 × 10-21, at 300 K) indicate its excellent performances for the hydrogen resistance in fusion reactors. It can be seen clearly from this figure that the additions of alloying elements in TiC have different influences on the H solubility, i.e., an enhancement role by substituting the Ti atom by Zr at the same temperature, and the opposite trend with additions of the others. It should be pointed out, among alloying elements, that the substitution of Ti atom by W has the greatest mitigating effect on hydrogen dissolution. Moreover, the descending order of H solubility of Ti31MC32 at the same temperature is as follows: Ti31ZrC32 → Ti31NbC32 → Ti31TaC32 → Ti31WC32, which is exactly the same as that of the stability of the T1 site.

It is essential to deepen the understanding of alloying effects on hydrogen dissolution, and thus the electronic structures of H atom at interstitial sites of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 are calculated. As a great example, Fig. 3 gives the total density of states (TDOS) of H atom at the T1 site of Ti32C32 and Ti31WC32 for the sake of comparison. It is deduced, below the Fermi level (Ef), that the principal TDOS peaks of H at the T1 site of Ti32C32 situated at about −6.5 and −13.0 eV are a little lower than the corresponding site of Ti31WC32, and that its energy states are also more localized with a much smaller bandwidth. The above characteristics of density of states indicate that the H atom has created a stronger bonding at the T1 site of Ti32C32 than that of Ti31WC32, which could intrinsically deepen the understanding of the alloying effects of Zr, Nb, Ta, and W on H solubility discussed earlier.

Hydrogen migration of TiC with elemental alloying
Next, we continue to investigate the migration behaviors of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32. For a promising plasma-facing material, hydrogen diffusion is a determining factor affecting hydrogen retention and bubbles in fusion reactors. The diffusivity of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 could be described through the Arrhenius equation as follows,
(6)
where Ea is the activation energy from the diffusion path with minimum energy, T and kB have the same meaning as Eq. (5), and D0 is the pre-exponential factor, which can be represented by
(7)
where n is the number of equivalent diffusion paths, α is the jump distance, and h is the Planck constant.
By employing the CINEB method for calculations, Table 2 derived and listed the diffusion parameters of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32. It is worth noting that the diffusion of H starts from the most stable site, and migrates along the minimum energy barrier. According to the symmetry of lattice structures, the present system has one hydrogen diffusion path along alloying atom, and Fig. 4 shows the side views of the Z-Y and X-Z projections of the diffusion path. There are three steps of H diffused from a stable T1 to the neighboring T1 site, i.e., T1 → T2 → T2 → T1. It is clear that the H diffused from T1 to neighbor T2 and from T2 to neighbor T2 of Ti32C32 have energy barriers of 0.471 and 0.286 eV with the correction of ZPE, respectively, which agree well with the other values of 0.47, 0.497 eV and 0.284, 0.29 eV in the literature [32], [33], [38]. Therefore, the activation energy from T1 to T1 is deduced to be 0.471 eV along the diffusion path. Moreover, the activation energies and jump lengths were much higher and longer after elemental alloying, separately, suggesting that the elemental addition could make hydrogen diffusing in TiC more difficult.

Fig. 5 demonstrates the derived diffusivity of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 as a function of reciprocal temperature. The present values of Ti32C32 are much lower than the calculated data of other work [33], and the different of which is due to different barriers of H along the diffusion path of T1 → T1. One can discern clearly that the diffusion coefficients of Ti31MC32 are below the corresponding curve of Ti32C32 within the entire temperature range, implying that the four elements (Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) should decrease the diffusivity of hydrogen in TiC. More importantly, the diffusion coefficients of Ti31MC32 have the descending sequence of Ti31WC32 → Ti31ZrC32 → Ti31NbC32 → Ti31TaC32, which is different from the order of the H solubility as related before. A careful observation from Fig. 5 that the diffusivity of H in Ti31WC32 is close to that of Ti32C32 at a certain temperature, that is, the addition of W in TiC has an almost negligible effect on the hydrogen diffusivity.

The plasma facing W alloys with TiC added as a grain refiner are one of the hot spots in the field of fusion materials. Based on the above effects of alloying elements on H solubility and diffusion coefficient, we now discuss a little bit more about the result of H in TiC-W composites. The solubility values of H in TiC are close to the pure W data published recently by our group, eg, the H solubility of TiC at 800 K is 6.79 × 10-11, and the value of pure W is 1.36 × 10-10 at the same temperature [39]. Specifically, the diffusion coefficient of pure W is much higher than that of TiC, about ten times more at 800 K [39]. Such a phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen trapping capabilities of TiC/W interface regions will become moderately enhanced. The reason is that dissolved hydrogen is expected to migrate at a slower rate while accumulating more rapidly. In view of the above statements, we will give the experimentalists a probable helpful suggestion that the TiC reinforcements should be added with a small amount of W, in order to reduce the H solubility, maintain the H diffusivity, and eventually mitigate the H retention.
The H permeation should be an important safety factor considered in the actual application, which has been recognized as an expression of the diffusion limited regime. Base on the Fick's first law, the permeability of hydrogen (
) can be calculated according to the following formula:
(8)
where KS and D are the above Sieverts' constant and diffusion coefficient of hydrogen, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the calculated permeability of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 as a function of reciprocal temperature. It should be noted that the present H permeability of Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 linearly ascend with the increasing of the temperature, the trend of which is in good agreement with similar experimental results in the literature [40], [41].

Fig. 6. The calculated permeability of hydrogen in Ti32C32 and Ti31MC32 (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) as a function of reciprocal temperature.

Subsequently, we can find from Fig. 6 that elemental alloying would reduce the permeability of H in TiC, and the values of Ti31MC32 have the descending sequence of Ti31ZrC32 → Ti31WC32 → Ti31NbC32 → Ti31TaC32 within the entire temperature range. In general, the permeability is attributed to the common influence of both hydrogen dissolution and hydrogen diffusion. For the hydrogen permeability, there are three different situations. One is that Ti31ZrC32 has a higher H solubility and a lower H diffusivity than that of Ti32C32, and the H diffusion plays a dominant role in the low H permeability. The second is that Ti31WC32 has a lower H solubility and almost equal H diffusivity, and the H solubility is more critical to inhibit H permeation. The last one is that both the Ti31NbC32 and Ti31TaC32 have lower H solubility and H diffusivity than that of Ti32C32, and thus decrease the H permeability more drastically.
Conclusions
In summary, the influences of the alloying of Zr, Nb, Ta, and W in TiC on the hydrogen solubility, hydrogen diffusivity, and hydrogen permeability have been investigated through first-principles calculations. It is found that the trigonal sites surrounded by three Ti atoms lying in a {111} plane of Ti31MC32 (M = Zr, Nb, Ta, and W) are thermodynamically more stable. Calculations also reveal that the additions of Zr in TiC would increase and decrease hydrogen solubility and hydrogen diffusivity at a certain temperature, respectively. The substitution of Ti atom by W could drastically decrease hydrogen solubility, and has an almost negligible effect on hydrogen diffusivity. The alloying of Zr, Nb, Ta, and W in TiC all reduce the hydrogen permeability, and the derived results are fully discussed through the process of H solubility and diffusion. The alloying effects can offer a useful suggestion for experimentalists to design TiC products with different H permeability.
