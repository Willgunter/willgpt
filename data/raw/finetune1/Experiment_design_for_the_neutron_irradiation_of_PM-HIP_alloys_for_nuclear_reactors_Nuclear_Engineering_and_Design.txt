. Introduction
The nuclear power industry has historically relied on established manufacturing processes such as casting, forging, hot rolling, and extrusion, to fabricate structural and pressure-retaining reactor internal components. Deficiencies inherent to these processes, such as porosity and casting defects, grain structure banding in forgings, and laps in rolled product forms can compromise the structural integrity and longevity of components. Harsh service conditions in reactors, including high radiation fluence, high temperatures, mechanical stresses, and corrosive environments, further accelerate component degradation and failure. Recent advancements in material manufacturing methods are being studied extensively for nuclear applications (Lou and Gandy, 2019). Amongst advanced manufacturing technologies, powder metallurgy with hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP) is closest to becoming fully qualified for nuclear applications (Gandy et al., 2019).
PM-HIP components are of interest for both reactor internals (i.e., primary side) and secondary side components. For current and advanced light water reactors (LWRs), PM-HIP is proposed for reactor internal components including control rod drive tubes, fuel support bowls and castings, steam separator inlet swirlers, and core shroud supports (Gandy et al., 2019, Gandy et al., 2012). PM-HIP could also be used to fabricate the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) (Morrison et al., 2019), vessels and nozzles for small modular reactors (SMRs) (Gandy et al., 2019), and various structural components for advanced reactors designed to reduce longstanding nuclear waste volume challenges (Yano et al., 2018). On the secondary side, PM-HIP can be used to manufacture components such as valve bodies, elbows, seats, and stems, pump housings, and turbine rotors. Furthermore, PM-HIP could be used to reduce reliance on welds, which tend to exacerbate irradiation embrittlement and secondary phase formation (Mao et al., 2018, Mao et al., 2018, Mao et al., 2021).
PM-HIP ferritic and austenitic steels and Ni-based alloys are already qualified for non-nuclear sectors through ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section II. New specifications recognizing these PM-HIP alloys include: SA988/SA988M, SA989/SA989M, and SB834/SA834M. Additionally, BPVC Section II has also now recognized PM-HIP product forms in a similar manner to forgings and castings under BPVC Section II Part D Appendix 5. Specific guidance is now provided in Appendix 5 which describes how an individual new alloy may be qualified under ASME requirements. More recently, PM-HIP 316L austenitic stainless steel has been qualified for nuclear applications through ASME BPVC Section III.
Advancements in PM-HIP processing have dramatically increased component quality and manufacturable sizes to be comparable to castings and forgings (Gandy et al., 2019, Gandy et al., 2012). Additionally, PM-HIP manufacturing of stainless steel and Ni-base alloys is cost-effective (Maziarz and Isaacs, 2002). Thus, nuclear code-qualification of PM-HIP components could also shorten the multi-year lead times for heavy component manufacturing (Gandy et al., 2019, Morrison et al., 2019), which would compound the cost efficiency for component replacement and new nuclear builds.
Nuclear code-qualification of PM-HIP alloys requires a thorough understanding of material performance under service conditions, including irradiation. However, only limited studies have carried out irradiation of nuclear reactor structural materials fabricated by PM-HIP, providing spotty understanding of the effects of irradiation on PM-HIP alloys. All experiments have thus far been conducted at different temperatures and to different irradiation fluences. Further, none of the published studies have comprehensively characterized the irradiation response of PM-HIP alloys compared to their conventional wrought or cast counterparts. There remains a gap in our understanding of irradiation performance of PM-HIP alloys, especially with respect to conventional alloy fabrication techniques (Guillen et al., 2017).
The objective of the present study is to describe a systematic experiment that will comparatively interrogate both PM-HIP and conventionally manufactured alloys under consistent irradiation conditions and employ identical post-irradiation examination (PIE) equipment and techniques to ensure consistency in the comparison. The present study describes the alloys and irradiation conditions studied within a comprehensive, large-scale, and long-term Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) neutron irradiation campaign performed under the auspices of the Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF) within the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). Experiments are designed to systematically explore performance of PM-HIP alloys in typical LWR operating envelopes and understand temperature and irradiation dose functionality. In this manuscript, the irradiation experiment design is described, and the as-run neutronic and thermal analyses are documented. Future PIE plans are noted; forthcoming articles presenting PIE results will leverage the irradiation experiment descriptions herein.
2. Background
2.1. PM-HIP processing
PM-HIP is a forming and fabrication technique that consolidates metallic powders under high temperature (900–1250 °C, for most steels and superalloys) and isostatic pressure (50–300 MPa) to produce fully dense microstructures through solid-state diffusion. Powders are created through gas atomization, producing higher quality powders with lower oxidation than powder milling (Anderson et al., 1991). During gas atomization, an induction melted metal stream is forced through a nozzle at moderately high pressures. A gas is introduced into the molten metal stream as it exits the nozzle, creating significant turbulence as the entrained gas expands from heating. The molten metal forms into spherical particles, which settle at the bottom of the collection chamber through gravity or cyclonic separation. Powders can subsequently be separated by size.
A container used to contain the gas atomized powders during processing, is manufactured based on a three-dimensional model of the desired component dimensions. The can is typically made from thin-gauge carbon steel and is slightly larger in size than the desired component to compensate for shrinkage during consolidation (Gandy et al., 2012). The powder is packed into the container and brought to temperature under high vacuum, then a high-pressure inert gas atmosphere is introduced for compression and consolidation of powders (Gandy et al., 2012).
Compared to castings and forgings, PM-HIP microstructures are typically fine-grained, uniform, and contain fewer defects such as cavities (e.g., gas porosity, pinholes, blowholes), shrinkage, hot tearing, or cold shuts. These finer, homogeneous, defect-free PM-HIP microstructures enhance weldability, are conducive for component inspection because smaller flaws can be more clearly resolved and eliminate the need for costly overdesign to repair defects (which can comprise 10–50 vol% of cast components) (Gandy et al., 2019, Gandy et al., 2012). Chemically, the precision and flexibility of powder metallurgy allows for compositional tailoring with limited waste, while the HIP temperatures inherently limit elemental segregation. Additionally, growth of secondary phases (e.g., carbides) and the content of tramp elements such as B, S, and P, can also be more precisely controlled through HIP than through melt-based processes such as casting or forging (Gandy et al., 2016, Ahmed et al., 2014, Yu and Ahmed, 2009, Ahmed et al., 2013). Shulga (Shulga, 2013) has shown that chemical homogeneity and dispersivity of tramp elements and phase-structure elements are associated with improved tensile properties of PM-HIP 316 stainless steel and an Fe-12Cr (in wt%) ferritic/martensitic steel compared to their cast and forged counterparts.
More practically, containers for HIP can be more complex in geometry than a casting or forging, enabling PM-HIP components to be produced near their final shape. This results in a lighter weight product that requires less post-process machining and welding. The motivation to reduce welding and machining is particularly valid for stainless steels and Ni alloys, which exhibit work hardening that increases the difficulty of machining and introduces surface residual stresses that can lead to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) during service (Kuniya et al., 1988, Payet et al., 2019, Qu et al., 2022).
2.2. Performance of PM-HIP alloys in nuclear environments
PM-HIP materials generally exhibit superior (Morrison et al., 2019, Atkinson and Davies, 2000, Rao et al., 2003, Metals and Ceramics Information Center Report No, 1977, Shulga, 2012, Shulga, 2014, Barros et al., 2022) mechanical performance than their cast or forged counterparts. To understand the micro-mechanisms of this enhanced mechanical behavior, Guillen, et al. (Guillen et al., 2018) conducted synchrotron X-ray in situ tensile testing using high energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) to compare the micromechanical evolution of the same PM-HIP and wrought 316L stainless steel and Ni-base Alloy 625 used in the present study. These in situ studies show that mechanical stresses are more homogeneously distributed across grains in PM-HIP materials than in the wrought materials (Guillen et al., 2018). These behaviors are attributed to the sub-melting temperature consolidation, which limits grain growth, thereby producing high yield strengths and toughness associated with finer grain sizes (Atkinson and Davies, 2000, Guillen et al., 2018). The same PM-HIP Ni-base Alloys 625 and 690 studied in the current paper, have also been shown to exhibit greater thermal stability and retain more high-temperature strength than their wrought counterparts, following thermal aging up to 1000 hr at 800 °C (Bullens et al., 2018, Getto et al., 2019).
Few studies have directly compared irradiation effects in HIP (including both solid HIP and PM-HIP) to conventionally fabricated alloys, with the majority of these studies focusing on austenitic stainless steels. Lind and Bergenlid (Lind and Bergenlid, 2000, Lind and Bergenlid, 2001) irradiated PM-HIP and wrought 316LN with neutrons at 290 °C to 2.5 displacements per atom (dpa). Both the PM-HIP and wrought specimens exhibited consistent irradiation-induced increase in yield stress, ductility reduction, and no work hardening. However, after irradiation, the PM-HIP steel had a shorter average low cycle fatigue life and only 30 % the JQ fracture toughness of the wrought steel. These differences in mechanical behaviors were attributed to the oxygen content of the powder used to fabricate the PM-HIP steel. A similar study from ref. (Rodchenkov et al., 2000) compared rolled plate, solid HIP, and PM-HIP 316LN following 265 °C, 10 dpa neutron irradiation. They find that while uniform elongation is similar across all three irradiated specimens, the HIP specimens (solid and PM) undergo greater irradiation hardening, which translates to greater loss of fracture toughness than the rolled plate. Additionally, the rolled plate and PM-HIP specimens exhibit reduced strain hardening capacity after irradiation, although the irradiated solid HIP specimen maintains full strain hardening capacity.
Most recently, the first irradiation effects study on PM-HIP Ni alloys was published by ref. (Clement et al., 2022). The study directly compared PM-HIP to forged alloy 625 under 4.5 Fe2+ ion irradiation to 50 and 100 dpa at 400 °C and 500 °C. They found the density of dislocation-type defects (loops and lines) was consistent in both the PM-HIP and forged specimens at all irradiation conditions. But the ratio of loops to lines varied depending on the initial sink strength, which was higher in forged 625. The higher sink strength delayed dislocation loop growth and unfaulting, but ultimately did not change the total dislocation-type defect density. This microstructural evolution was correlated with nanoindentation hardening.
Work from van Osch, et al. (van Osch et al., 1996) conducted a direct comparison of PM-HIP to rolled plate ferritic/martensitic steel F82H following neutron irradiation in the Petten reactor to 2.5–5 dpa at 300 °C. They found that the irradiated PM-HIP and rolled plate specimens had identical ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), although the PM-HIP specimen experienced a larger irradiation-induced DBTT shift and a reduction in upper shelf energy. A later study conducted 2 dpa neutron irradiation at 200 °C and 300 °C of PM-HIP only (no comparison to cast/forged) precipitation hardened martensitic steel PH13-8Mo (Fe-12Cr-8Ni-2Mo hardened with NiAl precipitates); the irradiation had little effect of on fatigue crack propagation (Jong et al., 2011).

The structural alloys are Ni-base Alloys 625 and 690, Grade 91 ferritic steel, 304L and 316L austenitic stainless steels, and SA508 Grade 3 Class 1 low-alloy RPV steel. All structural alloys except 304L include a PM-HIP and a conventional (cast or forged) version in the irradiation campaign, all of which are provided by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Also included in this experiment are PM-fabricated hafnium-aluminum (HfAl3-Al) neutron absorber alloys, for the purpose of testing these materials at higher temperatures than in previous irradiation experiments (Guillen et al., 2014). The HfAl3-Al alloys have been developed as part of a previous irradiation experiment (Guillen et al., 2010) and are included here since the capsules could accommodate additional specimens. The HfAl3-Al alloys are fabricated by the uniaxial hot pressing of 20.0, 28.4, 36.5 vol% Al3Hf powder in an aluminum matrix.
Three different specimen geometries are used: tensile, miniature compact tension (CT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) discs, as drawn in Fig. 1. Round tensile specimens conform to ASTM E8 standards, with an overall length of 76.2 mm (3 in) and gauge diameter of 6.35 mm (0.25 in). The tensile specimens are machined at INL using computer numerical control (CNC) machining to a surface roughness of 3.2 µm. The miniature CT specimens have dimensions of 10 mm × 9.6 mm × 4 mm, with notch dimensions and 0.53 mm pre-cracks consistent with ASTM E1820. The CT specimens are machined using wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to surface roughness inside holes of 1.6 µm and surface roughness everywhere else of 3.2 µm. The CT machining and pre-cracking is conducted at Dirats Laboratory (Westfield, Massachusetts). Finally, circular TEM discs have a diameter of 3 mm and thickness of 150 µm, except for the HfAl3-Al materials which have a thickness of 300 µm. The TEM discs are prepared at INL using wire EDM cutting with subsequent hand polishing to a mirror finish.

Experiments are designed such that the fabrication methods (PM-HIP versus cast/forged) can be directly compared with respect to microstructure, mechanical property, and fracture behavior across irradiation conditions relevant for each alloy. The experiment matrix provided in Table 3 indicates the number of each specimen geometry – tensile bars, miniature CT specimens, and TEM discs – studied for each alloy at each irradiation condition. For example, irradiation of the Ni-base alloys 625 and 690 and ferritic/martensitic Grade 91 focuses primarily on higher temperatures, considering the temperature ranges for the current and future applications of these alloys in light water reactors (LWRs) and advanced reactors. The Ni-base alloys and Grade 91 matrices also include specimens that facilitate comprehensive microstructure, mechanical, and fracture assessment across both the PM-HIP and cast/forged materials. On the other hand, the SA508 specimens are irradiated at the lowest doses and temperatures, considering the typical operating envelope for pressure vessel steels. In total, 256 specimens are irradiated, which consist of 48 round tensile bars, 28 miniature CTs, and 180 TEM discs.

3.2. Capsule and fixture design
The experiment is configured without instrumented leads using drop-in capsules wherein the specimens are encapsulated inside of a pressure boundary capsule. The capsule acts as a robust barrier between the primary reactor coolant and the specimens. Each test train (or assembly) contains one or two capsules, which are sealed containers that hold fixtures containing the specimens. The test trains and the seven capsules contained within are detailed in Table 4, and the arrangement of capsules within test trains is illustrated in Fig. 2. Each capsule has a unique identifier and contains a specified number of each type of specimens. The fixtures within the capsules are made of aluminum and are held together with stainless steel rings that center the fixture within the capsule (i.e., Marcel expanders), as shown by the cross-sections in Section A-A and Section B-B. Details of each capsule, including the ATR positions and cycle numbers, are provided in Table 4.

Fig. 2. Capsule arrangement within test trains; all dimensions in inches.

There are two capsules each for three target irradiation conditions (300⁰C, 1 dpa; 400⁰C, 1 dpa; and 400⁰C, 3 dpa) and one capsule for one target irradiation condition (300 °C, 3 dpa), for a total of seven capsules. However, the 300 °C, 1 dpa and 400 °C, 1 dpa capsules are combined into two experiment assemblies for a total of five different assemblies. To distinguish between the two capsules of the same target irradiation condition, an “X” or “Y” designator is assigned. Thus, the seven capsules are referred to as 300 °C 1 dpa X, 300 °C 1 dpa Y, 400 °C 1 dpa X, 400 °C 1 dpa Y, 400 °C 3 dpa X, 400 °C 3 dpa Y, and 300 °C 3 dpa. The five experiment assemblies are referred to as 400 °C/300 °C 1 dpa X, 400 °C/300 °C 1 dpa Y, 400 °C 3 dpa X, 400 °C 3 dpa Y, and 300 °C 3 dpa.
The seven-capsule design is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The capsules are irradiated in the inboard A positions in ATR, Fig. 3(b), which are some of the smallest diameter positions in the ATR. Hence, the PM-HIP specimens cannot be stacked pairwise adjacent to their cast/forged counterpart. Rather, all specimens are stacked vertically. Due to the cosine-shaped axial profile of the reactor power density and temperature, it is possible to locate the PM-HIP and cast/forged specimen “pairs” at corresponding elevations above and below the core centerline to mirror fluences and facilitate a meaningful comparison between specimen fabrication types.

The capsules consist of center fixtures and tensile specimen fixtures, the arrangement of which are shown within a 300 °C, 1 dpa capsule in Fig. 3(c). Each center fixture contains CT specimens, monitoring instrumentation, and sometimes TEM specimens, shown in a cutaway view in Fig. 4(a). In the center fixtures that do not contain TEM specimens, a stainless steel block fills the open slot to minimize thermal gradients. The tensile specimen fixtures hold only a single round tensile specimen, Fig. 4(b).

All of the experiment hardware is fabricated at INL. Capsules are fabricated from stainless steel using CNC and EDM machining. The standard inner diameter (ID) of the tubing purchased to fabricate the capsules is the incorrect ID needed to maintain the desired gas gaps. For ease of fabrication, the ID is honed to the desired diameter. But because the honing process is only precise for tube lengths up to ∼ 35.6 cm (14 in), all longer capsules (per Fig. 3(a)) are machined in shorter lengths and welded together.
Physics, thermal, and structural analyses are conducted during the design phase to ensure both temperature and dpa requirements could be met with the proposed design of the experiment. Comprehensive details of these calculations are available in refs. (Brookman, 2018, Hale, 2018). The general purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code MCNP5 release 1.40 (X-5 MCNP Team, 2005, MCNP Team, 2005) is used to model and evaluate the neutron and photon heating, the axial fission profile in the ATR driver fuel, the reactivity worth (ρ$) of the experiment test assembly relative to water-filled inner A positions, and the reactivity worth (ρ$) of a possible backup experiment relative to the water-filled inner A positions. ORIGEN version 2.2 (Croff, 1983) is used to evaluate radiological source terms of the capsules.
Thermal evaluation at nominal operating conditions specific to each experiment assembly is performed using ABAQUS version 6.14–2 (Standard, 2014). ABAQUS has been validated for thermal analysis of ATR experiments by solving several textbook test problems and verifying the results against analytical solutions. The temperature targets for the specimens are 300 °C and 400 °C with a ± 50 °C tolerance. All specimens are predicted to be within ± 39 °C tolerance. To maintain irradiation temperature within ± 50 °C, dimensional tolerances of 0.0254 mm (0.001 in) are required for all specimens to maintain the gas gaps surrounding each specimen. Precision gas-filled gaps between the capsule inner wall and fixtures create thermal resistance necessary to achieve target specimen temperatures. Specimen temperature is more sensitive to gas gap changes for smaller nominal gas gaps. Specifically, a 0.0254 mm incremental increase in nominal gas gaps of 0.635, 0.508, and 0.381 mm, is calculated to increase the specimen temperatures by 10, 13, and 16 °C, respectively. Additionally, sensitivity studies show that a 1 MW change in reactor power could increase specimen temperatures up to 13⁰C.
Custom melt wires are fabricated and encapsulated in quartz at the High Temperature Testing Laboratory at INL. These melt wires are inserted into the center fixtures of each capsule and are evaluated as part of the post-irradiation examination (PIE). The seven capsules are assembled over the course of a week in April 2018. The center fixtures are loaded first with the TEM discs and CT specimens. The tensile bars are then assembled into stainless steel sleeves and affixed to each end of the center fixture. Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the assembly of the center fixtures. After assembly is complete, the capsules are pressurized with a capsule specific He/Ar gas to maintain temperatures (see Table 4), then laser welded shut using weep holes. A plug weld is used to seal the capsules after they are backfilled with the appropriate gas mixture. For conservatism and to allow for variability during assembly, capsules are designed for a minimum weld penetration depth of 0.381 mm, which is less than the minimum penetration depth of 0.635 mm achieved during weld mock-up testing. Pressure testing and final quality inspections are performed prior to ATR insertion.

Structural evaluation of the capsules is performed at a design temperature of 260 °C, an external design pressure of 26.5 atm, and an internal design pressure of 16.0 atm, using ASME BPVC Section III, Class 3 (Boiler and Section, 2010) as a guide. All evaluations are performed using the Service Level B flow coast down thermal loads and the Service Level C pressure loads, in comparison to the design allowable stress values. Using this approach, the minimum required wall thickness criteria of the capsules based on external and internal pressure is 0.635 mm and 0.076 mm, respectively; the nominal wall thickness exceeds the minimum required wall thickness criteria for both internal and external pressure. The axial compressive stress in the capsule is evaluated and is determined to have a design factor of 4.9 (design factor is defined as the ratio of allowable stress to actual stress and must be ≥ 1). Thermal stress is also evaluated in the capsule wall using ASME BPVC Section III, Class 1 methods.
Deflection of the experiment assembly due to flow induced vibration is evaluated and found to not compromise the structural integrity of the assembly. The maximum calculated deflection is deemed impossible to reach in practice, due to the extruded ridges along the capsule extensions and the standoffs machined into the capsules. Stresses in the capsule wall are also calculated due to alternative machining methods; the minimum wall thickness due to internal pressure is 0.102 mm and the minimum design factor due to external pressure is 2.1. Safety compliance thermal analysis is performed to evaluate the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) and flow instability ratio (FIR) for the pump coast down event during a postulated loss of commercial power accident at 34 MW indicated source power with an additional 8.5 % for instrument uncertainty. The DNBR is the ratio of the critical heat flux to the maximum surface heat flux, while the FIR is the ratio of the difference between the saturation temperature at the outlet pressure and the inlet temperature to the difference between the outlet and inlet coolant temperatures. The calculated minimum DNBR is 4.8 and the minimum FIR is 2.15, both exceeding the minimum required values of 2.
3.3. Irradiation cycles and as-run neutronic and thermal estimates
Irradiation is performed during four ATR cycles 164A, 164B, 166A and 166B, with initial capsule insertion on May 9, 2018, cycle 164A beginning on June 11, 2018, and cycle 166B concluding on January 10, 2020. The capsules are irradiated in three inboard A positions in ATR, specifically the A-6, A-7, and A-8 positions. Four capsules with a target fluence of 1 dpa occupied the A-7 and A-8 test positions during ATR cycle 164A. These capsules are removed after one cycle of irradiation, and three different capsules are loaded in the A-6, A-7, and A-8 test positions beginning in ATR cycle 164B to reach a minimum target fluence of 3 dpa. The capsules are not irradiated during the powered axial locator mechanism (PALM) operating cycle that occurs between cycles 164B and 166A.
The ATR operation spans 54.9 effective full power days (EFPD) in cycle 164A, 64.1 EFPD in cycle 164B, 62.5 EFPD in cycle 166A, and 61.2 EFPD in cycle 166B. Reactor power is 19.7 MW in cycle 164B, 21.9 MW in cycle 166A, and 22.1 MW in cycle 166B. MCNP5 release 1.60 (X-5 MCNP Team, 2005, Brown et al., 2010) is used to estimate the average total damage (in dpa) of the specimens. The dpa rate is estimated using a tally multiplier card with a standard flux tally in MCNP5. The neutron flux is calculated as a function of energy on a given material, then it is combined with the dpa cross-section. Microscopic dpa cross-section data is produced using NJOY (MacFarlane and Muir, 2002) nuclear data processing code, which leverages a database of physical nuclear interactions. The NJOY code is widely regarded for its accuracy and relevance for nuclear collisions in the 0–20 MeV range (i.e., LWRs) (Rose, (BNL-NCS 17541), 1996.). The damage cross-section is generated using the HEATR function within NJOY99, which incorporates heat production (kerma) and dpa cross-sections (Chadwick et al., 2006). An atomic displacement energy of 40 eV is applied to all specimens and capsule materials, except for the HfAl3-Al specimens. For the HfAl3-Al specimens, the cutoff energies are determined by an elemental weighted average to be 32.7 eV, 34.5 eV, and 36.0 eV for the 20, 28.4, and 36.5 vol% materials, respectively. Comprehensive details of the as-run dpa calculation are provided in ref. (Brookman, 2020). The estimated average doses are 0.96 and 1.03 dpa for the A7 and A8 positions, respectively, during Cycle 164A. Estimated average doses over cycles 164B, 166A, and 166B are 4.65, 4.32, and 3.97 dpa in the A6, A7, and A8 positions, respectively. For the target 1 dpa specimens, actual doses range 0.5–1.1 dpa, with average dose of 0.9 ± 0.2 dpa. For the target 3 dpa specimens, actual doses range 2.7–5.4 dpa, with an average dose of 3.9 ± 0.5 dpa. The as-run doses for each individual specimen are given in Table 5.
Table 5. Comprehensive list of all specimens and their as-run doses and temperatures. As-run average temperatures were averaged over the specimen and across the TEM stacks. Values for the specimens irradiated to 3 dpa were averaged across the three irradiation cycles.

An as-run finite-element analysis was performed using ABAQUS to determine the maximum and average temperatures experienced by the specimens during irradiation. Nominal design values for the gas gaps and dimensions are used since as-built data is not available. The target 300 °C specimens experienced a temperature range of 257–306 °C, with average temperature 277 ± 10 °C. The target 400 °C specimens experienced a temperature range of 321–398 °C, with average temperature 369 ± 20 °C. The as-run temperatures for each individual specimen are given in Table 5. The average and maximum as-run temperatures listed are averaged over all the cycles for which the specimen was irradiated. Comprehensive details of the as-run thermal analysis and melt wire analysis are provided in refs. (Hale, 2021, Davis and Hone, 2020).
4. Future work
Ongoing and future work consists of PIE of the irradiated structural materials, which includes visual inspection, microstructural examination, and mechanical testing. Mechanical testing will include uniaxial tensile testing of the irradiated tensile bars, fracture testing of the miniature CT specimens, and nanoindentation testing of TEM discs. Tensile testing will be performed at room temperature to obtain stress–strain curves to determine the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, and elongation at failure for each specimen. The tensile tests will be conducted on a remotely operated Instron 5869 load frame at the INL HFEF Main Cell, Window 13 M. Tensile fracture surfaces will be characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at HFEF, to qualitatively determine failure mode (Clement et al., 2022). Fracture toughness testing is intended to be conducted using a remotely operated load cell at the Westinghouse Churchill Site hot cells. Nanoindentation testing will be conducted using a Hysitron TI-950 Triboindenter at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES).
TEM disc specimens slated for microstructural characterization will be decontaminated, mechanically polished, and electropolished after irradiation. Dual-beam SEM-focused ion beam (FIB) will be used to extract TEM lamellae and atom probe tomography (APT) needles. The TEM characterization will include dislocation line density, dislocation loop and void size distributions and number densities, precipitate identification, and measurement of radiation-induced segregation (RIS), using an FEI Tecnai TF30-FEG STwin TEM at CAES. The APT characterization will be conducted using a CAMECA local electrode atom probe (LEAP) 4000X HR at CAES to identify the composition and morphologies of nanoprecipitates, and any microchemical segregation to features such as loops, dislocations, and grain boundaries.
For the HfAl3-Al specimens, TEM examinations will examine the phase boundary between the HfAl3 intermetallic particles and the Al matrix material. Microstructure characterization will confirm whether these higher temperatures effectively anneal the defects generated in the materials irradiated at lower temperatures < 100⁰C. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element maps will be obtained to examine the coherency, number density, and size distribution of the HfAl3 particles. This work will provide a comprehensive, high spatial resolution characterization of the microstructural and chemical inhomogeneities at the interfaces of Al matrix and HfAl3 particles. PIE of the HfAl3-Al specimens will be performed under an NSUF Rapid Turnaround Experiment.
5. Summary
We have presented an ATR neutron irradiation experiment design that can be used as a template for future nuclear materials qualification efforts, with considerations for accommodating ASTM standard-sized mechanical testing specimens, designing for consistent fluence and temperature across specimen groups, and planning for comprehensive PIE. This experiment was designed to compare the irradiation response of PM-HIP alloys and their conventionally fabricated cast or forged counterparts irradiated at target doses of 1 and 3 dpa and target temperatures of 300⁰C and 400⁰C. Six nuclear structural alloys are studied: two Ni-based alloys, a ferritic steel, a low-alloy steel, and two austenitic stainless steels, as well as HfAl3-Al alloys in three different HfAl3 weight percentages (20, 28.4 and 36 wt%). Both the PM-HIP and cast/forged versions of each alloy were irradiated under nearly identical dose and temperature conditions, and PIE will be conducted using the same equipment and techniques to ensure consistency in the comparison. The experiment design allows for the elucidation of the microstructure-mechanical property relationships in irradiated PM-HIP alloys, including the role of phenomena such as loop and void nucleation, phase stability, and radiation-induced segregation on hardening, embrittlement, and fracture toughness. PIE data from this experiment will inform the in-service behavior of key nuclear structural alloys at LWR and advanced reactor relevant temperatures and irradiation doses. Upon project completion, specimens will enter the NSUF library (Cole, 2015) to be made available to the research community for follow-on investigations.
