1. Introduction
Electric vehicles (EVs) could be generally classified into fuel cell electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles. As for EVs, lower operating cost is the key benefit, whereas a major challenge for their market spread is thermal problems related to batteries. The thermal management systems of battery-based EVs consist mainly of three components: battery thermal management system (BTMS), motor thermal management system (MTMS), and cabin thermal management system (CTMS). BTMS components could work separately or by integration with other thermal management systems for the sake of multi-component optimization [1]. The demand for EVs will increase by 15 % in 10 years to become 30 % of the total vehicles in 2030 instead of 15 % in 2020 [2].
EV history begins with the first invented EV in 1834. Afterwards, EVs worked along with steam and internal combustion engines (ICEs) based vehicles due to their low noise and vibration despite their low efficiency. In 1930, the EV market share was almost plumped due to oil discoveries and ICE breakthroughs in vibration and noise [3]. In 1899, Nickel metal batteries evolved with high energy densities followed by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 1977 which triggered battery usage in EVs [4]. In 1997, the hybrid vehicles market evolved relying on high energy–density batteries to enhance ICE efficiency [5]. In 2008, the first recent pure EV was announced to the market by Tesla with a 245-mile range based on one charge [6]. Nowadays, recent EVs have a large range of about 500-mile per charge and are deeply researched to increase their market share to 31 % by 2050 [7].
Although there were previous reviews about electric vehicles’ battery thermal management, most reviews focused on battery modelling [8], [9], [10] and temperature effects [11], [12] besides the conventional and revolutionary surface thermal management techniques [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], and internal cooling [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, recently other nonconventional techniques emerged and proved to have some potential such as tab thermal management. Moreover, the proposed performance parameters were not comprehensively handled for a detailed overview. In this review, conventional and emerging battery design forms are discussed to evaluate the progress in the proposed forms according to BTMSs. An overview of different thermal characteristics and thermal management objectives are declared for the sake of a comprehensive assessment of different design and performance parameters. In addition to that, conventional temperature-based and recently proposed heat rate-based performance parameters are compared for the assessment of LIBs’ thermal characteristics. Afterwards, a comprehensive review of BTMS objectives is generally declared and then focused on cooling methods. Conventional cooling methods such as internal cooling and external surface side and edge cooling were illustrated with a deep demonstration of revolutionary external tab cooling methods.
2. EV battery components and operating principles
2.1. Battery materials
There are different materials used for building batteries and provides a comprehensive comparison between different common and revolutionary types as shown in Table 1. However, the most common material for batteries used in EVs is lithium. Therefore, Table 2 provides a deep comparison between different kinds of LIBs. LIBs are the most common dry battery due to their high energy density, capacity, charge/discharge capability, efficiency, and reliability [23]. Fortunately, the proposed battery materials represent promising candidates for thermal performance issues encountered by typical materials. On the other hand, Li-ion batteries should work under an optimal temperature range and optimal charge/discharge rate for delayed degradation. Typically, the average battery C-rates are 1 to 1.5C and the peak C-rates are 3 to 4C, whereas the extremely fast rate is 6C [24].

2.2. Construction and operation principles of LIBs
Batteries have various components, operation principles and phenomena which should be properly defined to recognize their interactions for the development of an effective BTMS. Li-ion cells are constructed of five main components: graphite anode (the negative terminal/pole), lithium metal oxide cathode (the positive terminal/pole), separator, electrolyte, and current collectors. The common materials for the cathode are lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganate, and lithium nickel cobalt manganate while the most common materials of the anode are graphite and silicon alloys [25]. The separator/diaphragm is placed between the electrodes and its objective is to allow ions to transfer without electrical contact between the electrodes. The common materials for the separator are polyethylene, single-layer polypropylene, and three-layer polypropylene-polyethylene-polypropylene septum [25].
The electrolyte is a solution of non-aqueous lithium-containing salts as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) and organic liquid mixture solvents such as methyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and propylene carbonate [8]. The electrolyte exists within both the anode and the cathode to promote ionic conduction [26]. The electrode provides electrons to the current collector to be transported to the external circuit for current flow [15]. The charging and discharging process is characterized by the lithium ions and electrons transfer in ionization and oxidation processes [27]. Typically, there is a copper current collector at the anode side and an aluminum current collector at the cathode side. This choice of copper and aluminum at certain electrodes is due to the electro-potential of copper and the mechanical stability of aluminum. Current collectors are regarded as inactive during operation as they do not contribute to cell capacity [28]. The cathode, anode, and total electrochemical reduction–oxidation (redox) reactions associated with LIBs are as follows [29];

Fig. 1. Electrons and Li-ions flow during (a) discharging and (b) charging.

During charging in Li-Ion batteries, electrons move from the metal oxide cathode to the graphite anode through the external power source as the separator prevents the electron flow, whereas the lithium ions tend to move from the metal oxide cathode to the graphite anode through the separator. For charged batteries, the anode acts as a storage medium for ions and electrons. As for discharge, the electrons move through the external load from the anode to the cathode and the lithium ions are transferred from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. The driving force of the discharge process is the high electrochemical potential [25].
For a system to be in equilibrium, the electrochemical potential (which is the sum of the chemical potential and the electrostatic energy) is conserved and the system is unable to move the species (molecules, ions, and electrons) to lower its total free energy. Equilibrium potential or open circuit voltage (OCV) is the maximum cell potential when reversible operation is achieved. Closed circuit voltage (CCV) or actual potential is lower than OCV due to overpotentials [42]. Overpotential/overvoltage/polarization is the required deviation from the equilibrium potential to flow a specific current density through the electrodes. Overpotential has an inverse relationship with the efficiency of the battery as an energy storage system. There are three types of overpotentials: ohmic overpotential, activation overpotential, and concentration overpotential as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. A discharge curve demonstrating different types of overpotentials.

Ohmic/resistance overpotential or IR drop is the potential deviation due to internal resistance which is the electronic resistance of the cell components and the ionic resistance of the electrolyte. Ohmic overpotential effects are active during the whole charge/discharge process and are significant at the beginning of charge/discharge leading to a sudden drop in voltage. Activation/kinetic overpotential represents the energy barrier to activate the chemical reaction and is dominant at the beginning of charge/discharge. Reaction overpotential is a type of activation overpotential and represents the contribution of a slow chemical reaction in a quick charge transfer process.
Finally, concertation/mass transfer overpotential represents the decrease in the reactants concentrations or the limited mass transport capabilities due to limited diffusion or bubble formations and is dominant at the end of charge/discharge [43]. Lithium plating is a metallic lithium deposition on the anode surface because the ions diffusion rate is higher than the optimum ions intercalation rate in the anode. Diffusion rate deficiency is triggered at low-temperature operation and high charging rates leading to lithium loss, dendrite formation, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) reformation [44]. A dendrite is a kind of plating forming treelike branching which leads to the perforation of the separator which could cause short circuits leading to thermal runaway [45].
The SEI layer is a passive layer formed by the reaction of lithium ions and the electrolyte at the graphite surface utilizing lithium ions. During the first cycle by the manufacturer, the battery capacity is permanently reduced by 10 % due to the lithium depletion in the SEI [46]. After the formation of SEI, the thermodynamically unstable graphite is kinetically protected against the electrolyte which makes the battery reversible and elongates the battery life. SEI layer is an ionically conductive but electronically insulative layer which stops the reactions between the anode and the electrolyte paving the way for an easy operation for the electrochemical processes to occur [47]. Thermal runaway occurs when elevated temperature triggers accelerated exothermic reactions. For temperatures between 90 °C and 120 °C, the SEI metastable components start to exothermically decompose. At 143 °C, the separator starts to melt which makes the anode and the cathode in electrical contact and short-circuits occur. At temperatures higher than 150 °C, thermal runaway finally happens [48].
The internal resistance of the battery has three main contributors: bulk resistance, charge-transfer resistance, and solid-state interface resistance. Bulk resistance reflects the electric conductivities of electrodes, separators, and the electrolyte. Solid-state interface resistance denotes the electrode surface resistance due to the interface layers, whereas charge-transfer resistance represents the resistance associated with faradaic charge-transfer. The charge-transfer resistance is larger in empty batteries than in partially charged ones and that is why the charging process requires more treatment than the discharging process especially in low-temperature environments [49]. For battery life extension, it’s recommended to work at a medium state of charge (SoC) range of 20:80 % [50]. As for out of this optimum SoC range, profound structural changes occur for anode and cathode materials along with side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte resulting in higher polarization impedance which increases the capacity fade and decreases the battery life [51].
2.3. Design forms of LIBs
A battery is an energy conversion device between chemical and electrical energy. A battery cell is the smallest unit that can work on its own. As for battery collections, a battery module is a cell assembly supported by a mechanical structure for protection against external heat, shocks, and vibrations, whereas a battery pack is a module assembly integrated with control/protection systems such as battery management systems (BMSs) and BTMSs as shown in Fig. 3. Large format cells with large capacity and energy density are desirable. However, large format cells have high internal heat generation leading to increased degradation and overheating [52].

Fig. 3. Li-Ion battery configurations of (a) cell, (b) module, and (c) pack.

There are three main design forms: cylindrical, pouch/laminate, and prismatic/rectangular cell types as shown in Fig. 4. Cylindrical cells are constructed by wrapping strips of the cathode, separator, and anode sheets and then inserting the wrap in a rigid aluminum or stainless-steel casing. Cylindrical cells have a higher energy density compared with prismatic and pouch cells. On the other hand, their packing efficiency is low which decreases the overall energy density of the pack. Typical formats are 14500, 18650, and 26,650 (26 represents a diameter of 26 mm, 65 represents a 65 mm height, and 0 is a code for cylindrical cells). Pouch cells are rectangular-shaped cells made by stacking cathode, separator, and anode layers into a pouch and filling with electrolyte then sealing and putting the terminals outside the pouch. The casing is made of laminated flexible polymers which facilitate the reduction of cost, thickness, and weight. Packing efficiency is high due to their flat and soft body with a range of 90:95 %. Prismatic cells are generally constructed by rolling stacks of cathode, separator, and anode layers and then flattening to have a rectangular shape. The energy density of the prismatic cells is slightly lower than cylindrical cells because of their thicker size, but with high packing efficiency [30].

In addition to the basic conventional design forms, there are revolutionary design forms as structural and blade batteries as illustrated in Table 3. Structural batteries generally use composite materials as reinforced carbon fibers to serve for energy storage and as a structure, as well. Structural batteries are also called massless batteries due to the overall reduced mass considering the double functions of the structural batteries. Blade batteries are considered revolutionary prismatic cells with much greater length and capacity besides the elimination of the fire and smoke hazards resulting from thermal runaway even in harsh conditions [53]. Both blade and structural batteries are connected directly through cell-to-pack format due to their special characteristics and large capacity. The elimination of modules allows for better thermal performance because of larger distances between cells and larger surface areas.

Tab-less (all-tab/continuous tab) batteries are revolutionary electric connections used especially for cylindrical cells to allow for large capacities and large volumes as used in 4680 Panasonic/Tesla cells [54], [55]. For the 4680 T cell, The improvement in thermal and electrical performance is due to the reduction in electrical and thermal paths besides the reduced thermal contact resistances between the metal can and the jellyroll for both tabs [52]. The new design forms pave the way to target superb thermal performance using efficient thermal management systems, especially tab cooling.
3. Libs thermal characteristics
The thermal behavior of the Li-ion batteries varies significantly during charge and discharge cycles [56]. This section demonstrates a basic understanding of this thermal behavior and its characteristics.
3.1. Thermal conductivity and heat capacity
The most significant thermal properties of the LIBs are thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. The battery composition is crucial to investigate the related thermal properties. LIBs are composed of layered structures in which each layer contains one anode, one separator, one cathode, and two current collectors. Each layer in the layered structure has a thickness of less than 100 µm. The battery fabrication is done by stacking or winding the basic units about a center axis [32].
Thermal conductivity is treated as anisotropic due to the layered structure of LIBs. LIBs layers contain copper and aluminum current collectors with high thermal conductivity. Therefore, thermal conductivity is high in the in-plane direction as heat transfer occurs along layers in parallel. On the other hand, thermal conductivity is low along the through-plane direction as heat transfer occurs through layers in series [57]. For simplicity, LIBs are treated as one layer when modelling thermal conductivity due to the tiny thickness and the large numbers of layers [58]. The thermal conductivity for parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular (through-plane) directions could be calculated as follows [59];
(4)
(5)
Where 
 is the thickness of the corresponding component. Nada et al. [60] found that the thermal contact resistance between layers contributed by 88 % of the total resistance, that is why the above equation gave huge discrepancies when compared with experimental measurements. Xie et al. [57] utilized the transient plane source method to estimate the orthotropic thermal conductivity for a 27Ah cell at various discharge rates. Results revealed that the optimum discharge rate for estimation is 3C and the maximum relative error is 89.9 %. Further enhancement in prediction accuracy could be reached using suitable thresholds for the thermal conductivity error sets. The following are some typical values for orthotropic thermal conductivities; 
 and 
 [61]. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of different battery materials are 
 [60], 
 [62], and thermal conductance typical values for the contact interface between case and separator is 395:945 
 [63].
Accurate thermal conductivity values through experiments are still difficult and theoretical calculations are still used. It’s worth-noticing that thermal conductivities for basic battery types (pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical) are different due to the different mechanism of layers gathering [32]. Waldmann et al. [59] demonstrated that in-plane thermal gradients are larger for pouch cells and smaller for cylindrical cells compared with the through-plane thermal gradients. Therefore, aging gradients are larger in the in-plane direction for pouch cells and in the through-plane direction for cylindrical cells due to combined effect of thermal conductivity and heat accumulation.
Specific heat capacity is evaluated through experimental measurements using accelerated rate calorimetry ARC. In the experimental setup a flexible heater is placed between multiple batteries uniformly arranged around it. The arrangement is insulated from its exterior to ensure that all the heating power from the flexible heater is totally and uniformly distributed in batteries. The heat capacity could then be evaluated through the following equation [64];
(6)
Where 
 is the specific heat, 
 is the heating power, m is the battery mass, and 
 is the temperature change rate.
3.2. Heat generation rate
The heat balance of the battery could be represented as follows [65], [66];
(7)
where the left-hand side term represents the transient temperature change. The first term on the right-hand side is the spatial conduction term, the second term is the internal heat generation from the battery, and the last term is the external heat transfer (battery heating/cooling) [32].
Battery heat generation could be classified into three main components; (a) battery entropy change from electrochemical and side reactions, (b) polarization losses (ohmic, activation, and concentration polarizations), and (c) mixing process within battery relaxation [67]. Concentration variation within the battery exists due to the nonuniform reaction rates. After the current cut-off, the concentration gradients relax, and heat is added/rejected depending on the battery operation. When the battery is reused, the concentration gradient will reproduce and heat will be rejected/added with the same amount, but with opposite direction which is what is called mixing heat production.
Therefore, the battery heat generation could be determined as follows;
(8)
The first term is irreversible Joule heating, the second one is reversible heating due to reaction entropy change, the third term is heating according to side reaction, and the last one is heating resulting from the mixing process. As for small format batteries working at a constant current without profound degradation, the heating due to side reactions and mixing process could be ignored then the equation is simplified to the flowing equation [68].
(9)
Heat generation is dependent on the ageing process due to the increased internal resistance to ageing [69], [70]. The heat generation is generally estimated by both numerical and experimental methods and the typical values of heat generation rates are 2:25 % of the total cell power. The numerical method advantage is the ability to estimate irreversible Joule heating and reversible heating individually. The most common model is the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model proposed by Thomas and Newman [71]. In the P2D model, the irreversible heat generation is evaluated by the determination of battery polarization. Current (I) and entropy heat coefficient (
) are comprised of reversible heat, whereas OCV (U) and CCV (V) besides I are included in the Joule heating term. The SoC is used to determine the entropy heat coefficient. The SoC is commonly obtained by experimental measurements as it depends on battery chemistries [72].
On the other hand, the most common experimental methods include accelerated rate calorimetry (ARC) and isothermal heat conduction calorimetry (IHC). ARC simulates an adiabatic condition to measure the heat generation rate, the exothermic process enthalpy, and the reaction onset temperature [73], whereas IHC is used to identify the thermal stability related to the battery material and the heat generation rate [74]. The difference between ARC and IHC is that the heat generation rate evaluated in ARC is while increasing the battery temperature, but it is for a certain battery temperature when using IHC [73]. The heat generation rate is dependent on material properties, thermodynamics, and chemical kinetics. Therefore, the heat generation rate is different in the battery components such as; positive and negative electrodes and separators [32]. Zhang [75] thermally analyzed a cylindrical cell and found that Joule heating, electrochemical reaction, and active polarization contribute 54 %, 30 %, and 16 %, respectively to the total heat generation.
3.3. Operating temperature effects
3.3.1. Low-temperature effect
Low temperatures for LIBs slow the chemical reactions and species transfer and reduce electrode ion diffusivity and electrolyte conductivity. As a result, performance is reduced in the form of an increase in the battery's internal resistance and polarization at electrode surfaces. Internal resistance will increase due to the ionic conductivity reduction resulting from the increase in electrolyte viscosity which is inversely proportional to temperature. Modified electrolytes with better internal resistance properties were proposed to enlarge the optimal working temperature. Power and energy produced by batteries are about to vanish when working at temperatures below −20 °C [76].
Zhang et al. [77] found that decreasing the battery temperature from 20 °C to −20 °C would raise the battery's internal resistance by 10 times. Stored energy and power output from the battery are reduced as a result of the slowed species transfer and the accelerated lithium deposition on the anode during charging [78]. It was also found that only 12 % of the available capacity is obtained at −40 °C compared to room temperature. Charging the battery at low temperature would trigger lithium plating due to the prevention of the lithium intercalation between the anode and the electrolyte which increases lithium-ions loss and consequently capacity fade [79]. Therefore, the preheating of the battery before usage is crucial for extended reliability [32]. Thermal runaway could happen at low temperatures due to the dendrite formation as a result of deposited lithium metal which causes an internal short-circuit [32]. Thermal runaway could also happen due to certain exothermic reactions that reach their peak at low temperatures as reported by Feng et al. [80]. Henke and Hailu [81] found that discharging cells at temperatures lower than the optimum temperature range greatly reduces capacity in shorter times for a single discharge procedure compared to working at optimum temperatures as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Capacity reduction at 3C of discharge at different temperatures [81].

3.3.2. High-temperature effect
At high operational temperatures, the performance of LIBs is reduced in the form of reduced voltage and battery life along with increased internal resistance. It was found that working at 55 °C for 100 cycles reduced the battery capacity by 70 %. High temperatures also lead to a rapid increase in the SEI on the electrode surface leading to reduced power and capacity and increased impedance [82]. High temperatures could also increase the probability of thermal runaway due to the triggering of the exothermic reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes which release heat that further increases the temperature leading to a further increase in the exothermic reactions. This process happens in a short time raising the probability of explosions [83]. Thermal runaway stages could be associated with high temperatures as follows; at 90 °C, the cathode coating started to decompose. At 100 °C, irreparable damage and melting occur at best scenarios and in the worst case the battery bursts. At 143 °C, separator melting, and contraction occur. At 150 °C, fire and explosions occur and the released toxic gases could produce severe risk to individuals [11], [48].
3.3.3. Optimum temperature range (OTR)
For LIBs, the optimum operational temperature range is 15–35 °C [84] with a wider acceptable range of −20:60 °C [24]. The thermal gradient in the cell either length-wise or thickness-wise and in the battery pack either cell-to-cell or module-to-module is optimized to be eliminated and is acceptable to be below 5 °C [85], whereas the optimum storage temperature for LIBs is at 15 °C with a wider optimum range of 0:30 °C [86] and a wider acceptable range of −40:50 °C [87].

3.3.4.1. Thermal runaway
In addition to undesirable operational temperature, thermal runaway could also occur due to electrical abuse such as external short circuits, over-charge, and over-discharge [89] along with mechanical abuse such as crashes and penetrations [90]. The electrical and mechanical abuse result in separator penetration that causes an internal short circuit leading to abnormal Joule heating which tremendously raises the battery temperature and finally triggers the thermal runaway [32].
Thermal runaway could be prevented using two methods: changing battery materials, and special thermal management systems. As for battery materials, the main purpose of implementing new materials is to hinder the chain reactions associated with thermal runaway propagation. Coating of the cathode is the most common method to improve the cathode's thermal stability against thermal runaway [32]. Common materials used for coating are phosphates, solid oxides, and fluorides [91]. Cho [91] proposed using AlPO4 coating layers on LiCoO2 cathode. The oven test showed stability of the cathode during overcharge.
Furthermore, special thermal management systems are also utilized to prevent thermal runaway. The most common methods are the integration of composite phase change materials (PCMs), metallic plates and microchannels for the sake of high heat dissipation rate capability [92], [93], [94]. Srivastava et al. [95] investigated the management of thermal runaway by using PCMs by changing different design parameters such as ambient temperature, PCM thickness, charging/discharging rates, and PCM types. Eicosane showed better thermal performance with maximum temperature control at 40 °C. Results also revealed that the PCM thickness has a limit where the thermal performance is approximately unaltered beyond. Garcia et al. [96] investigated the use of indirect-contact liquid cooling using water glycol flowing through macro-channels integrated into cold plates in contact with a 120-cylindrical-cell module. At 5C-rate, a mass flow rate of 50 g/s could achieve an average temperature of 38 °C and a decrease in temperature difference that is enough to prevent uneven degradation which triggers thermal runaway due to the increased internal resistance in some cells.
Mohammadian et al. [97] utilized the lattice Boltzmann method simulation to verify the efficacy of the micro-channels on thermal runaway mitigation. Results revealed that the incorporation of microchannels inside the electrodes significantly reduces the occurrence of thermal runaway. Xu et al. [98] investigated the use of water mist to prevent thermal runaway for 18,650 cylindrical batteries. Results revealed that water mist provided good thermal control against thermal runaway and when the battery temperature is above the boiling point of water, the water mist cooling system could provide a high-temperature reduction rate of 4:7 °C/s. Kritzer et al. [99] showed that the usage of CO2 as a compressed refrigerant in a pressure vessel without cycling succeeded in emergency cases as a passive thermal runaway prevention system. For a 4Ah cell at 5C over-charge, 50 g of CO2 immediately reduced the battery surface temperature from 90 °C to −45 °C.
3.3.4.2. Battery degradation/ageing
Aging is a complicated phenomenon caused by interconnected factors associated with usage modes such as energy consumption and charging/discharging rate along with working conditions such as ambient temperatures and subjected mechanical stresses [100]. Different kinds of batteries have different aging processes depending on the materials of cathodes and anodes besides the interaction regime of the separator and electrolyte with the electrodes. Battery ageing results in a reduction in energy and power efficiencies and battery lifespan [15]. Intensive research was conducted to understand the ageing mechanisms [101]. In addition to that, further research was done for ageing estimation and modelling [102].
The main performance parameters related to ageing are state of charge, depth of discharge, and state of health along with cycle life, calendar life, and equivalent full cycle. State of charge (SoC) is the amount of the available capacity compared to the nominal capacity [15]. Depth of discharge (DoD) is the amount of the charge removed compared to the nominal capacity and the DoD is related to the SoC as follows; DoD = 100 %-SoC [32], [103]. C-rate, on the other hand, is the ratio of the charge or discharge current to the nominal capacity. State of Power (SoP) is the maximum power that can be charged or discharged steadily during a specified time interval for stable, reliable, and safe operation [104]. State of health (SoH) is an indication of the internal resistance increase [15], [105].
Cycle-life is the number of charge/discharge cycles before the SoC is reduced by 20 %. As to the cycle-life parameter, battery life is reduced mainly due to usage. On the other hand, calendar-life is the retention time of inactive batteries before a SoC reduction by 20 % occurs. As for the calendar-life parameter, battery life is reduced with the active and inactive time immediately after manufacturing [15]. Equivalent full cycle (EFC) is the ratio of the total discharged capacity to the nominal capacity which could be used as a representation of degradation during active and inactive modes [106].
The main performance features related to ageing are capacity fade and power fade. Capacity fade represents the capability reduction to deliver the stored energy with time and usage due to operating conditions such as temperature, current, voltage, load, and charge/discharge rate. Power fade is the power delivery reduction due to the increase in the internal resistance [107]. Kim et al. investigated the effect of temperature on capacity fade and found that discharging 21,700 cylindrical cells at standard discharge rates and −20 °C results in capacity fade comparable to that of discharging at over-discharge rates and 25 °C [108]. Wu et al. [109] investigated a control strategy on a BTMS using online dynamic programming by developing three operational modes of temperature reservation, slow cooling, and fast cooling. The proposed system reduced the degradation rate by 21 % by only consuming 3.15 % of the cell energy compared to the no-cooling system.
3.4. Thermal performance parameters
Conventional heat dissipation performance parameters such as Biot number and thermal conductivity are unsuitable for batteries because of the uneven heat dissipation rate and the anisotropic thermal conductivity. The main reason for this is the uneven electrochemical behaviour resulting from the thermal gradients across a cell. Therefore, special performance parameters were proposed for the BTMS assessment [110], [111].
3.4.1. Temperature-based parameters
The most common thermal performance parameters are the maximum temperature (Tmax), and the maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax). Waldmann et al. [59] illustrated that the maximum temperature has a linear relationship with the C-rate of the discharge for a full discharge cycle and introduced a coefficient of Tmax/C-rate (°C/C) that is dependent on the cell and the ambient condition. 
 is another parameter that represents the average temperature across the surface area (
).
(10)
Furthermore, the uniformity coefficient 
 [112] is used to measure the temperature distribution uniformity and could be expressed as follows;
(11)
Temperature standard deviation is also utilized besides ΔTmax as an indication for uneven thermal distribution across the volume (
) [113].
(12)
3.4.2. Heat rate-based parameters
3.4.2.1. Cell cooling coefficient (CCC)
Cell cooling coefficient (CCC) is a representative of the rate of heat dissipation for a specific cell with a special design and form factor. The CCC (W/K) is calculated by dividing the heat dissipation rate by the temperature difference between the cell's maximum temperature and the cooled surface. The maximum temperature is the temperature of the hot side when single-side surface cooling is adopted [114]. The CCC could be considered as a comparison tool for cell selection based on its thermal performance where a higher value is an indication of a better performance [115]. This parameter is recommended to be reported in battery data sheets along with energy and power densities as a representation of the thermal performance for the credibility of the overall performance, as low thermal performance cells require higher power consumption and higher BTMS weight and volume for packing [116]. The CCC is independent of the BTMS used and is only dependent on the cells. There are CCC for tab cooling (
) and for surface cooling of a single side (
) and of double sides (
) as each cooling method produces a special thermal gradient and therefore a special electrochemical behaviour resulting in a different heat generation behaviour affecting charging/discharging rates and SoC [114].
(13)
Diaz et al. [117] used the same empirical method for measuring the CCC to assess the irreversible heat generation for cells to produce a heat generation map as a function of four parameters; temperature, frequency, current, and SoC. The heat generation maps could be used for BTMS selection based on the cell characteristics and the operational conditions.
Numerous research adopted the CCC for pouch cells. Table 4 provides a deep comparison between the different reported CCC values for different battery design forms. Hales et al. [115] proposed the CCC for tab cooling and reported values for 5Ah and 7.5Ah pouch cells. Afterwards, Hales et al. [118] reported values of CCC for surface cooling for the same cells and found that surface cooling has larger values of CCC compared with tab cooling because of the cell designs that allow larger heat transfer rates for surface compared to tabs. Russel et al. [116] proposed an enhancement in the experimental measurement of the CCC by using better contact control between cells and BTMSs through pressure bars, better insulation for the control of heat loss, and better selection for the thermal control locations. Results revealed large variations that could reach 36 % between the reported values of the CCC compared with the previous estimations.

Hales et al. [119] investigated different cell geometries by the study of five different pouch cells with modifications. Results revealed an enhancement of the surface cooling by the reduction of cell thickness and an enhancement of the tab cooling by 20 % by the increase in tab thickness by 34 % with a decrease in specific energy by only 0.7 %. They also concluded that surface cooling by double sides is 3 times larger than by a single side in terms of the CCC. Furthermore, it was found that the number of layers for a cell has an inverse linear relationship with the CCC for surface cooling. On the other hand, CCC for tab cooling has a direct linear relationship with the number of layers. Therefore, the coefficient of per capacity coefficient (PPC) (W/K.Ah) is introduced by dividing the CCC by the number of layers represented by the beginning of life (BoL) capacity as each layer stores a specific capacity. PCC also demonstrates the capability of the cell to dissipate heat normalized by its capacity.
(14)
The typical range of recent pouch cells for 
 is 0.004:0.06 W/K.Ah and for 
 is 0.6:0.7 W/K.Ah, whereas for recent prismatic cells, 
 has a range of 0.02:0.06 W/K.Ah [52].
 is defined as the ratio of surface to tab cooling cell cooling coefficients which is used to compare surface and tab cooling in terms of degradation and capacity fade rate. This parameter is always greater than one for current cells and low values indicate better performance using tab cooling due to the low thermal gradient such as 3.07 for a 5Ah pouch Kokam cell. On the other hand, high values indicate better performance for surface cooling due to the high overall temperature of the cell induced by tab cooling because of the low heat dissipation rate such as 18.7 for 20Ah pouch A123 cell [120].
(15)
Lander et al. [121] found that for large format pouch batteries, the CCC for surface cooling of the double sides (
) which is similar to immersion cooling and is 3 times more efficient than surface cooling of a single side (
) as emphasized by Hales et al. [119]. Moreover, a proposed optimized BTMS based on surface cooling revealed a reduction in the life cycle cost and carbon footprint by 27 % and 25 %, respectively compared to air cooling. Furthermore, a BTMS based on tab cooling with an optimized cell design demonstrated a decrease in the life cycle cost and carbon footprint by 40 % and 35 %, respectively compared to air cooling.
On the other hand, research is conducted on prismatic cells. Hua et al. [122] investigated a large format of prismatic cells of 90Ah for the determination of the CCC for surface cooling. They found that CCC for surface cooling was 2.04 W/K and 2.18 W/K for experimental and numerical investigations, respectively. Changing the casing from aluminium alloy to pure aluminum was found to increase the CCC for surface cooling by 143 % with a negligible effect on energy density by a reduction of only 0.1 %. It was also found that decreasing the cell thickness from 36.5 mm to 18.36 mm would enhance the CCC of surface cooling by 47 %.
Finally, cylindrical cells were studied for the CCC. Marzook et al. [123] investigated the assessment of the CCC for the cylindrical cells by cooling the cells at their base (negative tab) and defined the 
(
) as the heat rate dissipated divided by the temperature difference between the base and the positive tab. Several parameters are proposed to account for geometrical parameters such as 
 per unit area of the base (
) (W/K.m2) along with the CCC for geometry normalization (
) (W/K.m) which is the 
 multiplied by the heat transfer length and divided by the heat transfer area. Results revealed that 21,700 cells have a larger 
 of 0.139 W/K compared to 0.115 W/K for 18,650 cells. On the other hand, 
 and 
 are lower for 21,700 cells by 13 % and 5 %, respectively compared with 18,650 cells. Furthermore, the 21,700 cells have a larger heat generation rate and thermal gradient along the length compared to 18,650 cells by 250 % and 180 %, respectively.

Where L is the cylindrical cell length for tab cooling and 0.5D for surface cooling depending on the maximum thermal gradient which exists at the other tab when the tab cooled and at the cell center when the surface cooled [52].
Another proposed parameter is CCC normalized to heat generation (
) (W/K.Ah2.Ω) by dividing the 
 by the heat generation rate [52].

Where current is represented by its equivalent of capacity charge/discharge rate and 
 is calculated from the instantaneous voltage drop at the subjected

3.4.2.2. Module cooling coefficient (MCC)
The module cooling coefficient (MCC) is an empirical parameter for battery module thermal performance. MCC (W/K) is evaluated by dividing the heat dissipation rate by the average temperature difference between the proposed BTMS and passive air cooling. MCC is defined by the temperature difference between the average temperatures of the cooled region by a proposed BTMS and by passive air. When active air cooling is proposed, MCC is dependent on the active air conditions as air velocity and charging/discharging rates [110]. MCC is used as a comparison tool for battery module selection based on its thermal performance where a higher value indicates better performance. Wang et al. [125] studied the effect of increasing humidity and air velocity using the MCC for pouch cells. Results revealed that increasing velocity has a higher impact on battery performance. Furthermore, increasing humidity has a significant effect till a relative humidity of 15 % only. Wang et al. [110] studied a forced convection air cooling based BTMS and found that for 2C of discharge and 12 m/s air flow velocity, the maximum temperature is about 43.9 °C and the average value of MCC for cooling by positive and negative tabs could be kept at a range of 0.1:0.2 W/K as illustrated in Table 6.

3.4.2.3. Cooling energy efficiency coefficient (β)
The cooling energy efficiency coefficient (β) is a dimensionless number calculated by dividing the heat rate dissipated (
) from the battery module by the power consumption to a BTMS (
) as an indication for the coefficient of performance (COP). This parameter was proposed for a forced convection air cooling system and for that system it is dependent on the flow passage, cells arrangement and air velocity [126]. For a width to height ratio of the battery module equal to 0.9, β is 5.39 for 1C of discharge and 8 m/s air flow rate, whereas β is 1.98 for 2C of discharge and 12 m/s air flow rate [110]. Lu et al. [126] made a tradeoff between the energy efficiency by the energy efficiency coefficient (β), power density by the factor of space utilization rate (α), and the thermal performance by the maximum temperature. Results revealed that the optimized cooling channel size for 18,650 cylindrical LIBs is 1 mm and the number of rows along the airflow direction is 10 for a staggered arrangement.

Fig. 8. BTMS classification.

4.1. Thermal management objectives
Thermal management objectives are to make the battery in the optimal temperature range with the lowest thermal gradients between different cells in the pack or within the cell itself where thermal gradients normally exist within-layer or between layer-to-layer. The thermal management system is aimed to utilize a minimum mass and volume while consuming a minimum energy and power with the lowest initial and operational costs while providing for continuous, long, and safe operation [127].
4.1.1. Heat rate management
Heat rate management is the thermal power that should be added to the system (heating) or rejected from the system (cooling/refrigeration) [128]. Both cooling and refrigeration systems reduce the temperature, but refrigeration decreases the temperature below the ambient temperature. Refrigeration is used when the ambient temperature is higher than the desired operational temperature or when the ambient temperature is lower than the operational temperature, but the temperature difference, which is the driving force for heat dissipation, is insufficient for the desired heat transfer rate. A refrigerant is a refrigeration system working fluid which undergoes two phase change procedures to facilitate a heat rate. While a coolant may or not undergoes phase change. Both dry and wet bulb temperatures are considered ambient temperature. So, passive evaporative cooling is a cooling not a refrigeration system as the ultimate achieved temperature is the wet bulb temperature. A BTMS is also called temperature control system because the heat rate rejection and addition are provided for a battery to work on the optimal temperature conditions.
4.1.2. Thermal gradient management
Thermal gradients for a battery pack are classified into internal and external thermal gradients. Internal thermal gradients are those that exist within-layer and between layer-to-layer in a cell, whereas external thermal gradients are thermal gradients on the battery surface and cell-to-cell thermal gradients. Internal thermal gradients could be enhanced by improving the material characteristics of anode, cathode, separator, and electrolyte [19], [20], [21]. In addition to that, special BTMSs are focused on the minimization of internal thermal gradients such as tab cooling and internal cooling. Temperature difference between cells in a pack lead to uneven degradation resulting in a capacity mismatch. Gogoana et al. [129] found that cycling two cells connected in parallel with 20 % of internal resistance mismatch could lead to a reduction in the battery life by 40 % compared with cells with approximately identical internal resistance. Therefore, a capacity tolerance, which is dependent on internal resistance mismatch, between cells in a pack is recommended to be below 2.5 % [87].
Research was conducted to evaluate the effects of thermal gradients within a cell. Carter et al. [130] found that the interelectrode thermal gradient direction significantly affects the degradation mode. After 20 cycles, 77 % capacity fade is resulted when the negative electrode is hotter than the positive electrode by 2 °C, whereas 100 % capacity fade exists when the positive electrode is hotter than the negative electrode by 2 °C. Fear et al. [131] demonstrated that in-plane thermal gradients lead to uneven active material usage and current distribution resulting in nonuniform lithium plating and accelerated degradation. Li et al. [132] investigated the effect of thermal gradients of a cylindrical cell and found that a temperature difference of 2 °C between the core and the surface led to a difference in the current density between the core and the surface by 16.4 %.
4.1.3. Waste heat recovery (WHR) and thermal energy storage (TES)
The heat produced by batteries is classified as a waste heat that could be either directly used by another system in a WHR process, whereas in a TES system the thermal waste is stored for usage in a later time or utilized for temperature control during inactive time. WHR of the high waste heat induced by internal combustion engines was previously studied for its exploitation in thermally powered refrigeration systems such as sorption and ejector cooling systems. Electric vehicles has a lower thermal waste from batteries and motors compared with combustion engines, however its recovery has motivated research [133]. As for TES, PCMs utilize the heat released from batteries during operation and control the storage temperature for long times during inactive mode [53]. Relying on PCM low thermal conductivity, Hallaj and Selman [134] found that PCMs can keep batteries at 10 °C higher than cold ambient temperatures after 24 h of parking.
On the other hand, various research focused on WHR for LIBs. Adsorption cycles as thermally powered systems are used for WHR by the integration with cabin thermal management systems [135]. A hybrid vapor compression-adsorption BTMS is used as a WHR method to provide cooling during summer and preheating during winter. Pan et al [135] found that R410A/active carbon adsorption pair along with vapor compression refrigeration system could lead to electricity saving on recovery mode during summer till 31.3 kJ and on preheating mode during winter till 67 kJ. Zou et al. [136] proposed a WHR system by the integration of the cabin and battery thermal management systems. The heat generated by cells is utilized for heat addition to the air conditioning system for air preheating on the heating mode, and air reheating on the cooling mode. Han et al. [137] proposed a BTMS and CTMS secondary-loop integration system for WHR from batteries to be utilized in cabin heating. The COP and heating capacity increased by 7.88 % and 13.57 %, respectively compared with a system without WHR. Ann et al. [138] also proposed a similar system for increasing the heating capacity of the EV heat pump at low temperatures. Weustenfeld et al. [139] proposed the usage of a compact secondary-loop BTMS/CTMS integration. The compactness comes from the existence of the evaporator and condenser out-of-cabin and the usage of a secondary-loop for cabin heat transfer.
4.2. Cooling techniques
The process of heat removal from cells to make it at the optimum temperature range is called battery cooling. When operating batteries at temperatures out of the optimum temperature range, reductions occur in energy and power obtained from a charge/discharge cycle and from multiple cycles. In addition to that, prevention of localized hot spots and temperature mismatch along the surface and inner layers is required to prevent electrochemical characteristics mismatch. Therefore, several conventional and revolutionary techniques were proposed to provide for high heat dissipation with homogeneous temperature distribution.
4.2.1. Internal cooling
Internal cooling focuses on the methods that should be adopted by the cell manufacturer such as electrodes materials and thickness. Electrodes are the major contributor to the heat generation by ohmic heating, so the reduction of internal resistance is basically aimed before cell assembly. Electrode thickness has a direct relation with heat generation as when the thickness increases the distance travelled by electrons and ions increases which increases the internal resistance and ohmic heating leading to a temperature increase [140]. On the other hand, lowering the electrode thickness lowers the energy utilization capability. Lu et al. [141] demonstrated that for 70 % of energy utilization, the electrode thickness must be above 130 µm. Particle size reduction of the electrodes also reduces the distance travelled by the ions and electrons. That is crucial as the diffusivity of the electrodes are lower than that of the electrolyte [142]. However, the particle size should not be lowered under a certain limit to preserve the available capacity [143]. Therefore, Electrode material selection is crucial for chemical, electrical, and thermal properties. Common anode materials are silicon alloys and graphite, whereas common cathode materials are LiCoO2 and LiFePO4. Several materials enhancements are adopted such as coatings with graphene and oxides besides doping with Te4+ cations and with conductive mediums as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and acetylene [144], [145].
Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) materials have a resistance increase with the increase of the temperature. PTCs are mainly used in batteries as a material enhancement acting as a thermal control strategy for thermal runaway prevention. Zhang et al. [146] proposed a protection method against thermal runaway based on current self-limiting mechanism by PTC materials. A PTC material is introduced by coating the Al electrode substrate with P3BT polymer to form a composite electrode. Results showed that when temperature reaches 150 °C, the impedance increases, and current limitation is achieved. Feng et al. [147] proposed the use of epoxy carbon coating as a PTC material for thermal runaway prevention. Results demonstrated that current is self-limited suddenly and immensely due to the sudden resistance increase at 100–130 °C while preserving normal operation at ambient temperature. Zhong et al. [148] proposed the integration of EVA as a PTC material into the cathode for thermal runaway prevention. The proposed composite cathode showed no degradation at room temperature. The current is self-limited at 90 °C which prevents thermal runaway before side reactions occurrence.
BTMSs embedded inside the battery reduce thermal gradients by the reduction of the heat transfer length by conduction and removing heat from internal local hot spots as summarized in Table 7. Mohammadian et al. [97] investigated the usage of microchannels embedded inside electrodes. Results revealed improved wettability of the porous electrodes and the thermal runaway could be prevented by decreasing the size and increasing the number of the integrated microchannels. Some research investigated cylindrical cells as Zhang et al. [149] who inserted a cooling strip with a copper pipe within the cylindrical cell hollow mandrel. At 1.5C of discharge, the maximum surface temperature is reduced by 1.4 °C compared to the original cell. However, the maximum internal temperature was greatly reduced compared to the maximum surface temperature.

Zhao et al. [150] replaced the hollow mandrel of a 40-cell cylindrical battery pack with a PCM. The PCM type, core size, and core size distribution were studied against temperature, thermal gradient, pack compactness, and solidification time. Results showed that a hybrid system of forced air of 1 m/s inlet velocity with PCM of 3.2 mm core could provide for a more compact pack with a temperature and thermal gradient below 40 °C and 5 °C, respectively. Gou et al. [151] made a hollow mandrel in a cylindrical battery to investigate the internal cooling with heat pipes and PCMs separately and with a hybrid system of heat pipes and PCMs. Results showed that the optimized mandrel diameter for PCM is 6 mm in terms of cost and efficiency. The hybrid system of heat pipes with PCMs achieved the best performance with maximum temperature and thermal gradient of 33.8 °C and 0.9 °C, respectively at 3C of discharge.
Other researchers studied prismatic and pouch cells by using similar principles as illustrated in Fig. 9. Elsewify et al. [152] investigated the internal cooling by circulating water into a macro-channel perpendicular to the cell surface of a large format pouch cell. Optimized design parameters such as channel size, location, and inlet velocity reduced the peak and average temperature of the cell by 20 % and 15 %, respectively at 5C of discharge. Increasing the inlet velocity was noticed to decrease the average and maximum temperature but increase the thermal gradient. Mohammadian et al. [153] numerically compared the transient behavior of internal cooling achieved by circulating liquid electrolyte in mini-channels embedded parallel to the cell surface inside the electrodes and the external surface cooling achieved by circulating water in mini-channels in contact with prismatic cells surfaces. Results revealed that internal cooling achieved lower bulk temperature and standard deviation for the same pumping power. As for the same pumping power of 0.024 W, the internal cooling achieved a temperature standard deviation decrease by 5 times compared with the external cooling. Internal cooling achieved lower intersection angle between the temperature gradient and the velocity vector which means higher local magnitudes of the two vectors leading to higher heat transfer by convection according to field synergy principle [154], [155].

Furthermore, Bandhauer and Garimella [156] investigated the internal cooling by developing a passive buoyancy-driven (thermosiphon) liquid–gas PCM system flowing through microchannels that either integrated within the battery current collector or by splitting the current collector and flowing the coolant within it. For investigated mass flux range of 45–112 kg/m2.s and heat input range of 94–6230 W/L. It was found that the maximum mass flow rate resulting from buoyancy was at 1350 W/L heat input. Bandhauer et al. [157], [158] numerically investigated various BTMSs for battery packs by using external surface side cooling using air and liquid cooling, external surface edge cooling, and internal cooling with passive buoyancy-driven (thermosiphon) microchannels with liquid–vapor PCM by embedding it within the current collector or by splitting the current collector to form a microchannel. Results showed that the pack size could not be reduced above a factor of 2 either by using side cooling or edge cooling, but it could be reduced by more than a factor of 10 using internal cooling.
4.2.2. External surface cooling
External surface cooling technique uses BTMSs on battery external faces except for tabs. Side cooling is when the large faces of a cell are in contact with a BTMS to make the heat transfer area as large as possible. On the other hand, edge cooling is applied on battery small surfaces only which makes the heat transfer area low. On the other hand, edge cooling provides for more compact BTMSs with low volume and weight as shown in Fig. 10. Furthermore, edge cooling depends on in-plane thermal conductivity as heat transfer moves along layers in parallel which increases thermal conductivity.

BTMSs could be classified according to power consumption into active and passive and according to the working fluid into air and liquid. In general, air cooling has low potential to cope with the heat generation from battery modules [159]. Therefore, methods to enhance conventional forced air cooling are introduced as swirl generators [160]. As to active air cooling, Wu [161] investigated through a multi-objective function the variation of 13 design variables related to design configuration and inlet flow rate to optimize the maximum cell temperature, maximum cell-to-cell temperature difference, and power consumption without volume change. The U-type configuration of a 12-prismatic-cell module showed better performance over the Z-type. Therefore, further optimizations are conducted on the U-type configurations. The optimized conditions led to a maximum temperature, temperature difference, and power consumption of 38.2 °C, 0.3 °C, 1.51 W, respectively.
Siruvuri and Budarapu [162] investigated active liquid cooling using a water coolant flows over circuitous rectangular aluminum channels sandwiched between cells. The proposed system reduced the maximum temperature by 5.85 % using 1.6 × 10−6m3/s compared with uncooled cells and the usage of reversal flow further reduced the maximum pack temperature by 2.77 °C. Wanittansirichok et al. [163] investigated the usage of a cold plate with flowing water in macro-channels with topology based on multi-objective optimization to thermally manage a 25Ah pouch NMC LIB. Compared with multi-parallel channels, the optimized topology could reduce the maximum temperature by 14 °C and the pressure drop by 20:80 %. Kausthubharam et al. [93] used diagonal type biomimetic mini channels with optimum inlet conditions of 25 °C and 12.5 cm3/s for a 20 Ah pouch cell. The proposed BTMS reduced the maximum temperature of a 43 V module by 20 % under the recommended range.
Sarchami et al. [164] investigated the usage of immersion cooling of dielectric deionized water and AgO nanoparticle with copper mold for risk management against scaling. A pool with circular honeycomb structure at inlet with 15 cells of 21,700 LIBs was utilized to investigate the impact of charge/discharge C-rates, AgO volume fraction, inlet temperature, and inlet velocity on thermal performance. At 5C of charge/discharge, the maximum temperature and thermal gradients could be maintained at 31.55 °C and 2.95 °C, respectively with 4 % volume fraction of AgO and 0.28 m/s inlet velocity.
Passive cooling was intensely studied to provide for cooling methods without energy or power consumption from cells [165]. Hirano et al. [166] investigated the usage of fast charging/discharging cycles on a 10 laminate-type LIB equipped with natural-convection air cooling. The maximum temperature and thermal gradients were 80 °C and 10 °C for 5 cycles of 10C, whereas 90 °C and 10 °C for 2 cycles of 20C. Furthermore, Gils et al. [167] investigated passive liquid cooling using a stagnant path of Novec7000 dielectric fluid with a fixed container wall temperature of 20 °C for a single cylindrical cell. The maximum temperature achieved is approximately 23 °C and the thermal gradient achieved between the positive and the negative battery poles is 0.7 °C during no phase change.
Another passive BTMS is PCMs which can efficiently release high heat dissipation power in a short time while maintaining the temperature of the batteries at the phase change temperature [168]. Therefore, PCMs are recommended as a quick response system for sudden failures and for thermal runaway prevention [15]. Xu et al. [169] investigated the usage of PCMs with fins and aerogel as an insulator for cold climates to thermally manage a battery pack of 5 prismatic cells and 120kWh. The results revealed that the proposed BTMS has a control of the battery temperature to be 20:80 °C with a temperature difference below 2.6 °C. Khaboshan et al. [92] investigated the integration of metal foams, fins and PCMs to optimize the BTMS performance at 3C of discharge. Results revealed that the integration results in a reduction in cells temperature by 3 °C and a decrease in temperature differences by 75 % compared to cooling with a PCM only.
Hybrid cooling systems integrated on battery sides only are also investigated for performance enhancements. Shahid and Chaab [170] investigated the usage of a hybrid air–liquid BTMS of active air cooling along with passive liquid cooling by embedding circular liquid jackets surrounding each cell in a cylindrical battery pack. Furthermore, they replaced the liquid cooling system using the liquid jacket with a passive evaporative liquid cooling using fiber channels and water rises by the capillary action from a reservoir below the pack to make up the evaporated water. Results revealed that the evaporative cooling based BTMS achieved a reduction by 50 % and 59 % in the increase in the maximum and average temperatures, respectively compared to the liquid jacket based BTMS. Subhedar et al. [145] used different concentrations of Al2O3/EG-Water nanofluid along with polylactic acid material coverage around cylindrical cells. Results showed that a concentration of 4 % maintains cells temperature at 50 °C.
Edge cooling has higher thermal conductivity compared to side cooling because side cooling is in contact with the battery small faces which are in contact with layers edges containing copper and aluminum current collectors. Therefore, the high thermal conductivity of the in-plane direction of layers is utilized. In addition to that, edge cooling based BTMSs could be applied with low volume and weight compared to side cooling. On the other hand, the heat transfer area is low compared with the external surface side cooling with high heat transfer area. Furthermore, the heat transfer length is high in edge cooling resulting in high thermal gradients along the battery length.
Tang et al. [171] investigated the usage of cold plates with mini-channels with water coolant to compare side cooling, edge cooling, and both side-edge cooling. Results revealed that the side-edge cooling system showed the best thermal performance. At 2C of discharge, the hybrid configuration achieved a maximum temperature and a thermal gradient of 23 °C and 3 °C, respectively for 20 °C and 2 L/min inlet conditions. Liu et al. [172] investigated the water cooling through indirect-contact macro-channels at the edges of 8 prismatic cells of 110Ah capacity. The maximum temperature and temperature difference achieved were 47.3 °C and 7.3 °C, respectively. The high thermal gradient existing within each battery along its length is attributed to the utilization of edge cooling. A comprehensive summary for different external surface cooling techniques is illustrated in Table 8.

4.2.3. External tab cooling
The difference in thermal conductivity for thermal conductors and thermal insulators have a small variation compared with the variation in electrical conductivity for electrical conductors and electrical insulators [173]. In addition to that, thermal contact resistance has a much higher contribution to the total resistance compared to electrical contact resistance. Therefore, heat transfer must have a good thermal conducting material with minimum contact resistance to flow efficiently. In addition to that, as illustrated in the thermal conductivity for LIBs, the heat transfer efficiently flows within the layer in parallel compared to in series. Tab/terminal cooling is then proposed to provide an efficient thermal flow path away from any insulators such as the battery casing in edge and side cooling. Fig. 11 is a schematic representation of the typical temperature difference between side, tab and hybrid tab-side cooling with cells colored by typical temperature distributions.

Fig. 11. Thermal distribution for cell cooled by (a) side cooling, (b) tab cooling (c) hybrid tab-side cooling.

Cooling tabs where highest temperature exists especially the negative tab has three benefits; providing for the highest temperature difference and consequently achieving highest heat dissipation rate along with the prevention of the backflow of heat from the hotspot area and consequently reduces the temperature difference through the cell surface [174]. Furthermore, tab cooling has a crucial advantage which is the low layer-to-layer thermal gradient that leads to even loading of each layer and even layers degradation that results in a lower overall degradation. On the other hand, tab cooling has two major drawbacks; the first one is that conventional cell designs are not compatible with tab cooling due to the recent focus on achieving higher energy density and ignoring the in-cell thermal design. The other one is the careful design of the cooling system due to the cooling of tabs where electricity flows [175]. A summary of previous studies focused on tab cooling is demonstrated in Table 9.

Numerous research focused on tab cooling of pouch cells. Hunt et al. [176] studied a 5Ah Kokam pouch cell to compare surface cooling with tab cooling. For a charge/discharge cycle, there was no difference in capacity fade between the two methods for low C-rates (C/20). At a high C-rate of 6C, the capacity fade was 9.2 % for surface cooling compared with 1.2 % for tab cooling. For 1000 cycles, the capacity fade for tab cooling was the third compared to surface cooling leading to three times longer life for tab cooling. The interpretation of the superior performance characteristics for tab cooling was that it has an overall better thermal gradient management. Tab cooling has lower layer-to-layer thermal gradients and a bit higher in-layer thermal gradient. Low layer-to-layer thermal gradients crucially lead to high layer-to-layer current homogeneities and even loading during cycles.
Zhao et al. [201] build a 2D electrochemical model to study the same pouch cell at 6C of discharge to further investigate the causes of higher performance related to tab cooling for a 5Ah Kokam pouch cell. They concluded that tab cooling results in lower overall thermal gradients but with higher average temperature compared to surface cooling. By using the model developed, they attributed the higher average temperature to the cell bad design which has a significant contact resistance between the current collectors and the tabs which limits the heat transfer rate through the tabs. Dondelewski et al. [120] investigated the trade-off between performance and degradation when using tab cooling and surface cooling by the ratio of the surface to tab cooling coefficients (
) at 2C of discharge by using Peltier elements. Results revealed that a 5Ah Kokam pouch has a
 = 3.07 which results in degradation and performance superiority for tab cooling over surface cooling. On the other hand, the 20Ah large form factor pouch cell has a
 = 18.09 resulted in 19 times larger temperature rise and accelerated degradation for tab cooling versus surface cooling. They concluded that larger capacity pouch cells led to lower thermal performance using tab cooling due to bad cell design and the incapability to dissipate the heat rate generated.
Several studies investigated the variations of the tab design parameters for thermal performance enhancement of pouch cells. Chang et al. [202] investigated the effect of tab design parameters on a 55Ah pouch cell. They found that increasing the width, reducing the length, and making the tab away from the edges and from each other enhance the thermal performance in terms of maximum temperature and temperature difference [114]. Results also revealed that making the tabs on counter sides and on adjacent sides have lower thermal gradients compared with tabs on the same side. Lee et al. [203] optimized the type and the attachment position of the tabs along with the cell aspect ratio while maintaining a fixed capacity of 45Ah for pouch cells. The optimized design was found to have a capacity fade reduction by 7.3 % compared to the initial design after 1000 cycles.
Zhao et al. [204] explored the design parameters to enhance tab cooling for 16Ah custom made pouch cells. They found that increasing the tab cross sectional area will increase the tab cooling heat rate dissipation ability to an extent that makes tab cooling comparable with surface cooling. They found that increasing the tab thickness and making the tabs at counter sides enhance thermal performance for tab cooling. A cell with tabs at counter sides with 70 mm tab thickness cooled using tab cooling has a reduced maximum cell temperature by 14 % and lower thermal gradients by 5 times compared with a cell with tabs at the same side with 30 mm tab thickness cooled using surface cooling. Theinglim and Poramapojana [205] investigated the usage of tab cooling on a 25Ah NMC pouch cell with tabs on counter sides. Results revealed that the thermal conductivity for the cell length and width are 27.4 times larger than that of the cell thickness.
Mei et al. [206] investigated the tab dimensions at 4C of discharge for an 18.5Ah pouch cell. For higher thermal performance, results revealed that the optimized values are 0.2 × 35 × 20 mm3 for thickness, width, and height, respectively. Du et al. [207] studied the thermal behavior for different tab designs for 10Ah pouch cells and also found that counter tabs and wider tabs have better thermal performance especially at 10C of discharge. Samba et al. [208] investigated the tab location on a 45Ah pouch cell by studying tabs on counter sides or on the same side whether the sides are the long or short edges to form four cases of tab designs. Results revealed that counter sides configurations represented enhanced performance in terms of current and potential density gradients resulting in lower ohmic loss and capacity fade leading to lower thermal gradients across the cell.
On the other hand, other researchers focused on tab cooling of cylindrical cells. Bolsinge and Birke [209] compared between tab cooling through a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and surface cooling through active air cooling for a 2.5Ah 26,650 cylindrical cell. They found that for a heat generation rate of 4.5 W, surface cooling with air velocity of 7.8 m/s or tab cooling with a TEC supply current of 364 mA could dissipate 4.4 W with the remaining residuals (0.1 W) attributed to natural convection, radiation, and conduction to the cell tester. The tab cooling achieved a half radial thermal gradient compared with the surface cooling with similar axial thermal gradients resulting in an overall lower degradation for tab cooling.
Li et al. [132] investigated the effect of cell designs and number of tabs on 21,700 cylindrical cells based on an electro-chemical model along with experiments. Results showed that increasing the number of tabs per current collector beyond one will increase the current homogeneities and decrease the thermal gradients by 25.41 % for all-tab (tab-less) cells. They also found that the thermal gradients for both surface and base cooling are the same. On the other hand, surface cooling has a higher heat dissipation rate due to the increased cooling area available. Li et al. [132] investigated the number of tabs for 5Ah 21,700 cylindrical cells. It was found that utilizing the tab-less design reduced the average temperature and thermal gradients by 13.55 % and 25.41 %, respectively compared with the single tab design. Tranter et al. [210] found that tab-less battery has a lower ohmic resistance which lowers the heat generation to the fifth compared to conventional cylindrical cells which results in higher efficiency and capacity. Furthermore, dielectric immersion cooling could provide for surface and tab cooling without the complexity of adding an individual system for tab cooling [175].
Therefore, Tab-less 4680 batteries proposed by Panasonic and Tesla could be a significant candidate for tab cooling. Li et al. [52] found that surface area to volume ratio and internal thermal contact resistances are major factors for determining the thermal performance based on cell design and for cooling method selection. It was found that for LG M50T 21,700 cells, the surface area to volume ratio is large compared to 4680 Tesla cells leading to better thermal performance using side cooling. The average temperature and thermal gradients were 4.81 °C and 2.83 °C for 2170 cells and were 13.23 °C and 23.02 °C for 4680 cells using side cooling by conduction. On the other hand, internal contact thermal resistances are lower for 4680 Tesla cell compared to LG M50T 21,700 making base cooling a better choice for 4680 cells [52]. The average temperature and thermal gradients were 5.62 °C and 7.61 °C for 4680 cells and were 33.33 °C and 35.66 °C for 2170 cells using base cooling by conduction.
Moreover, Researchers conducted various studies on tab cooling for prismatic cells. Schmidt et al. [211] compared the cooling of a large format prismatic cell of 120Ah by four methods; no cooling, tab cooling, surface edge cooling, and surface side cooling. Surface edge cooling was found to have the maximum thermal gradient of 25.6 °C causing the largest discharge rate variation for the cell with a maximum local discharge rate of 2.8C when the global discharge rate is 2C. Furthermore, the SoC inhomogeneities are 8.5 %, 4.2 %, 2.9 %, and 1.6 %, for surface edge cooling, surface side cooling, no cooling, and tab cooling, respectively. Kleiner et al. [212] investigated tab cooling for a 25Ah prismatic cell by connecting the tabs to heat pipes. The results revealed a reduction in the tab temperature by 50 °C and in the jelly roll thermal gradients with a maximum of 4.3 °C at boost charging with 2:7C. Zhao et al. [213] investigated the tab design represented by the number of tabs and their locations to reduce the ohmic loss and for uniform active material utilization by reducing the electron path for 40Ah prismatic cells. Furthermore, they developed for the first time a quantitative relation between the energy density and the current density.
On the other hand, many researchers extended their study to complete battery modules. Wang et al. [125] investigated the implementation of the tab cooling using passive and active air cooling for pouch cells using the module cooling coefficient (MCC). Results revealed that performance is enhanced by using wet air rather than dry air. However, increasing the relative humidity from 15 % to 75 % was of insignificant impact. They also found that increasing the air velocity has a great impact on heat dissipation rate. Liebertseder et al. [214] work on using tab cooling for pouch modules using thermally conductive plastics. Results revealed that good thermal gradients within cells but bad thermal gradients between cells are observed and attributed to the poor tab designs.
Heimes et al. [215] modelled cold plates of thermally conductive polymers for tab cooling of pouch modules and focused on contact resistances effects. Results showed that this design is efficient for charging at 1C rate with limitations attributed to cell and module levels. For the cell level, the contact resistance and the cross-sectional area between current collectors and tabs have significant effects. For the module level, the thermal conductivity of the cold plate and the contact resistance between different components are the crucial parameters. Veth et al. [56] investigated the effect of tab cooling on a 50Ah pouch cell and on 3 modules of 31 cells each. They depicted the effect of tab cooling on the migration of the hotspot from the tab to the cell center by using multiple sensors dispersed on the cell to illustrate the thermal gradient enhancement.
Li et al. [216] compared the thermal performance of external surface and tab cooling by cold plates with mini-channels for an 18,650 cylindrical battery module at 1C of discharge. The proposed system achieved a maximum temperature and thermal gradients of 35.48 °C and 2.86 °C for tab cooling and 30.84 °C and 5.76 °C for side cooling, respectively. The results revealed that tab cooling achieved lower thermal gradients, but higher temperatures compared with side cooling. To decrease thermal gradients for side cooling, results demonstrated that increasing the surface contact angle for side cooling from 90 to 135 increased the surface contact area and reduced the thermal gradients by 29.92 %.
4.2.4. Hybrid cooling
Hybrid cooling techniques are integrated together to get the best of individual techniques while reducing their drawbacks. Hybridization is adopted for maximizing overall thermal management objectives with lowest energy and power consumption, cost, volume, and weight of BTMSs. On the other hand, hybridization generally increases design complications and safety risks. Therefore, trade-offs should be studied based on various design and performance parameters encountered. A brief comparison of different research on hybridizations of tab-surface and tab-internal cooling is listed in Table 10.

Many researchers investigated various hybrid tab-surface cooling techniques for optimization purposes. Patil et al. [217] used a numerical model along with experiments to investigate a hybrid strategy by immersion cooling for sides and air cooling for tabs for pouch cells and modules. For a cell at 3C of discharge, the peak temperature at the positive tab was reduced by 46.8 % using the proposed BTMS compared with natural convection air cooling. For a 50 V module at 5C of discharge, the maximum temperature was preserved under 40 °C with a 9.3 % reduction compared with indirect-contact water-ethylene glycol liquid cooling.
Bazinski and Wang [218] used a hybrid natural convection air cooling for surface cooling and cold plate for tab cooling to investigate tab cooling ability on a 14Ah pouch cell. Compressed air was used for the cold plate instead of water for the sake of safety and simplicity. Tab cooling was used for the cathode tab only as a major source for heat generation compared with the anode tab, especially the contribution of the contact resistance between the cathode stack and the cathode tab. Furthermore, higher thermal resistance is also attributed to using aluminum as a current collector for cathode compared to copper with higher thermal conductivity for the anode. In general, it was found that tab cooling is effective for reducing the average temperature by 5 °C for 8C of discharge due to removing the heat directly from its source. At high C-rates (3C and 8C of discharge), tab cooling has a negligible effect on improving thermal gradients.
Ham et al. [174] investigated the cooling of a 40Ah pouch cell through indirect-contact liquid surface cooling with and without tab cooling. Tab cooling is achieved by connecting the cell tabs to the liquid cooling system through ceramics as aluminum nitride and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Enhanced thermal performance in terms of mean temperature and temperature difference at discharging rates of 1:5C for tab cooling with aluminum nitride and aluminum oxide are 137:281 % and 8.8:16 %, respectively compared to the case of no tab cooling. Furthermore, at 5C of discharge, the enhancement of the equivalent full cycle (EFC) which is a representation for aging rate reciprocal is enhanced through tab cooling by 8:13 % depending on the type of ceramics and fin thicknesses used. Gocmen and Cetkin [219] investigated the usage of tab cooling by copper fins attached to the tabs along with surface cooling by forced convection air cooling as a BTMS for a 1S6P module of 7.5Ah Kokam pouch cells. At 3C of discharge, the maximum temperature and temperature difference percentage were 39 °C and 4.3 %, respectively with 32.5 % enhancement in thermal gradients attributed to the tab cooling utilization.
Dubey et al. [220] investigated the geometry modification of a 2.2Ah 18,650 cylindrical cell by changing the length to diameter ratio to study the cell design effect. Three cases were studied named large, datum, and small geometries with length to diameter ratios of 5.25, 3.61, and 2.38, respectively. Results revealed that minimum average temperature, minimum radial thermal gradient, and maximum heat dissipation rate are attributed to datum, large, and small geometries, respectively. Furthermore, they compared three cooling methods: surface cooling, tab cooling of both tabs, and hybrid tab-surface cooling. Results demonstrated that minimum axial and radial thermal gradients are achieved by surface cooling and tab cooling, respectively while lowest average temperature is achieved by the hybrid tab-surface cooling.
On the other hand, hybrid tab-internal cooling was investigated by Worwood et al. [221] through inserting a heat pipe in the cylindrical cell mandrel with metallic aluminum spreader discs at both cylindrical ends. The proposed design with single-side tab cooling provides for the same performance as the double-side tab cooling without pack complications. The thermal resistance of the proposed system achieved a reduction in the thermal resistance by 67.8 % compared to single-side tab cooling. The proposed cooling system can emulate the thermal performance of the double-tab cooling for a battery module without complications. The heat pipe and heat spreaders incorporation enhance thermal performance but increase cell mass and consequently decreases energy density. The mass increases were 11.7 % and 10.0 % and the energy density reductions were 5.8 % and 6 % for an 18,650 cell with 3 mm heat pipe and 2 mm spreader and for a 32,113 cell with 6 mm heat pipe and 2 mm spreader, respectively.
5. Conclusions
A comprehensive articulation of battery components, materials, construction, principles, and design forms were demonstrated. Revolutionary design forms such as tab-less, structural, and blade batteries were also stated for presenting their potential. 4680 tab-less cells have both lower average temperature and thermal gradients by approximately 28 °C compared to LG M50T 21,700 cells using tab cooling. Afterwards, thermal characteristics were focused on illustrating the effects of thermal performance on electrochemical performance for both cell and module levels. Thermal performance parameters were summarized based on temperature related parameters as maximum, average, maximum difference, standard deviation, and uniformity coefficient. Furthermore, Heat rate based performance parameters are discussed such as the cell cooling coefficient (CCC), module cooling coefficient (MCC), and cooling energy efficiency coefficient.
Finally, battery thermal management systems were investigated by stating their objectives followed by a deep focus on recent and revolutionary cooling methods as follows:
•
Internal cooling represented a great tool to lower internal cell thermal gradients with techniques mainly adopted by cell manufacturers.
•
External surface cooling techniques were categorized into side cooling to utilize higher heat transfer areas and edge cooling to utilize the high thermal conductivity.
•
External tab cooling was deeply investigated to show its ability to lower thermal gradients and increase electrochemical performance.
•
Hybridization techniques were introduced to maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks of individual techniques.
In conclusion, tab cooling results in low thermal gradients with limited heat dissipation rates compared to other methods according to recent cell designs. Alterations in tab design and tab connection into layers as adopted in revolutionary designs could lead to thermal performance breakthroughs in tab cooling with minimum power, weight, and volume consumption leading to optimized electrochemical performance.
