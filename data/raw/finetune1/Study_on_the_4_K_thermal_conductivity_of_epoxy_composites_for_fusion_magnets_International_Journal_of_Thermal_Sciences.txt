Abstract
In magnetically confined nuclear fusion devices, cryogenic superconducting magnets operating at 4 K require epoxy composites as an adhesive with thermal conductivity matching that of the mechanical materials, 316LN stainless steel, at this temperature. This study investigated the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites at 4 K through experiments and finite element method (FEM). For discrete-filler epoxy composites (DFECs), the effects of filler thermal conductivity (kf), filler volume fraction (φf), filler shape, and contact thermal conductance (Kcon) were analyzed, revealing that their 4 K thermal conductivity remains limited to approximately 10−2 W m−1 K−1. Further analysis from heat transfer and solid-state physics perspectives indicates that a continuous filler network is essential for matching the thermal conductivity of 316LN. Subsequently, a continuous filler epoxy composites (CFECs) incorporating copper foam as the filler was developed. Experimental characterization and finite element modeling based on its porous skeleton demonstrate that when the filler content is ≤ 30 vol%, the thermal conductivity at 4 K can reach 100–102 W m−1 K−1. Moreover, when the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the filler is extremely high, the overall thermal conductivity becomes less sensitive to the continuity level. Finally, considering engineering application, a quasi-continuous filler strategy is proposed, which potentially enables the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites matching with 316LN at 4 K using a filler below 10 vol%.

1. Introduction
The toroidal field (TF) magnet is a core component of tokamak fusion devices, primarily consisting of a coil casing and superconducting coils [1]. Current TF coils in ITER, JT-60SA, and EAST employed low-temperature superconductors such as NbTi or Nb3Sn, which exhibit superconductivity only at approximately 4 K [2]. To facilitate this, the coils are wound using Cable-in-Conduit Conductor (CICC), which incorporates internal channels for forced-flow liquid helium cooling. The coil casing, which encases the TF coils, is designed with numerous helium cooling channels on its surface to prevent heat leakage into the coils. These channels consist of grooves machined into the coil case surface, embedded cooling pipes, and a thermally conductive medium (TCM) filling the gaps between the pipes and grooves [3]. Epoxy composites, valued for their excellent mechanical and adhesive properties, were first adopted by ITER as the TCM in TF coil casing cooling channels [4]. Specifically, ITER has used a wollastonite-epoxy composites with a high filler volume fraction of ∼46 vol%. According to publicly available ITER documentation, prior to this study, the 4 K thermal conductivity and thermal expansion rate of this composite were measured as 0.19 W m−1 K−1 [3] and 0.49 %, respectively. In comparison, the coil casing mechanical material, cryogenic austenitic stainless steel 316LN or N50, exhibits a 4 K thermal conductivity of 0.28 W m−1 K−1 and a thermal expansion rate of 0.3 % [5]. Although the epoxy composite's thermal and expansion properties still offer room for optimization relative to 316LN, its filler loading is already near the practical limit. Excessive addition of fillers will cause the epoxy composites to lose its adhesive properties. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop high-thermal-conductivity epoxy composites with low filler content, thereby enhancing 4 K thermal conductivity while reserving space for other functional additives.
This work employs a cost-effective combined approach of experiment and FEM to investigate the 4 K thermal conductivity of epoxy composites. Spherical copper epoxy composites (SCEC) were fabricated and its thermal conductivity was characterized at 4 K. Using FEM, key factors influencing thermal conductivity in DFECs, such as filler thermal conductivity kf, filler volume fraction φf, contact thermal conductance Kcon, and filler shape, were systematically analyzed. Heat transfer theory and solid-state physics principles were then applied to explain the fundamental limitations on thermal conductivity of DFECs at 4 K. Subsequently, foam copper epoxy composites (FCEC) as a CFECs were developed. The studies of Experiment and FEM demonstrated that CFECs can achieve exceptionally high 4 K thermal conductivity (∼102 W m−1 K−1). However, the lack of moldability in uncured CFECs limits their practical application. To address this, a quasi-continuous filler epoxy composite (Q-CFECs) design was proposed, using appropriate filler shape and an induced fabrication method. This approach shows promise in achieving 4 K thermal conductivity exceeding that of 316LN stainless steel, even at low filler loadings (<10 vol%). This study aims to develop low-filler, high-thermal-conductivity epoxy composites compatible with 316LN at 4 K, providing critical thermal management solutions for cryogenic superconducting magnets in future fusion reactors.
2. Method
2.1. Experiment
Given copper's exceptionally high thermal conductivity at 4 K, reaching up to 16200 W m−1 K−1 [6], copper was selected as the thermally conductive filler in this study. SCEC: Atomized spherical copper powder with particle size specifications ranging from 20 to 110 μm was used as the filler. Epoxy composites with copper volume fractions of 10 vol%, 20 vol%, and 30 vol% were fabricated via vacuum mechanical stirring. To mitigate sedimentation caused by the large density mismatch between copper (8.9 × 103 kg m−3) and epoxy resin (1.1 × 103 kg m−3), fumed silica was added as an anti-settling agent at a mass ratio of epoxy resin to fumed silica of 20:1. FCEC: Porous foam copper was immersed in the aforementioned mixture with epoxy and fumed silica, and infiltrated under vacuum condition to ensure complete filling of the foam's internal pores. Thermal conductivity measurements were performed using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), and microstructural characterization was carried out with an OLYMPUS BX51M optical microscope.
2.2. Finite element method
2.2.1. Code-based CAD modelling
This study utilizes a code-driven CAD modeling methodology, implemented within the Python environment via FreeCAD, to generate three-dimensional geometries for FEM. Inspired by the work of Anuraag Saini et al., who used randomly distributed particles to investigate heat conduction in heterogeneous materials [7], a Python script was developed to generate spherical particles with random spatial positions and diameters ranging from 20 to 110 μm. This script was executed within FreeCAD, leveraging its underlying geometric kernel, OpenCASCADE Technology, to perform realistic non-overlapping checks and ensure geometric integrity among particles. The resulting random spherical particle model generated in FreeCAD is shown in Fig. 1a. In addition to spherical particles, this work also constructed other geometries, including cylindrical particles (Fig. 1b), sphere and cylinder particles (Fig. 1c), and porous skeleton (Fig. 1d).

2.2.2. Thermal analysis
For a single-homogeneous material, the temperature can be obtained by solving the steady-state heat conduction equation without internal heat generation [8]:
(1)
where ∇2 is the Laplacian operator and T denotes temperature.
In contrast, modeling heat transfer in composites requires accounting for the Kcon between the two constituent phases. In the FEM, Kcon is defined as the reciprocal of the ratio between the temperature difference across the interface and the interfacial heat flux density [9]:
(2)
Here, Ta and Tb are the temperatures on either side of the interface, and qcon is the heat flux through the interface.
Based on Equations (1), (2), appropriate boundary conditions can be applied to the unit shown in Fig. 2 to solve for the internal temperature distribution. In this work, the following boundary conditions were used to compute the thermal conductivity: a constant heat flux density qx was imposed on the hot face, while a fixed temperature T2 was applied on the cold face. The resulting temperature gradient was then substituted into Equation (3) to calculate the thermal conductivity of the composite in a specific direction (e.g., the x-direction thermal conductivity, kx) [10].

3. Result and discussion
3.1. Finite element verification
Fig. 3 shows an optical micrograph (200 magnification) of the SCEC. The spherical copper particles are randomly and discretely dispersed throughout the epoxy, with no obvious agglomeration or stacking observed. The observable particle sizes primarily range from approximately 20 to 110 μm, although smaller particles (<20 μm) are also uniformly dispersed in the epoxy. It should be noted that the actual copper particles are not perfectly spherical; some irregularly shaped particles are also present. Overall, the microstructural characteristic of SCEC with copper loadings of 10–30 vol% is the discrete distribution of filler within the epoxy. The thermal conductivity of DFECs at 4 K will be thoroughly discussed in Section 3.2.

The results of experiment and FEM are shown in Fig. 4. Within the copper loading range of 10–30 vol%, both the measured and simulated thermal conductivities of the SCEC fall within the order of 10 −2 W m−1 K−1, and both increase monotonically with increasing copper volume fraction. Notably, all experimental values are consistently higher than the FEM predictions. Considering the practical limitations in both sample fabrication and finite element modeling, the primary reasons for this discrepancy include: (1) The geometric models used in FEM cannot fully replicate the actual particle distribution, particularly neglecting the contribution of smaller particles to thermal conduction; (2) Despite mitigation efforts, sedimentation of copper particles still occurs during sample preparation, leading to locally higher copper concentrations in the regions selected for measurement; (3) Volume shrinkage of the epoxy during curing results in an actual copper volume fraction that exceeds the nominal design value. In light of these inherent limitations of the finite element method, particularly regarding microstructural fidelity, this study employs it solely for semi-quantitative trend analysis, not for precise thermal conductivity prediction.

3.2. Thermal conductivity of DFECs
The thermal conductivity of DFECs is governed by several factors: filler volume fraction (φf), intrinsic filler thermal conductivity (kf), filler shape, and contact conductance (Kcon). To evaluate these influences, finite element analyses were conducted under consistent boundary conditions: a heat flux of q = 100 W m−2 applied at the hot face and a fixed temperature of T2 = 4 K on the cold face.
With φf, Kcon, and filler shape held constant, three fillers with progressively higher thermal conductivities at 4 K were examined: 316LN stainless steel (0.28 W m−1 K−1 [5]), 5056 aluminum alloy (4 W m−1 K−1 [11]), and pure copper (∼104 W m−1 K−1). As shown in Fig. 5a, the composites thermal conductivity (kc) increases with kf, in the low-kf regime, kc rises with kf, whereas in the high-kf regime, kc saturates. A similar saturation trend emerges when only the Kcon is varied. Keeping φf, kf, and filler shape fixed while increasing Kcon from 3000 to 14000 W m−2 K−1 results in a monotonic rise in kc across all tested loadings (10–30 vol%), yet the rate of increase gradually slows (Fig. 5b). To visualize the role of φf more intuitively, Fig. 5c presents the temperature of spherical particles and kc as φf increases from 10 to 30 vol%. The peak temperature drops from 5.4 K to approximately 4.8 K—roughly a 0.3 K reduction per 10 vol% increase. The peak kc only reached 0.034 W m−2 K−1. Further insights come from comparing different filler shape (Fig. 5d). Using an epoxy with thermal conductivity of 0.015 W m−2 K−1: 10 vol% spherical copper particles raises kc by 0.006 W m−2 K−1, yielding a gain of 6 × 10−4 W m−1 K−1 per vol%; 5 vol% cylindrical copper particles 8 × 10−4 W m−1 K−1 per vol%; 8.9 vol% cylindrical and spherical copper particles reach 12 × 10−4 W m−1 K−1 per vol%. These results confirm that non-spherical, high-aspect-ratio fillers, especially sphere and cylinder combination, are far more effective at enhancing thermal transport.

Nevertheless, despite optimizing all parameters except filler shape, it remains practically unattainable to elevate the 4 K thermal conductivity of DFECs into the 0.2–0.3 W m−1 K−1. Their performance appears intrinsically capped at the 10−2 W m−1 K−1 order of magnitude. Notably, cylindrical fillers, due to their high aspect ratio, tend to overlap or contact each other at elevated loadings, inadvertently forming continuous thermal networks and transforming the system from DFECs into CFECs. The thermal behavior of CFECs will be detailed in Section 3.3. The following focuses on elucidating the physical mechanisms that constrain the thermal conductivity of DFECs at cryogenic temperatures.
From the perspective of heat transfer, a heat flux qi in DFECs must inevitably pass through a series thermal resistance unit composed of “filler–interface–epoxy” as illustrated in Fig. 6 [12]. Since thermal resistance is proportional to the conduction path length and inversely proportional to thermal conductivity [8], an order-of-magnitude estimate can be made: at 4 K, the thermal conductivity of epoxy resin is approximately 10−2 W m−1 K−1, whereas that of pure copper filler can reach 104 W m−1 K−1. In this series structure, if the conduction path lengths of the epoxy and filler are comparable, on the order of 102 μm, the thermal resistance of the epoxy (∼10−2 K W−1) is roughly one million times (106) greater than that of the copper filler (∼10−8 K W−1). The contact thermal resistance is given by the product of the reciprocal of the Kcon and the contact area. For micrometer-sized spherical fillers, the surface area is approximately 10−8 m2, and the Kcon typically lies around 103 W m−2 K−1 [13], yielding an contact thermal resistance on the order of 10−11 K W−1—about nine orders of magnitude lower than that of the epoxy. Consequently, in DFECs, the thermal resistance of the epoxy overwhelmingly dominates over those of both the filler and the interface, acting as the bottleneck in the overall series conduction path.

From the perspective of solid-state physics, the total thermal conductivity of a solid material is the sum of its phonon contribution (kphonon) and electronic contribution (kelectron) [14]. Phonons, as bosons, obey the Bose-Einstein distribution (Equation (4)):
(4)
ћ
where ℏ = 1.054571817 × 10−34 J s−1 is the reduced Planck constant, ѡ (rad s−1) is the angular frequency, kB = 1.380649 × 10−23 J K−1 is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
At cryogenic temperatures, the exponential term grows rapidly, causing the average phonon occupation number n to approach zero. Consequently, lattice vibrations can no longer effectively excite phonons, and the phonon-mediated heat conduction channel is essentially shut down. Under these conditions, thermal transport is dominated by free electrons. For instance, diamond, a prototypical phonon-dominated thermal conductor, exhibits a very low thermal conductivity of only 0.01–0.1 W m−1 K−1 at 4 K [15].
In contrast, at ultra-low temperatures, atoms are nearly frozen in their lattice sites, drastically reducing phonon scattering of electrons. This allows electrons to move through the lattice with minimal resistance. As a result, metals with abundant free electrons, such as silver and copper, demonstrate exceptional thermal conductivity at cryogenic temperatures. The thermal conductivity of metals follows the Wiedemann-Franz law (Equation (5)) [16]:
(5)
where L ≈ 2.44 × 10−8 W Ω K−2 is the Lorenz number, σ is the electrical conductivity (S·m−1), and T is temperature.
As temperature decreases, the electrical conductivity of pure metals increases dramatically; for example, silver and copper can achieve conductivities exceeding 1012 S m−1 at 4 K [17], corresponding to thermal conductivities as high as 104 W m−1 K−1. However, when such highly conductive metallic fillers are embedded into an epoxy, the insulating nature of epoxy prevents free electrons from entering the polymer phase. Heat transfer within the epoxy therefore remains confined to the inefficient phonon mechanism. In DFECs, heat must traverse a series path: electron conduction (in filler) and phonon conduction (interface and epoxy resin, forming a hybrid but discontinuous conduction pathway.
In summary, combining this solid-state physics insight with the earlier heat transfer analysis, it becomes clear that to significantly enhance the 4 K thermal conductivity of epoxy composites at low filler loadings, and match the performance of metals like stainless steel, one must establish a continuous electronic conduction network within the epoxy. Theoretically, the “effective width” (i.e., connectivity and cross-sectional area) of this electronic pathway directly determines the ultimate thermal conductivity achievable in such composites.
3.3. Thermal conductivity of CFECs
As discussed in Section 3.2, the reason for the low thermal conductivity of DFECs at 4 K is the absence of a continuous electronic conduction pathway within the epoxy. To address this limitation, an effective approach is to decouple the highly conductive filler from the original series conduction path and instead establish a parallel, independent electronic heat conduction channel. Such a parallel architecture can carry the majority of the heat load, thereby significantly alleviating the thermal transport burden on the epoxy and dramatically enhancing the overall thermal conductivity. In this work, porous foam copper was employed as the filler to construct a continuous thermal network throughout the composites. As shown in Fig. 7, once an efficient electronic thermal conduction pathway is established, the 4 K thermal conductivity of the FCEC increases to 76.39 W m−1 K−1 by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to DFECs at the same filler volume fraction. Furthermore, FEM was performed on the porous skeleton filler (pore diameter: 100 μm; center-to-center pore spacing: 80–90 μm) illustrated in Fig. 1d. The simulations predict that, within a filler volume fraction range of 10–30 vol%, the thermal conductivity of such composites reaches 100–102 W m−1 K−1—far exceeding the performance limits of conventional DFECs.

Fig. 7. Thermal conductivity of CFECs at 4 K.

Although CFECs exhibit exceptionally high thermal conductivity at 4 K, far surpassing that of 316LN stainless steel, their fabrication methods (e.g., vacuum pressure impregnation) and the structural rigidity of the porous skeleton filler eliminate the material's moldability before curing, making them unsuitable for complex geometries such as narrow grooves or intricate channels. Moreover, in practical formulations, the epoxy is often loaded with multiple functional additives, such as ZrW2O8 for controlling thermal expansion [18], fumed silica for viscosity control, and glass fibers for mechanical reinforcement, which significantly increase resin viscosity and may impede complete infiltration into the fine pores of copper foam.
To balance processability and thermal performance, an ideal strategy would preserve the moldability of a DFECs during processing while achieving the high thermal conductivity of a DFECs after curing. As noted in Section 3.2, cylindrical fillers at elevated volume fractions inevitably overlap in three-dimensional space. During composites fabrication, such overlaps can be interpreted as physical contacts between fillers, forming narrow yet potentially effective local conduction pathways. However, the extent to which this weak continuity enhances the 4 K thermal conductivity remains unclear. To systematically investigate the impact of filler connectivity on cryogenic thermal transport, this work establishes five representative thermal conduction models with varying continuity, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Taking a 6.8 vol% porous copper skeleton as an example, its internal conduction pathways are progressively severed along planes perpendicular to the x-axis, step by step, until the network is fully disconnected, thereby simulating a controlled transition from highly continuous to entirely discrete filler structure.

The thermal conductivity of the five models shown in Fig. 8 (case-1 to case-5), representing varying filler connectivity, was computed under the boundary conditions of a heat flux (q = 100 W m−2) at the hot face and a fixed cold-face temperature (T2 = 4 K). The results are presented in Fig. 9a. From case-1 to case-4, the kc decreases only slightly, remaining around 100 W m−1 K−1. However, between case-4 and case-5, a sharp drop occurs—falling from 100 W m−1 K−1 to 10−2 W m−1 K−1. This trend reveals a key insight: when copper is used as the filler, even a moderately connected network (as in case-4) can sustain a thermal conductivity on the order of 100 W m−1·K−1—far exceeding that of 316LN stainless steel at 4 K. This exceptional performance stems from copper's extremely high intrinsic thermal conductivity at cryogenic temperatures, which effectively compensates for limited network continuity. To verify this hypothesis, the porous scaffold material was replaced with 5056 aluminum alloy, while keeping all boundary conditions unchanged. The recalculated results for the same five cases are shown in Fig. 9b. With the kf reduced from 104 W m−1 K−1 to 4 W m−1 K−1, the kc becomes highly sensitive to filler connectivity. In summary, establishing a continuous filler network is essential to achieve epoxy composites whose 4 K thermal conductivity matches that of austenitic stainless steel. Nevertheless, using fillers with exceptionally high cryogenic thermal conductivity, such as pure copper, can significantly relax the requirement for perfect continuity, offering a promising pathway to balance processability and thermal performance in practical applications.

In practical fabrication, to preserve the moldability of epoxy composites before curing, micron-scale thermally conductive fillers are typically dispersed into the epoxy. A promising optimization strategy involves incorporating microscale porous skeleton fillers with high apparent volume and applying an external induction method, such as vibration or pressure, to reduce interparticle spacing until particle contact is achieved, thereby forming a continuous electronic conduction network for the fabrication of Q-CFECs. According to the computational results presented in this work, combining such porous scaffold fillers with induction-assisted densification techniques could enable epoxy composites with low filler loading (e.g., 10 vol%) to achieve a thermal conductivity at 4 K that exceeds that of cryogenic-grade austenitic stainless steel 316LN (0.28 W m−1 K−1). This approach not only ensures high thermal performance but also leaves ample room in the formulation for tailoring other critical properties, such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strength, and dielectric behavior, thereby supporting multifunctional composite design.
4. Engineering application outlook
In alignment with the introduction, this section briefly outlines and envisions the engineering application of epoxy-based composites in the cooling channels of TF coil casing for tokamak devices. The discussion is grounded in the specific engineering context of the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology (CRAFT) TF coil casing (Fig. 10) [3]. Numerous cooling channels are integrated into key segments: AU, BU, AP, BP, and SP2. On the side facing the superconducting coils, these components machined grooves to install cooling pipes. The annular gap between each groove and its cooling pipe is filled with a TCM—an epoxy-based composites [19]. The TCM of CRAFT TF coil case has employed the wollastonite-epoxy composites originally developed for the ITER project. During installation, a controlled amount of uncured epoxy composite is first pre-filled into the groove. The cooling pipes is then inserted using combined vibration and mechanical pressing to ensure intimate contact, followed by topping off with additional composites to completely level the surface.

If the Q-CFEC proposed in this work is adopted, the downward pressing of the cooling pipes during assembly will compress the porous skeleton fillers. Under this mechanical action, adjacent porous skeleton fillers are brought into close proximity or even direct contact, forming a quasi-continuous electronic thermal conduction pathway that significantly enhances the overall thermal conductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the inherent porosity of the skeleton provides built-in void space that can accommodate functional additives, for instance, to tailor the coefficient of thermal expansion, enhance mechanical properties, or adjust rheology, thereby offering ample formulation flexibility for multi-functional optimization.
5. Conclusions
This study systematically investigates the key factors governing the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites at 4 K through experimental characterization and FEM. The main conclusions are as follows.
(1)
The extremely low thermal conductivity of DFECs at 4 K stems fundamentally from the absence of a continuous electronic conduction pathway within the epoxy. Merely optimizing filler morphology, volume fraction, interfacial thermal conductance, or intrinsic filler conductivity is insufficient to achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in discrete-filler systems, rendering them incapable of matching the 4 K thermal conductivity of stainless steels such as 316LN.
(2)
The CFECs can achieve a high 4 K thermal conductivity (∼102 W m−1 K−1) by establishing an electronic conduction network. Importantly, when high-kf material such as copper are used, the kc becomes less sensitive to the degree of network continuity; conversely, for low-kf material, the kc exhibits strong dependence on connectivity.
(3)
By employing high-thermal-conductivity materials (e.g., Cu, Ag) in porous skeleton fillers, combining them with external induced method (e.g., vibration or pressure), it is possible to fabricate Q-CFECs at low filler loadings. The Q-CFECs holds promise for achieving 4 K thermal conductivity comparable to that of stainless steel while preserving moldability before curing.
