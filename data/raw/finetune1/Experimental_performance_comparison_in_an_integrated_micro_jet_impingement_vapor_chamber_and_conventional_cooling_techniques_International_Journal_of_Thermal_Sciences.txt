Abstract
The rapid rise in chip power density demands cooling solutions balancing flow resistance, heat transfer efficiency, and temperature uniformity. To address this, an integrated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (IMJIVC) heat dissipation system is developed by combining jet impingement with a vapor chamber, offering a novel integration beyond conventional standalone designs. Comparative experiments were conducted against a separated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (SMJIVC) heat dissipation system, a standalone array micro jet impingement (MJI) heat sink, and a conventional microchannel (MC) heat sink. Results show that the IMJIVC significantly outperforms the SMJIVC, achieving an 18.54 %-21.91 % higher Nusselt number (Nu), a 16.25 % greater allowable heating power (463.22 W at 3.0 L/min flow rate), a 17.76 %–22.46 % lower maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax), and an 18 %–22 % improvement in performance evaluation criterion (PEC). Compared to the MJI, the IMJIVC exhibits similar flow performance but superior temperature uniformity (35.38 %–37.96 % lower ΔTmax), despite moderate decreases in heat transfer (6.77 %–13.10 % decreased Nu) and comprehensive performance (IMJIVC/MJI PEC value is 0.87–0.94). Relative to the MC, IMJIVC reduced Nu by 11 %–15 % but offered 49.01 %–71.11 % lower pressure drop, 51.42 %–55.25 % better temperature uniformity, and 8 %–35 % higher PEC. These findings demonstrate that although IMJIVC does not maximize heat transfer like MJI or MC, it delivers the most favorable trade-off among flow resistance, heat transfer, and temperature uniformity. The IMJIVC therefore represents a promising cooling solution for next-generation high heat flux electronics.

1. Introduction
The rapid proliferation of intelligent computing systems, particularly those employing large language models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, has precipitated unprecedented demands for data processing and computing power capabilities [1,2]. This trend has significantly intensified thermal management challenges, as the associated rise in power density results in a substantial increase in chip heat flux density [3], defined as the thermal power dissipated per unit area. This surge has resulted in a sharp increase in chip heat flux density [3], as shown by the data presented in Fig. 1.

As evidenced by the increasing trend in chip heat flux density illustrated in Fig. 1, modern high-power electronic chips have already exceeded 100 W/cm2 [4,5], a widely recognized threshold for high heat flux conditions [6], and may even approach values as high as 500 W/cm2 in specific applications [7]. According to Moore's law, which describes the exponential advancement of semiconductor and microelectronic technologies [8], chip heat flux densities are expected to continue rising, potentially surpassing 1000 W/cm2 in the foreseeable future [9]. This trend implies a corresponding increase in chip operating temperatures, which, if not properly managed, can severely compromise the stability, reliability, lifespan, and safety of server chips [10]. Consequently, developing effective thermal management solutions for high-performance chips within the limited space of server systems is of critical importance.
The relentless advancement of semiconductor technology has driven chip heat flux densities beyond 100 W/cm2, rendering conventional thermal management strategies increasingly inadequate. Traditional air-based cooling, including passive natural convection using metal fins and active forced-air cooling with fan-assisted fins, offers limited heat removal capacities (<20 W/cm2). Phase-change heat pipe technologies extend this capacity to approximately 90 W/cm2, still falling short of the requirements for high heat flux chips. Immersion liquid cooling (≤150 W/cm2) and single-phase microchannel liquid cooling (≤200 W/cm2) are gradually replacing air cooling as the primary thermal management solutions for high-power electronic devices [11], as illustrated in Fig. 2. Between these two cooling methods, single-phase microchannel liquid cooling has gained traction at the chip level due to its compactness and technological maturity.

However, although widely adopted as a mature chip cooling solution, microchannel cooling systems are inherently constrained by two fundamental limitations [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. First is the intrinsic trade-off between heat transfer and hydraulic performance [12,13]. Decreasing the hydraulic diameter improves convective heat transfer by intensifying turbulence and thinning the thermal boundary layer. Yet, this simultaneously leads to significantly higher flow resistance, necessitating substantially greater pumping power. Wang et al. [13] studied the thermal and performance of microchannels with identical cross-sectional areas but differing geometries (rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal). The result shows that microchannels with smaller hydraulic diameters or higher aspect ratios exhibit lower thermal resistance but significantly increased pressure drops. This geometric sensitivity highlights the difficulty of achieving an optimal balance between thermal performance and energy efficiency, even in optimized microchannel designs.
Second, microchannel cooling inherently suffers from axial temperature gradients due to unidirectional coolant flow [14,15]. As the working fluid flows through the channel and continuously absorbs heat, a significant temperature disparity emerges between the inlet (upstream) and outlet (downstream) regions, commonly resulting in elevated outlet temperatures. This thermal non-uniformity increases the risk of localized overheating and thermal runaway, thereby compromising chip reliability. Adham et al. [14] and Kingston et al. [15] investigated the heat transfer characteristics of various cross-sectional geometries, including rectangular, trapezoidal, and triangular shapes. Their studies revealed that the progressive thickening of thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers along the flow direction leads to a decline in heat transfer efficiency and an increase in the base surface temperature, ultimately reducing the overall cooling performance.
To alleviate axial thermal non-uniformity in microchannel cooling, hybrid thermal management solutions that combine a microchannel module with a vapor chamber (VC) have been explored for high-power chip applications [16,17], as illustrated in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Schematic of a hybrid microchannel vapor chamber cooling system [16,17].

Serving as flat heat pipes [18], VC employs a phase-change mechanism to redistribute heat laterally and reduce temperature gradients [[19], [20], [21]]. However, these hybrid configurations involve multilayer assemblies incorporating thermal interface materials (TIMs) between the chip, vapor chamber, and microchannel module. The presence of these interfaces introduces additional contact thermal resistance, thereby diminishing heat transfer performance [16]. Furthermore, despite the added lateral spreading capability, the heat transfer efficiency of these hybrid systems remains constrained by the inherent geometrical constraints of microchannels.
In response, considerable research has shifted toward exploring novel coolants and MC designs to enhance microscale thermal performance. For example, pin fin micro heat sink achieves very low thermal resistances, comparable MC convective flows [22]. Manda et al. [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27]] investigated supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as a working fluid, showing that its high specific heat capacity and low viscosity enable superior heat transfer, while near-critical effects further intensify thermal transport. Moreover, near-critical effects were shown to further intensify thermal transport. At the geometric level, cross-sectional variations strongly influence performance: triangular channels increase heat transfer by over 50 % compared with circular ones, and star-shaped designs show the best overall results [28,29]. Additional factors such as buoyancy effects in horizontal sCO2 microchannels [30] and comparative studies of fluids like ammonia versus sCO2 [31] further underscore the trade-offs among efficiency, toxicity, and integration potential.
Despite these advances, most investigations remain confined to idealized conditions or single-factor analyses. In practical high-heat-flux chip cooling, confined spaces, multilayer components, and thermal interfaces continue to hinder the realization of efficient, uniform, and low-resistance thermal management. Overcoming the inherent trade-off between heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop is thus critical, underscoring the need for alternative liquid cooling technologies. As depicted in Fig. 2, jet impingement and spray cooling technologies demonstrate markedly superior convective heat transfer performance, outperforming even two-phase microchannel cooling configurations [17,32]. Jet impingement cooling is particularly attractive due to its structural simplicity and system compactness [32,33], as spray cooling involves liquid atomization and dispersion processes that require additional space to accommodate the spraying apparatus [32,34,35]. Furthermore, in contrast to other liquid cooling technologies, jet impingement cooling features significantly higher cooling capacity, lower pressure drop and reduced pumping power requirements [[36], [37], [38], [39]]. These advantages render jet impingement cooling a highly promising and practical solution for addressing the thermal challenges of high heat flux chips in space-constrained environments.
Despite the performance benefits of conventional microchannel and hybrid microchannel-vapor chamber configurations, their overall heat transfer capabilities remain constrained by the microchannel geometric scale. To address this, the present study proposes an integrated “micro jet impingement + vapor chamber” (IMJIVC) heat dissipation system. This hybrid architecture combines high-efficiency heat extraction via micro jet impingement with rapid lateral heat spreading enabled by the vapor chamber's phase-change mechanism, thereby enhancing both cooling performance and temperature uniformity.
Preliminary study on separated “micro jet impingement + vapor chamber” (SMJIVC) heat dissipation system has demonstrated promising outcomes [40], including a 22 % reduction in pressure drop and a 35 % improvement in temperature uniformity compared to conventional separated “microchannel cooling + vapor chamber” hydraulic configuration [40]. However, this separated system still suffers from interfacial thermal resistances caused by multilayer assemblies incorporating TIMs. In the present design, the IMJIVC addresses this limitation by structurally integrating the impingement surface of the micro jet impingement module with the condenser surface of the vapor chamber into a single component. This integration establishes a direct thermal pathway, enabling heat generated by the heat source to be transmitted directly from the vapor chamber to the micro jet impingement module without traversing the TIM interface. Previous studies have shown that such interfacial resistance can account for 13.1–19.2 % of the total thermal resistance [40].
By synergistically combining the high convective removal capability of micro jet impingement with the rapid lateral heat spreading of vapor chamber, the proposed IMJIVC heat dissipation system provides a compact and high-performance cooling solution tailored for high heat flux applications. This integrated design not only improves thermal and hydraulic performance but also facilitates improved spatial integration, making it well-suited for the confined architectures of modern electronic systems.
To comprehensively assess its thermal management potential, the IMJIVC heat dissipation system is benchmarked against three representative cooling strategies: (1) a separated composite heat dissipation system to assess the benefits of structural integration; (2) a standalone array micro jet impingement (MJI) heat sink to evaluate the VC contribution to temperature uniformity; and (3) a conventional microchannel (MC) heat sink (mature chip cooling technology) to demonstrate improvements in temperature uniformity, and comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance. These comparative analyses aim to establish the IMJIVC as a promising candidate for next-generation thermal management in high-density computing environments, with particular relevance to high-power server chips or AI accelerators.
2. Experiments
To validate the performance advantages of the IMJIVC heat dissipation system, this section details the design and fabrication of the IMJIVC prototype, along with three comparative systems (SMJIVC, MJI, and MC). The experimental setup, performance evaluation metrics, and uncertainty analysis methods are also introduced.
2.1. Design of IMJIVC heat dissipation system
This study focuses on the thermal management of an Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2697 v3 server CPU (central processing unit), which features an integrated heat spreader (IHS) with a top surface area of 45.5 × 36.74 mm2. The CPU is rated at a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 145 W, and the maximum allowable case temperature, Tcase, of the CPU is 76.7 °C.
The proposed heat dissipation solution, an integrated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (IMJIVC) heat dissipation system, is dimensioned to match the IHS surface. The IMJIVC heat dissipation system integrates a micro jet impingement module (equipped with nozzle arrays) with a VC in a vertically stacked configuration, as depicted in Fig. 4(a). The micro jet impingement module is constructed in a layered arrangement (from top to bottom) consisting of a cover, a jet plate, and an impingement condenser serving dual roles as the impingement target for high-velocity coolant jets and the VC condenser. The VC consists of an evaporator thermally coupled to the CPU via thermal interface material (TIM) for direct heat absorption, a copper foam wick structure to enhance capillary-driven liquid replenishment, an impingement condenser, and an injection pipe for delivering the phase-change cooling medium. Sealing gaskets are installed between these layers to prevent leakage and ensure that all the cooling water is effectively ejected through the nozzle array. The entire assembly is secured using screws and nuts, with inlet and outlet pipe joints provided to facilitate integration into an external water-cooling system.

The cover of IMJIVC functions as a supplementary structural component with simplified geometry, incorporating an inlet, an outlet, and four alignment holes. A sealed interface between the cover and jet plate (achieved via gaskets) forms parallel flow channels to direct coolant toward the nozzle array. As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the jet plate, with dimensions of 89 × 66 × 2 mm3 to match the VC, features an outlet, four through-holes, and a flow distribution chamber divided into five parallel channels supplying a 5 × 5 nozzle array (nozzle number n is 25). Each nozzle has a diameter of 1.0 mm and a nozzle-to-nozzle spacing of 11.0 mm (d = 1.0 mm, Sn = 11.0 mm). Key jet impingement structure parameters of IMJIVC are detailed in Fig. 4(c), including d, n, Sn, and the jet nozzle to impingement condenser Yn (Yn is set as 3.0 mm, Yn = 3.0 mm). The cover, micro jet plate, and impingement condenser are processed by the computer numerical control (CNC) machining method. To ensure high heat dissipation efficiency, all machined plates are made of oxygen-free copper. The main structures, dimensions, and fabrication process of VC in the present study are consistent with our previous work in Ref. [16], with the prototype shown in Fig. 4(d).
During operation, the IMJIVC heat dissipation system is mounted directly on the heat-generating CPU with TIM optimizing interfacial thermal contact. CPU-generated heat transfers through the TIM to the evaporator and copper foam wick. The working fluid of VC absorbed by the wick rapidly vaporizes upon heating, filling the sealed cavity formed by the evaporator and the impingement condenser. Vapor condenses on the cooler condenser surface (Fig. 4(a) and (d), upper surface), releasing latent heat to the impingement surface of the micro jet impingement module. Concurrently, circulating coolant enters the IMJIVC heat dissipation system through the inlet, accelerates through the nozzle array of the jet plate, and generates a micro jet array within the cavity enclosed by the jet plate and the impingement condenser. The micro jets impinge on the impingement surface (inner surface of the impingement condenser), spread laterally, and then exit via the outlet pipe joint. The heat conducted from the CPU to the impingement condenser is effectively removed by the impinging liquid jets and lateral coolant flow. The condensed working fluid on the lower surface of the impingement condenser is recirculated back to the VC evaporator via synergistic gravity and wick-driven capillary action.
2.2. Design of comparative groups
2.2.1. SMJIVC heat dissipation system
The integrated design of the composite heat dissipation system theoretically mitigates the contact thermal resistance associated with multi-component configurations. To experimentally validate the performance benefits of the integrated design against the IMJIVC heat dissipation system, a separated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (SMJIVC) heat dissipation system is developed as a comparative group, as shown in Fig. 5. The SMJIVC consists of a micro jet impingement module and a separated VC, and it is derived by modifying the IMJIVC impingement condenser (Fig. 4 (a)) into two discrete components: an impingement plate serving as the target for impinging jets and a condenser for VC. Key jet impingement geometric parameters, including the nozzle diameter (d = 1.0 mm), nozzle number (n = 25), nozzle-to-nozzle spacing (Sn = 11.0 mm), and nozzle-to-target distance (Yn = 3.0 mm), are maintained identical to those in the IMJIVC design.

2.2.2. MJI heat sink
To evaluate the contribution of the vapor chamber (VC) to temperature uniformity, a standalone micro jet impingement (MJI) heat sink with an array configuration was developed, as depicted in Fig. 6. Key jet impingement geometric parameters, including the nozzle diameter (d = 1.0 mm), nozzle number (n = 25), nozzle-to-nozzle spacing (Sn = 11.0 mm), and nozzle-to-target distance (Yn = 3.0 mm), remain consistent with the IMJIVC. Silicone gaskets and screw-fastened assembly ensure structural integrity and leak-free operation. During operation, coolant enters the MJI heat sink through the inlet pipe joint and is driven by pressure through the nozzle array of the jet plate. Inside the jet chamber (formed by the cover, the sealing gasket, and the impingement plate) resulting micro jet array impinges onto the impingement surface (inner surface of the impingement plate), forming lateral flow that carries away heat from the heat source before exiting through the outlet pipe joint.

2.2.3. MC heat sink
Single-phase microchannel liquid cooling is the existing mature chip cooling technology. For benchmarking against conventional cooling of CPU chip, a conventional microchannel (MC) heat sink is designed with direct structural correspondence to the micro jet impingement module of IMJIVC, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The MC retains the IMJIVC cover (89 × 66 × 2 mm3) and silicone sealing gasket but replaces the nozzle array with a microchannel plate containing a fluid distribution chamber, 25 parallel rectangular channels (50 × 1 × 1 mm3), a fluid collection chamber, and four alignment through-holes. Screw-fastened assembly ensures leak-free integration with external coolant loops via inlet and outlet pipe joints. The microchannel height (1.0 mm) matches the IMJIVC nozzle depth to maintain equivalent flow resistance and heat transfer surface area. During operation, heat generated by the CPU is transferred through thermal grease to the microchannel plate. Meanwhile, coolant enters through the inlet pipe joint, is distributed by a fluid distribution chamber, and then rapidly flows through the parallel micro channels. The forced convective flow efficiently extracts heat from the micro channel plate surface via enhanced thermal boundary layer disruption. The heated coolant subsequently converges in the fluid collection chamber and returns to the external cooling loop through the outlet pipe joint.

2.3. Performance test
2.3.1. Test facility description
The schematic diagram for the IMJIVC performance test is illustrated in Fig. 8, which consists of a coolant module, a heating module, and a data acquisition module. The closed-loop coolant circulation module is designed to extract heat from the IMJIVC through forced convective cooling. It comprises a reservoir, a water pump, a thermostatic water tank, a flowmeter, the tested heat dissipation system, and a liquid cooling device, all connected in sequence by polyurethane (PU) pipes. Deionized water is circulated by the pump into the IMJIVC, where it absorbs heat, and is subsequently cooled by the liquid cooling device before returning to the reservoir. The cooling water is preheated to 30 °C by flowing through a copper coil placed in the thermostatic water tank before entering the IMJIVC. After heat absorption, the cooling fluid is cooled to ambient temperature via a plate heat exchanger coupled with a chiller. The flow rate is regulated using a flowmeter within the range of 1.0–3.0 L/min.

Fig. 8. Schematic diagram of IMJIVC performance test setup.

The heating module is designed to simulate the thermal load of an Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2697 v3 server CPU chip. It consists of a DC (direct current) stabilized power supply and a heating assembly, including a heating copper block (top surface area is 47.5 × 39 mm2), five 100 W cartridge-type DC heating rods embedded within the coppe block and a Bakelite shell with thermal conductivity below 0.1 W/(m·K). The heating power is controlled by the DC stabilized power supply. The copper block is coupled to the IMJIVC via a 0.5 mm thermal grease layer to ensure efficient heat transfer. Heat generated by the DC heating rods is conducted through the heating copper block to the IMJIVC, with thermal losses minimized using silicone foam insulation with thermal conductivity less than 0.3 W/(m·K) [41].
The data acquisition module is employed to monitor and record experimental parameters, including pressure and temperature. Pressure measurements at the IMJIVC inlet and outlet joints are obtained using pressure transmitters, a data acquisition unit, and a computer. A total of thirteen K-type thermocouples are installed at IMJIVC inlet and outlet, five designated points Ti (i = 1,2,3,4,5) on the heating copper block, four locations on the VC evaporator (T10-T40), and two points on the impingement surface (T50-T60). All pressure and temperature signals are sampled at a frequency of 1.0 Hz using the data acquisition instruments and transferred to the computer for real-time monitoring and analysis.
Based on the schematic diagram (Fig. 8), the physical test facility of the IMJIVC is constructed, as illustrated in Fig. 9. Cooling water is pumped from the reservoir by a gear pump into the circulation loop, sequentially passing through a thermostatic water tank, needle valve (flow regulation), turbine flow meter (flow measurement), IMJIVC heat dissipation system, pressure transmitter (pressure monitoring), and plate heat exchange. The cooled water ultimately returns to the reservoir to form a closed loop. Specific information on the devices used to build the IMJIVC heat dissipation system performance test platform is shown in Table 1.

To minimize parasitic heat loss and ensure measurement accuracy, the PU pipes between the temperature measurement points at the IMJIVC inlet and outlet were wrapped with multi-layer insulation cotton. Coolant temperatures at the inlet and outlet were measured using K-type thermocouples, with one end securely bonded to predrilled ports on the pipes to ensure full fluid contact, and the other end connected to the data acquisition system.
The temperatures of the heating copper block (heat source) measurement points were recorded by soldering one end of each K-type thermocouple to the copper block using solder paste, ensuring secure attachment and accurate readings. For the VC, the outer surface of the evaporator was measured using K-type thermocouples, which were pressed tightly against the surface by spring-loaded pins on the heating assembly. Additionally, the surface temperatures of the impingement condenser were recorded using adhesive-mounted K-type thermocouples. The thermocouple connections and interface details for the heating assembly and VC are shown in Fig. 10.

2.3.2. Operating conditions
All experiments were conducted under controlled conditions with an ambient temperature of 25 °C and a coolant inlet temperature of 30 °C. The independent variables studied include flow rate (ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 L/min, with increments of 0.4 L/min) and heating power (ranging from 195 to 315 W, with increments of 30 W).
The baseline heating power was set at 195 W, and at each power level, the flow rate was gradually increased from 1.0 L/min, with steps of 0.4 L/min up to 3.0 L/min. Once the experimental circuit stabilized, the data acquisition system was activated to observe the output data. Data were collected and recorded when the temperature variation at the measurement point was less than 0.1 °C and the pressure variation was less than 10 Pa. During data recording, to minimize errors, the arithmetic mean of the temperature data over 30 s of stable fluctuation at the temperature measurement point was used, and the arithmetic mean of the pressure data over 15 s of stable fluctuation at the pressure measurement point was used.
After completing a flow rate sequence, the heating power was increased by 30 W (e.g., from 195 W to 225 W), and the flow rate was reset to the initial 1.0 L/min. This process was repeated until the maximum heating power setting of 315 W was reached, completing the performance testing of the IMJIVC heat dissipation system.
2.4. Performance evaluation metric
The IMJIVC heat dissipation system and its comparison groups (SMJIVC, MJI, and MC) were systematically compared in terms of flow performance, heat transfer performance, temperature difference performance, and comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance.
2.4.1. Flow performance
The flow characteristic of the tested heat dissipation systems was evaluated by the inlet-to-outlet pressure drop Δp. A lower Δp indicates reduced flow resistance and enhanced hydraulic efficiency, thereby minimizing pump power consumption P. Δp and P are calculated as follows [42]:

2.4.2. Heat transfer performance
To assess the heat dissipation capability of various cooling methods, key metrics such as wall temperature, overall Nusselt number (Nu), heat transfer coefficient (h), and total thermal resistance (R) are used to determine whether the heat dissipation system meets temperature control and heat flux requirements. In this experiment, wall temperature parameters include the heat source surface temperature, the VC evaporator surface temperature, and the impingement surface temperature, comprising both the impingement condenser inner surface and the impingement plate inner surface. The heat source surface temperature (Th) is calculated using the method described in Ref. [43], based on thermocouple measurements at designated locations on the heating copper block, as shown in Fig. 11. The calculation is as follows:

where d is the hydraulic diameter and Kf is the coolant thermal conductivity.
2.4.3. Temperature uniformity
Temperature uniformity of the heat dissipation system is quantified by the maximum temperature difference of the heat source ΔTmax. The smaller 
 value, the better temperature uniformity. ΔTmax is calculated from the measured temperatures at five heat source surface points Th,i (i = 1,2,3,4,5) in Fig. 11:
(13)
2.4.4. Comprehensive performance
When comparing different cooling schemes, relying solely on heat transfer or flow performance indicators cannot comprehensively evaluate the flow resistance and heat removal effect. To address this, the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is introduced as a comprehensive performance evaluation index of flow and heat transfer [46], and its calculation formula is as follows:
(14)
where he and Pe are the heat transfer coefficient and pump power consumption of the evaluated scheme, and href and Pref are the heat transfer coefficient and pump power consumption of the reference scheme. The PEC reflects the relative comprehensive performance of the evaluated scheme compared to the reference scheme. When the PEC value is less than 1.0, it indicates that the comprehensive performance of the evaluated scheme is worse than the reference scheme, and when the PEC value is greater than 1.0, it indicates that the evaluated scheme has better comprehensive performance than the reference scheme.
2.4.5. Uncertainty analysis
To evaluate the overall uncertainty throughout the measurement process, it is essential to consider the measurement range and accuracy of the flowmeter, pressure transmitter, K-type thermocouple, data acquisition system, thermostatic water tank, DC stabilized power supply, and other relevant instruments and equipment. The uncertainties in pressure and temperature measurements arise from two primary sources: random errors caused by repeated experiments and instrument-related errors that vary with the measured values, such as those from the pressure transmitter, K-type thermocouple, and liquid thermostat.
The uncertainty caused by measurement repeatability can be calculated using the following equation [47,48]:
(15)
where 
 is the arithmetic mean of the sample, 
, 
 represents individual observations, and n is the number of repetitions. In this study, each measurement result is obtained by averaging three readings, n = 3.
The uncertainty introduced by processing equipment or experimental instruments is calculated according to the following formula [47]:
(16)
Assuming a uniform distribution of manufacturing tolerances and measurement values, and a confidence level of 68.3 %, the uncertainty can be estimated accordingly. For instance, if the CNC machining accuracy is within 0.02 mm, the maximum dimensional uncertainty calculated using Eq. (16) is 0.012 mm. The uncertainties of the experimental instruments used are summarized in Table 1.
The uncertainty in each calculated value from equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) is evaluated using the Kline and McClintock method [49], expressed as:
(17)
where Xi represents each measured value, Y is the result calculated from these measured values, and σXi denotes the uncertainty associated with each Xi. σXi is calculated using the formula provided in Ref. [48]:
(18)
Based on equations (15), (16), (17), (18), the maximum uncertainties of the calculated values in the performance test of the IMJIVC heat dissipation system are summarized in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion
The following sections present and analyse the performance of the proposed IMJIVC heat dissipation system in comparison with its counterparts (SMJIVC, MJI, and MC). Flow characteristic is evaluated in terms of pressure drop (Δp) and pump power consumption (P). Heat transfer performance is characterized using the average heat source temperature (Th), thermal resistance (R), convective heat transfer coefficient (h), and Nusselt number (Nu). Temperature uniformity is assessed by the maximum temperature difference of the heat source (ΔTmax), and a performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is employed to provide a comprehensive metric of flow and heat transfer.
3.1. Flow performance
The flow performance comparison of the IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC is illustrated in Fig. 13. As flow rate increases, pressure drop (Δp) and pump power consumption (P) of all four cooling systems (IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC) rise at an accelerating rate due to increased coolant velocity. According to the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the pressure loss along the flow path is proportional to the square of the mean velocity, so higher velocities produce disproportionately larger pressure drops. Moreover, from Eq. (2), an increased pressure drop (Δp) directly translates into higher pump power consumption (P). Consequently, at higher inlet flow rates, all four cooling systems experience not only larger pressure drops but also increased pump power consumption.

It can also be seen in Fig. 13 that the IMJIVC, SMJIVC, and MJI heat dissipation systems exhibit nearly indistinguishable pressure drop (Δp) and pump power consumption (P) across the tested flow rate range of 1.0–3.0 L/min. The reason for this similarity is that Δp is primarily governed by local flow-induced losses under consistent experimental setups and inlet flow rate conditions. Since the structure of the solids in contact with the fluid and the flow paths are the same in all three systems, the resistance to flow remains practically constant. Relative to the SMJIVC, the IMJIVC exhibited Δp and P deviations within 3.19 % across the tested flow rate range. Specifically, the IMJIVC demonstrates slightly lower values at 1.4, 1.8, and 2.2 L/min by 1.82 %, 0.55 %, and 1.32 %, and marginally higher values at 2.6 and 3.0 L/min by 3.19 % and 2.37 %. These minor and non-monotonic differences indicate comparable hydraulic performance between the IMJIVC and SMJIVC, with differences primarily attributed to fabrication tolerances and measurement uncertainties. Similarly, compared to the MJI, the IMJIVC exhibited a 3.45 % reduction in both Δp and P at a 1.4 L/min flow rate but slightly higher values (within 3.03 %) at other flow rates. These subtle discrepancies further reflect the influence of manufacturing tolerances and experimental variability.
In addition, the IMJIVC demonstrates significantly lower Δp and P values than the MC, with experimental results showing reductions ranging from 49.01 % to 71.11 %. This highlights the superior flow performance of IMJIVC. As reported in our previous work [16], this improvement is mainly attributed to the lower coolant velocity in IMJIVC. According to the Darcy-Weisbach equation and Eq. (2), the pressure drop (Δp) is proportional to the square of the flow velocity. As a result, higher flow velocity induces disproportionately larger Δp and P. Hence, the flow characteristics of the IMJIVC are significantly improved compared to the microchannel (MC) heat sink.
3.2. Heat transfer performance
Fig. 14 compares the heat transfer performance of the IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC at 30 °C inlet coolant temperature and 225 W heating power. As shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b), the heat source temperature (Th) and total thermal resistance (R) decrease asymptotically towards steady state values with increasing flow rate. This trend is primarily attributed to enhanced convective heat transfer resulting from higher fluid velocity, which thins the thermal boundary layer and reduces convective resistance [16]. Similar phenomena have been widely reported in prior studies [16,45,51]. Specifically, the heat transfer trends of IMJIVC and SMJIVC are consistent with those reported in Ref. [45] for integrated and separated jet-vapor chamber heat sinks, while those of MJI and MC correspond to jet array cooler in Ref. [51] and simple MC heat sink in Ref. [16], respectively. Although absolute values differ due to geometric and operating condition variations, the consistent trend of decreasing Th and R with increasing flow rate validates the reliability of the present experimental data. The reduction in total thermal resistance (R) leads to an increase in both heat transfer coefficient (h) and Nusselt number (Nu), as shown in Fig. 14(c) and (d). However, beyond a certain flow rate, conductive thermal resistance becomes the dominant component of the total thermal resistance [16], thereby diminishing the rates of heat source temperature (Th) and total thermal resistance (R), and increasing the rates of heat transfer coefficient (h) and Nusselt number (Nu).

Within the tested flow rate range of 1.0–3.0 L/min, Fig. 14(a) shows that the average heat source temperature (Th) of the IMJIVC is consistently lower than that of the SMJIVC, indicating its enhanced heat transfer characteristic. This enhancement stems directly from the integrated design of the IMJIVC, which eliminates the interfacial contact thermal resistance between the impingement plate of the micro jet impingement module and the condenser of VC in the separated SMJIVC configuration [40]. As a result, the IMJIVC achieves significantly lower total thermal resistance (R) (Fig. 14(b)), enabling more efficient heat removal from the heat source to the coolant [16,50]. This improvement directly translates to improved heat transfer efficiency, as demonstrated by the data of heat transfer coefficient (h) and overall Nusselt number (Nu), as depicted in (Fig. 14(c)) and (Fig. 14(d). Experimental data show an average heat source temperature (Th) difference of 4.92–6.36 °C between IMJIVC and SMJIVC, representing a relative Th reduction of 8.07–9.15 % for IMJIVC. Additionally, the IMJIVC achieves a 15.65 %–17.98 % reduction in R values and an 18.54 %–21.91 % improvement in both h and Nu values. These results confirm the enhanced thermal management capability of IMJIVC under the same operating conditions. Pan et al. [16] experimentally demonstrated that an integrated composite heat sink outperforms its separated counterpart, aligning with the present conclusions and further validating the reliability of our results.
Furthermore, Fig. 14(a)–(b), and Fig. 14(d) compare the present IMJIVC with the integrated jet-VC composite heat sinks (IJVC-0.8 and IJVC-3.0) reported in Ref. [45] at a heating power of 255 W. The IMJIVC achieves a lower average heat source temperature (Th), smaller thermal resistance (R), and higher Nusselt number (Nu) compared with IJVC-0.8 and IJVC-3.0. These results collectively demonstrate the enhanced heat transfer performance of the proposed IMJIVC.
The heat transfer benefits of IMJIVC over SMJIVC can be directly observed by its more uniform and reduced temperature distribution across all major heat transfer surfaces, including the heat source surface, VC evaporator, and impingement surfaces. Specifically, in addition to the lower heat source temperature shown in Fig. 14(a), the IMJIVC also achieves reduced VC evaporator and impingement surface temperatures compared to the SMJIVC, as illustrated in Fig. 15. Quantitatively, the VC evaporator temperature is reduced by 4.00–5.25 °C (8.65 %–9.83 %), while the impingement surface temperature decreases by 1.14–1.94 °C (2.63 %–3.91 %). The reductions in all critical thermal interface temperatures clearly validate the superior heat dissipation capabilities of the integrated configuration.

Fig. 14 also compares the heat transfer performance of IMJIVC heat dissipation system and standalone micro jet impingement (MJI) heat sink over the flow rate range of 1.0–3.0 L/min. The IMJIVC heat source temperature curve lies above the MJI as shown in Fig. 14(a), indicating a relatively lower heat transfer performance. Experimental data reveal that the Th value of IMJIVC exceeds MJI by 2.62–3.54 °C (4.33 %–6.74 %). This modest heat transfer performance is primarily attributed to the additional thermal resistance introduced by the VC module in the IMJIVC structure. This phenomenon is further confirmed by other key heat transfer performance metrics. As presented in Fig. 14(b)–(c), and Fig. 14(d), compared to the MJI, the total thermal resistance (R) of IMJIVC increased by 7.26 %–15.07 %, and the heat transfer coefficient (h) and the Nusselt number (Nu) both decreased by 6.77 %–13.10 %. Additional evidence is provided by the comparison of impingement surface temperature in Fig. 16. The impingement surface temperature of IMJIVC is slightly higher than that of MJI. Based on experimental data, the impingement surface temperature of the IMJIVC is only 1.26–1.47 °C higher than that of the MJI, corresponding to a relative increase of 2.98 %–3.71 %. These results highlight the modest heat transfer losses introduced by the VC module in the IMJIVC heat dissipation system, underscoring the trade-off between enhanced temperature uniformity and increased thermal resistance. Comparative tests in Ref. [16] also suggest that standalone MC cooler without a VC delivers better heat transfer capability than integrated composite heat sink.

Similarly, Fig. 14 compares the heat transfer performance of IMJIVC with that of the microchannel (MC) heat sink. Under identical test conditions, the IMJIVC exhibits a slightly higher average heat source temperature (Th) than the MC, as revealed in Fig. 14(a). Quantitatively, the temperature difference between the two cooling systems ranges from 4.01 °C to 4.78 °C (7.70 %–8.93 %), indicating a minor performance gap. This is attributable to the fact that coolant flowing through the MC attains a higher velocity than the jet velocity in the IMJIVC, thereby enabling more efficient heat removal (detailed in Section 3.1). Corroborating this trend, the IMJIVC demonstrates 12.39–16.97 % higher thermal resistance (R) and 11.03–14.57 % lower heat transfer coefficient (h) than the MC across the flow rate range (1.0–3.0 L/min), as presented in Fig. 14(b) and (c).
The overall Nusselt number (Nu) for IMJIVC and MJI was calculated using Eq. (12). For the IMJIVC, the hydraulic diameter (d) was taken as the jet nozzle diameter, while for the MC, the equivalent hydraulic diameter of the rectangular microchannels (dmc) was determined by dmc = 2hmcwmc/(hmc + wmc), where hmc and wmc are the MC height and width [40]. Fig. 14(d) compares the experimentally calculated Nu values for both cooling schemes over the 1.0–3.0 L/min flow rate range. The IMJIVC consistently exhibits lower Nu values than the MC, further confirming its relatively weaker heat transfer capability. Specifically, the Nu values for the IMJIVC are approximately 11.03 %–14.51 % lower than those of the MC, underscoring the slightly reduced thermal performance of the integrated design.
In practical applications, CPU chips rarely operate continuously under peak thermal loads. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the cooling systems under varying heating power levels. To assess thermal management under extreme conditions, all four heat dissipation systems were tested under heating powers ranging from 195 to 315 W (Fig. 17), exceeding the CPU's thermal design power (TDP) of 145 W. The average heat source temperatures of the IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC increase linearly with rising heating power, indicating constant thermal resistance and confirming that it is independent of input power [51]. At a fixed flow rate, higher input power results in increased heat source temperatures and a gradual decline in heat transfer efficiency. The linear relationship highlights the importance of effective thermal management strategies to prevent excessive temperature escalation when operating under high-power scenarios.

To quantitatively evaluate whether the operating temperature remains within the safe limits, linear regression analysis was conducted on the experimental data using the least squares method via the Fitting module in Origin's Analysis suite. The coefficient of determination (R2), ranging from 0 to 1, was used to quantify the goodness of fit, where higher R2 values indicate better predictive accuracy. As depicted in Fig. 17, the R2 values for IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC at a flow rate of 3.0 L/min are 0.994, 0.986, 0.998, and 0.998, respectively, confirming that the linear models reliably capture the relationship between heating power and average heat source temperature.
Furthermore, the slope of the regression line offers a quantitative measure of a cooling system's sensitivity to increasing thermal load, with a shallower slope indicating higher heat dissipation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 17, the SMJIVC exhibits the steepest slope (0.110), followed by the IMJIVC (0.101), MJI (0.0944), and MC (0.0906), suggesting that the IMJIVC exhibits lower thermal resistance than the SMJIVC, but slightly inferior heat dissipation capability compared to the MJI and MC. Based on the regression models in Fig. 17, the maximum allowable heating power required to maintain the average heat source temperature below the Tcase of 76.7 °C was calculated. At 3.0 L/min flow rate, the IMJIVC sustains 463.22 W maximum allowable heating power, 16.25 % higher than SMJIVC (398.48 W), but 10.08 % and 12.37 % lower than MJI (515.16 W) and MC (528.62 W). The results highlight the substantial performance improvement of the IMJIVC heat dissipation system over its separated counterpart (SMJIVC), while acknowledging a moderate trade-off in heat dissipation capacity relative to the standalone MJI and MC heat sinks.
3.3. Temperature uniformity
The maximum temperature difference of the heat source (ΔTmax) serves as a critical indicator of cooling system temperature uniformity. Even if the average temperature remains within acceptable limits, significant surface temperature gradients may lead to the formation of local hotspots, increasing the risk of thermal failure and undermining system reliability. A comprehensive comparison of ΔTmax among the four cooling configurations (IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC) under 255 W heating power and 1.0–3.0 L/min flow rate is presented in Fig. 18. The IMJIVC consistently demonstrates the lowest ΔTmax among all systems across the entire flow rate range, confirming its superior temperature uniformity. Specifically, the ΔTmax values for the IMJIVC range from 3.59 °C to 4.12 °C, corresponding to reductions of 0.89–1.04 °C (17.76 %–22.46 %) compared to the SMJIVC (4.63–5.01 °C), 2.07–2.41 °C (35.38 %–37.96 %) relative to the MJI (5.72–6.53 °C), and 4.24–4.78 °C (51.42 %–55.25 %) in comparison with the MC (7.91–8.79 °C).

The temperature uniformity advantage of the IMJIVC over the SMJIVC is primarily attributed to its integrated structure, which eliminates the contact thermal resistance produced by the interface between the jet impingement module and the VC. Relative to standalone MJI, the addition of a VC in the IMJIVC heat dissipation system further reduces surface temperature gradients due to its excellent thermal conductivity and temperature uniformity capabilities. Consequently, the IMJIVC outperforms the MJI in temperature uniformity. This observation is consistent with the findings of Pan et al. [16], who reported that the addition of a VC improves temperature uniformity relative to standalone cooling configuration. Compared to the conventional MC heat sink, where continuous coolant heating induces pronounced temperature gradients, the uniformly distributed jet array in IMJIVC mitigates streamwise thermal variations through impingement effects [40]. Moreover, the integrated VC further spreads heat laterally, reducing surface temperature differentials and enhancing overall uniformity.
Fig. 18 also compares the temperature uniformity of the IMJIVC with the IJVC-0.8 and IJVC-3.0 (integrated jet array-vapor chamber composite heat sinks) reported in Ref. [45] under a heating power of 255 W. As shown, the IMJIVC ΔTmax values are smaller than those of both IJVC-0.8 and IJVC-3.0, indicating superior temperature uniformity.
3.4. Comprehensive performance
The comprehensive performance of each cooling system is evaluated using the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) defined in Eq. (14) under equal pump power conditions. Fig. 19 presents the PEC of the IMJIVC relative to the SMJIVC, MJI, and MC at a heating power of 255 W and an inlet flow rate of 1.0–3.0 L/min.

Fig. 19. Comprehensive performance comparison among IMJIVC, SMJIVC, MJI, and MC.

As shown in Fig. 19, for IMJIVC versus SMJIVC, the PEC value fluctuates between 1.18 and 1.22, indicating an 18 %–22 % enhancement in cooling performance at equal pumping power. This result demonstrates the superior comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance of the integrated design. Based on the above comparative analysis of IMJIVC and SMJIVC, these two heat dissipation systems show a similar change trend in heat transfer performance. However, the IMJIVC presents lower thermal resistance, reduced average heat source temperature, higher maximum allowable heating power, and smaller maximum temperature difference. These improvements in heat transfer efficiency and temperature uniformity are in agreement with the experimental findings of Pan et al. [16]. Regarding the comparison with MJI, the IMJIVC/MJI PEC value is 0.87–0.94, reflecting a modest 6 %–13 % reduction in heat transfer performance (characterized by h and Nu) at the same power consumption. This modest penalty stems from the added thermal resistance of the VC. Hence, the integrated IMJIVC demonstrates marginally lower heat transfer performance than the standalone micro jet impingement system (MJI) under the same pumping conditions. Conversely, against the MC heat sink, the IMJIVC/MC PEC value ranges from 1.08 to 1.35 across the tested flow rates. This signifies an 8 %–35 % comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance advantage, attributable to the synergistic effects of high velocity jet impingement and the VC temperature uniformity. Therefore, the IMJIVC delivers superior heat transfer performance compared to the mature cooling technology of the server chip (MC heat sink) under equal pump power.
4. Conclusions and outlook
4.1. Conclusions
To validate the novelty and performance advantages of the proposed integrated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (IMJIVC) heat dissipation system, extensive experimental comparisons were conducted against three benchmark configurations: a separated micro jet impingement vapor chamber (SMJIVC) heat dissipation system, a standalone array micro jet impingement (MJI) heat sink, and a conventional microchannel (MC) heat sink representing the current mature chip cooling technology. The assessments were conducted within a flow rate range of 1.0–3.0 L/min under comparable thermal boundary conditions (195–315 w heating power), and were evaluated in terms of flow resistance, heat transfer, temperature uniformity, and comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance. The key findings are summarized as follows:
(1)
Compared to the SMJIVC, the IMJIVC exhibits significant advantages in heat transfer, temperature uniformity, and comprehensive performance while maintaining comparable flow performance. Within the tested flow rate range of 1.0–3.0 L/min, the IMJIVC achieves an 8.07 %–9.15 % reduction in average heat source temperature (Th), a 15.65 %–17.98 % decrease in total thermal resistance (R), an 18.54–21.91 % increase in both heat transfer coefficient (h) and Nusselt number (Nu), and a 17.76 %–22.46 % refuction in maximum temperature difference of heat source (ΔTmax). Based on a linear regression model, the IMJIVC can sustain a maximum allowable heating power of 463.22 W without exceeding the maximum allowable case temperature Tcase (76.7 °C) at 3.0 L/min flow rate, representing a 16.25 % improvement over the SMJIVC (398.48 W). Furthermore, the comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance is improved by 18 %–22 %, as the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) values of IMJIVC to SMJIVC are 1.18–1.22.
(2)
In comparison with the MJI, the IMJIVC maintains comparable flow character while delivering markedly enhanced temperature uniformity, despite exhibiting marginally lower heat transfer and comprehensive performance. Under identical test conditions, the IMJIVC shows a 4.33 %–6.74 % increase in average heat source temperature (Th) and a 7.26 %–15.07 % increase in thermal resistance (R). The heat transfer coefficient (h) and overall Nusselt number (Nu) decrease by 6.77 %–13.10 %. At a 3.0 L/min flow rate, the maximum allowable heating power is 463.22 W, representing a 10.08 % reduction compared to the MJI (515.16 W). The IMJIVC exhibits a modest 6 %–13 % reduction in comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance (the PEC value of IMJIVC/MJI is 0.87–0.94). However, the IMJIVC significantly reduces the maximum temperature difference of the heat source (ΔTmax) by 35.38 %–37.96 %, highlighting its excellent temperature uniformity.
(3)
Relative to the MC, the IMJIVC demonstrates significantly improved flow characteristics, superior temperature uniformity, and enhanced comprehensive performance, despite a slight reduction in heat transfer capability. Under the same test conditions, the IMJIVC exhibits a 7.70 %–8.93 % increase in Th, a 12.39 %–16.97 % increase in R, and an 11.03 %–14.51 % decrease in both h and Nu. At a flow rate of 3.0 L/min, the maximum allowable heating power of IMJIVC is 463.22 W, which is 12.37 % lower than that of the MC (528.62 W). However, the IMJIVC achieves substantial reductions in both pressure drop and pump power consumption (49.01 %–71.11 %), while significantly enhancing temperature uniformity, with the ΔTmax reduced by 51.42 %–55.25 %. In addition, the comprehensive flow and heat transfer performance of the IMJIVC is enhanced by 8 %–35 % compared to the MC (the PEC value of IMJIVC/MJI is 1.08–1.35).
The experimental results quantitatively confirm that the enhanced cooling capability of the MJI is achieved at the expense of temperature uniformity, whereas the superior heat transfer performance of the MC comes with significantly higher flow resistance and diminished temperature uniformity. In contrast, IMJIVC establishes an optimally balanced thermal management strategy, simultaneously ensuring low flow resistance, adequate heat transfer efficiency, and exceptional temperature uniformity. Rather than maximizing any single metric, IMJIVC strategically optimizes the trade-off among these three parameters. These findings position IMJIVC as a promising alternative to conventional microchannel and jet impingement technologies for next-generation electronics requiring efficient thermal management with uniform temperature distribution.
4.2. Limitations and outlook
While the present work demonstrates the advantages of the IMJIVC, several limitations remain. First, the experiments were performed under controlled laboratory conditions (coolant inlet temperature of 30 °C, flow rate range 1.0–3.0 L/min), which may not fully capture the variability in real electronic cooling environments. Second, the study focused on water as the working fluid, whereas alternative coolants (e.g., dielectric fluids or nanofluids) were not considered. Third, the IMJIVC configuration investigated here employed fixed nozzle geometries and wick structures, without optimization of parameters such as jet diameter, spacing, jet-to-surface distance, or vapor chamber wick design. As a result, although the system shows favorable trade-offs, its heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number remain lower than those of conventional MJI and MC at certain conditions.
Future research will therefore focus on addressing these limitations through: (1) systematic investigation of jet impingement parameters and wick structures; (2) integration of surface enhancement techniques (e.g., nanostructured wicks, microfins); (3) extension of the analysis to advanced coolants (e.g., nanofluids or dielectric fluids); and (4) derivation of empirical correlations linking heat transfer, flow resistance, and jet impingement parameters. These advancements will enhance both the predictive capability and practical applicability of integrated microjet impingement and vapor chamber (IMJIVC) technology for next-generation high-heat-flux thermal management.
