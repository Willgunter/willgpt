Space Shuttle Stiffener Ring Foam Failure Analysis, A Non-conventional Approach.
The Space Shuttle Program made use of the excellent properties of rigid polyurethane
foam for cryogenic tank insulation and as structural protection on the solid rocket
boosters. When foam applications de-bond, classical methods of failure analysis did not
provide root cause of the failure of the foam. Realizing that foam is the ideal media to
document and preserve its own mode of failure, thin sectioning was seen as a logical
approach for foam failure analysis to observe the three dimensional morphology of the
foam cells. The cell foam morphology provided a much greater understanding of the
failure modes than previously achieved.
