Abstract
In this study, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of three typical fission products Cs, Sr and I on the (111) surfaces of SiC, NbC and ZrC were studied by the first-principles calculations. Cs atom tended to be adsorbed on the H sites of SiC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces, while on the T site of NbC (111) surface. H site of SiC (111) surface and F sites of NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces were the most preferable adsorption sites for Sr. I atom was more likely to be adsorbed on the T site, H site and F site of SiC (111) surface, NbC (111) surface and ZrC (111) surface, respectively. All the above adsorption processes were evidenced to be chemisorption of both ionic and covalent features according to electron structure analysis. The smallest diffusion coefficients of Cs and Sr on these three surfaces at 1373 K were 1.155 × 10−8 m2·s−1 on ZrC (111) surface and 1.544 × 10−8 m2·s−1 on SiC (111) surface, respectively, indicating that ZrC has the best ability to prevent the surface diffusion of Cs, while SiC was the best for preventing Sr. All three carbide ceramic coating materials could effectively resist the surface diffusion of I since the diffusion coefficients of I on them were all relatively low, with the smallest diffusion coefficient of 1.130 × 10−8 m2·s−1 on NbC (111) surface.

1. Introduction
The very high-temperature gas cooled reactors (VHTRs) have been considered as a promising candidate for the Generation IV nuclear reactors since their inherent safety advantage, which is achieved by using tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particles as the nuclear fuel [[1], [2], [3]]. One of the most common TRISO particles consists of a spherical uranium-containing fuel kernel surrounded by four coating layers, namely a buffer pyrolytic carbon layer, an inner dense pyrolytic carbon (IPyC) layer, a silicon carbide (SiC) layer, and an outer dense pyrolytic carbon (OPyC) layer [4]. Among these four coating layers, the SiC layer serves as the primary layer to withstand the pressure and block fission products. However, the conventional SiC coating layer would experience phase transformation, decomposition and mechanical properties degradation over 2000 °C, which may not meet the criteria in the VHTRs with an outlet temperature over 1273 K [[5], [6], [7]]. Therefore, new refractory carbide ceramic coating materials with better high-temperature mechanical properties such as zirconium carbide (ZrC) and niobium carbide (NbC) are developed and considered to replace the SiC layer in TRISO particles in some circumstances [[8], [9], [10]].
Caesium (Cs), Strontium (Sr) and iodine(I) are key fission products in irradiated TRISO particles and have received much attention [11]. Among them, Cs and Sr are typical metallic fission products; Cs and I are representative volatile fission products [12]. Furthermore, Cs is also seen as an indicator for SiC layer failure if it is released from the TRISO particle [13]. Previous studies have shown that pyrolytic carbon layers in TRISO particles could not resist these fission products effectively, thus it is vital to investigate the ability to block fission products of the SiC layer and other potential carbide ceramic coating materials [14]. Results from the American AGR program indicated that Cs and I could be completely retained in the intact SiC layer while Sr would diffuse through it [12,15]. The recommended diffusion coefficients of Cs, Sr and I in the SiC layer could be found in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Tecdoc 978 [14]. Benefiting from its excellent high-temperature mechanical performance, ZrC type TRISO particle has been developed and researched since the 1970 s [16,17]. However, compared to relatively abundant experiment data on the retaining ability of the SiC coating layer to fission products, studies focused on the ZrC coating remain limited. Minato et al. [18,19] found that ZrC layer has a better Cs retention ability than SiC layer by performing post-irradiation heating tests of ZrC-TRISO particles at 1600 °C and 1800 °C. The diffusion behavior of Sr in ZrC was investigated by Fukuda et al. [20] and the diffusion coefficient of 90Sr in ZrC is 1.5 × 10−15 m2/s. NbC is also considered to be used as the coating layer, and NbC-type TRISO particles have been successfully manufactured by Yang et al. [8]. Nevertheless, studies on its performance to block fission products are inadequate to date.
To further analyze how SiC, NbC and ZrC layers retain fission products, it is crucial to study the diffusion mechanism of fission products in them. There would be defects such as stacking faults, microcavities, nano-sized pores and microcracks in the carbide ceramic layer and these defects could facilitate the diffusion of fission products [[21], [22], [23]]. Furthermore, grain boundaries could also serve as channels for fission products to diffuse outward [[24], [25], [26]]. Recent studies have investigated the grain boundary diffusion of key fission products in SiC and reveled the significant role of grain boundary structure in influencing their diffusion behavior [[27], [28], [29]]. During the diffusion process, some fission products such as Cs, Sr and I, are thought to be adsorbed on the surface of the carbide ceramic coating firstly, and preferably diffuse through grain boundaries and defects instead of bulk diffusion in SiC [[30], [31], [32]].
Since it is difficult to directly observe the adsorption and diffusion processes of fission products on carbide ceramic layers at atomic scale experimentally, it is necessary to study them through theoretical methods. First-principles calculation has been successfully employed to investigate the adsorption and diffusion behavior of some fission products, for instance, Cs, Sr, Ag, I and Pd on the surface of β-SiC [[33], [34], [35]]. The current researches mainly focus on the adsorption and diffusion processes of fission products on the surface of SiC, but less on the surfaces of other carbide ceramic coatings. In this study, the adsorption and surface diffusion behaviors of Cs, Sr and I on the surfaces of SiC, NbC and ZrC were investigated by using the first-principles method. The charge distribution and bonding types between the fission products and the adsorption surfaces were determined by the charge transfer, charge density difference and particle density of states. In addition, surface diffusion behaviors including energy barriers and surface diffusion coefficients were analyzed to explore the surface-related transportation of fission products on carbide ceramic coatings. These results aim to provide a new insight into the ability of carbide ceramic coatings to block fission products.
2. Computational details
2.1. Calculation methods
All the first principles calculations in this study were done with the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) based on density functional theory (DFT) [36]. The interaction between valence electrons and ion nuclei was explained by the Projector augmented wave (PAW) method [37]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was used to describe the exchange–correlation potential [38]. After the convergence test, the cutoff energy was set to 550 eV for all the calculations. The first Brillouin zones were sampled using the monkhorst pack method with k-points of 11 × 11 × 11 for the SiC, NbC and ZrC bulk models and 9 × 9 × 1 for the following calculations of their surfaces [39]. The convergence thresholds were set to 0.02 eV/ Å for force and 1.0 × 10−5 eV for energy for all calculations in this study. The diffusion barriers and the minimum energy paths (MEPs) of the fission products on the surface of MC (M=Si, Nb, Zr) were calculated by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [40]. VASPKIT code was used for post-processing [41].
2.2. Calculation models
2.2.1. Bulk models
The SiC coating layer in TRISO particles is mainly 3C-SiC with a space group of F-43 m [42]. The crystal structures of NbC and ZrC are both NaCl-type with a space group of Fm3m [43,44]. Table 1 lists the calculated SiC, NbC and ZrC equilibrium lattice constants, which are 4.380 Å, 4.483 Å and 4.710 Å, respectively. The results are in good agreement with the previous calculated and experimental values, indicating the accuracy of the calculations.

2.2.2. Surface model
The (111) surface slabs of SiC, NbC and ZrC are chosen for the following calculations since the relative intensities of the (111) crystal planes of these three carbide ceramic materials prepared by FB-CVD method are much higher than other crystal planes according to the XRD spectra results [8,9,51]. Several studies have shown that SiC (111) surface is a polar surface, and it could be divided as Si- and C- terminated surfaces, and the former surface has a lower surface energy, indicating that Si- terminated surface has better stability [[52], [53], [54]]. Furthermore, Cheng et al. [44] suggested that SiC (111) surface with even-numbered atomic layers is thermodynamically more favorable, since this type of SiC (111) surface only has one dangling bond. They also showed that 12 atomic layers are thick enough for SiC (111) slab to keep bulk-like interiors. It has been shown that the NbC (111) surface with Nb-termination is more stable than that with C-termination, and the 9-layer Nb-terminated NbC (111) surface would exhibit the bulk-like interior [55,56]. ZrC (111) surface can also be divided as Zr-terminated and C-terminated slabs, and the former surface is more stable [57]. Besides, the ZrC (111) slab with an odd-numbered layer is chosen to avoid the dipole effect, and 9 layers are sufficient to meet the bulk-like characteristics [44]. Therefore, the 3 × 3 surface slabs of SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) were built, and the supercells contain 12 layers, 9 layers and 9 layers, respectively. The final slab models are shown in Fig. 1. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was inserted along the c-axis of the model to reduce the interactions across periodic boundaries to an acceptable level. The bottom two layers were fixed during structural relaxations. All the following calculations of adsorption and diffusion behaviors were performed on the structural optimized slab models. Four highly symmetric sites on the SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces, i.e., Bridge (B) site, Top (T) site, FCC (F) site and HCP (H) site, were selected as the adsorption sites of the fission product atoms, and the initial adsorption height was 4 Å.

The adsorption energies of Cs, Sr and I atoms at the B sites of SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces are not listed in Table 2 because these fission product atoms do not stably adsorb at these sites, moving to adjacent F or H sites. The calculated adsorption energies of Cs, Sr and I atoms on the SiC (111) surface are consistent with the results calculated by Li et al. [33], demonstrating the accuracy of the calculated model and parameters. It can be seen that the adsorption energies of the fission products on these three surfaces are all negative, indicating that the adsorption of the fission products could occur. The Cs atom prefers to be adsorbed on the H site of SiC (111) surface, while the T site of NbC (111) surface and the H site of ZrC (111) surface. The Sr atom tends to be adsorbed on the H site of the SiC (111) surface, while preferring the F site of TiC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces. The I atom is more likely to be adsorbed on the T site, H site and F site of SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surface, respectively. The values in boldface in Table 2 refer to the most stable adsorption energies, and these nine most stable adsorption configurations of Cs, Sr and I atoms on each surface are selected for further investigation.
3.2. Electron structure analysis
To further analyze the bonding type between the fission product atoms and carbide surfaces, the charge density difference (CDD) diagrams were calculated, as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the Bader charges were performed to quantify the electron transfer during the adsorption processes, and the results are summarized in Table 3.

In Fig. 2, the yellow regions indicate an increase in charge density and the blue regions reveal a decrease. For all studied adsorption processes, bonding is apparent between the fission product atoms and the carbide surfaces. Electrons were evidently transferred during the adsorption processes, indicating that chemisorption occurred with chemical bonds formation. In addition, the charge clouds are more likely to aggregate on the side of the more electronegative atoms, exhibiting the characteristics of ionic bonding. For example, there are 0.738 electrons transferred from less electronegative Cs atom to more electronegative Si atoms, which is in agreement with the results of CDD diagram. Previous studies by Li et al. [33]. also reported that the adsorption mechanism of fission product atoms on the SiC (111) surface is chemisorption.
As shown in Fig. 3, the partial density of states (PDOS) diagrams of the fission products and the atoms on the surface and in bulk were calculated to further investigate the interaction between them. In this study, the Fermi level was set at 0 eV by shifting the energy level while performing the DOS analysis. When the Cs atom is adsorbed on the SiC (111) surface, the overlap of the p orbital of Cs atom and the s orbital of surface Si atoms between −10 eV and −8 eV suggests that chemical bonds are formed. From Fig. 3(d) and (g), there are small resonance peaks between Nb/Zr and Cs atoms near −1.1 eV, indicating the formation of weak covalent bonds. Fig. 3(b), (e) and (h) represent the PDOS of Sr atom binding to Si, Nb and Zr atoms, respectively. Similar covalent characteristics can be found between −2 eV to 0.5 eV. Fig. 3(c), (f) and (i) show that when adsorption occurs, the main bonding orbitals of the I atom are the p and d orbitals. The p and d orbitals of I hybridize with Si(p), Nb(p) and Zr(p) orbitals in the range of −6 eV to −2eV, respectively, confirming the existence of the covalent bonding between I atom and carbide surfaces. Therefore, the mechanism of fission product atoms adsorbed on the carbide surfaces is chemical adsorption, and the formed bond is a combination of ionic and covalent bonds.

3.3. Surface diffusion
In addition to the study of adsorption properties, the diffusion behavior of Cs, Sr and I atoms on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces can also reflect the ability of carbide ceramic coatings to retain these fission products. The diffusion of fission products was assumed to occur between the adjacent most stable sites. The minimum energy diffusion paths (MEPs) and energy profiles with corresponding energy barriers were determined by the CI-NEB method, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively.

It can be seen from Fig. 4, the MEPs along the surfaces are not straight lines between the initial and final sites, except for that of I diffusion on the SiC (111) surface and Cs diffusion on the NbC (111) surface. The results of energy profiles in Fig. 5 indicate that the transition states of all nine diffusion processes correspond to the configurations of fission product atoms at the B site. The diffusion process of I on the SiC (111) is similar to the diffusion of Cs on the NbC (111) surface, which both start from the T site, through the transition state B site, and finally reach the neighboring T site. While for other processes, the MEPs could be divided into two parts: the atom diffuses from the most stable site to the second stable site via the B site, and then to the final site after passing through another B site. For instance, Fig. 4(a) shows that on SiC (111) surface, Cs atom moves from the H site to the F site through the B site, and then it goes by another B site before reaching the final H site. Therefore, there are two saddle points on the energy profiles (Fig. 5) for MEPs with two parts.
4. Discussion
To investigate the surface diffusion behaviors of different fission product atoms on carbide ceramic coating layers quantitively, the diffusion coefficients at different temperatures can be calculated by the Arrhenius diffusion equation:

The working temperature of TRISO fuel particles in the VHTR is ranging from 1373 K to 1523 K [62]. In this study, we use 1373 K as a reference working temperature, and the calculated diffusion coefficients of the fission products on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces at this temperature are listed in Table 5.

Table 5 presents that among these three surfaces, Cs exhibits the smallest diffusion coefficient on the ZrC (111) surface, indicating ZrC layer has the best ability to prevent the surface diffusion of Cs. It can be seen that the diffusion coefficient of Sr atom on the SiC (111) surface is smaller than that on NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces at the operating temperature, while the diffusion coefficients of I on these three surfaces at 1373 K vary slightly. The diffusion coefficients of the three fission products on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces are more than four orders of magnitude smaller than those on graphite calculated by McHugh et al. [63], which confirms that the carbide ceramic coating is the main part to prevent the diffusion of fission products in TRISO fuel particles.
The diffusion coefficients of Cs, Sr and I on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces in the temperature range of 1000 K to 2000 K are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the slope of each straight line depends on the values of diffusion barrier

It should be emphasized that this study focuses specifically on the surface diffusion behavior of fission products on various carbide ceramic coatings, rather than attempting to model the whole transport process in the coating layer. Fission products release from the coating layer is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms, including bulk diffusion, grain boundary diffusion, surface diffusion, and defect-assisted migration. The surface diffusion behaviors calculated in this study not intend to directly quantify the overall release kinetics, but provide critical insights into the surface transport capability of fission products, offering a theoretical foundation for evaluating the potential contribution of surface related transport. The results in this study could be integrated with data on bulk and grain boundary diffusion in future studies to comprehensively assess the fission product retention performance of carbide ceramic coatings.
5. Conclusion
The adsorption and diffusion behaviors of three typical fission products Cs, Sr and I atoms on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces were studied using DFT. Cs and Sr atoms prefer to be adsorbed on the H site of SiC (111) surface, while I atom prefers to T site. The configurations of Cs, Sr and I atoms adsorbed on the T site, F site and H site of NbC (111) surface, respectively, are the most stable. As for the ZrC (111) surface, Cs atom tends to be adsorbed on the H site, while both Sr and I atoms tend to the F site. All adsorption processes in this study are chemisorption, and the chemical bonds formed between fission product atoms and carbide surfaces have both ionic and covalent features. Surface diffusion properties were also investigated by the CI-NEB method. At the working temperature of 1373 K for TRISO fuel in the VHTR, it is difficult for Cs atom to diffuse on the ZrC (111) surface and for Sr atom to diffuse on the SiC (111) surface. The surface diffusion coefficients I atom on SiC (111), NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces are all relatively small at 1373 K, where on NbC (111) surface is the lowest. The diffusion coefficients of Cs atom on NbC (111) and ZrC (111) surfaces hardly change with temperature, while the diffusion coefficients of I atom on SiC (111) and NbC (111) surfaces are greatly affected by temperature. The research results could provide theoretical insights into evaluating the surface related transport of fission products, and offer basic parameters for future multi-mechanism coupling analyses aimed at assessing the retention capability of carbide ceramic coatings.
