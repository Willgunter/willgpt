1. Motivation
Castellated structures are widely used in plasma-facing components (PFCs) of fusion devices such as EAST, WEST, ITER, and planned DEMO reactors [1,2]. These segmented designs typically configured as tungsten monoblocks or flat tiles improve thermomechanical strength and tolerance to high heat loads. However, millimeter-scale gaps inevitably exist at block junctions, creating potential pathways for hydrogen isotope (HI) permeation [3]. The retention and permeation of implanted HIs, particularly tritium (T), raise serious safety and operational concerns [4]. ITER imposes a strict safety limit of 1 kg on total in-vessel tritium inventory, with no more than 700 g residing in plasma-facing components [5]. Tritium diffusion through bulk materials may lead to coolant contamination (e.g., forming tritiated water), posing radiological hazards and compromising tritium fuel cycle sustainability. In castellated structures, gaps provide a critical shortcut for enhanced permeation, allowing HIs to bypass the thick tungsten armor and penetrate directly into the copper heat sink. This risk is amplified by the fact that measured permeation fluxes through copper are orders of magnitude higher than through tungsten under comparable conditions [6]. Consequently, HI transport through PFC gaps may account for a significant fraction of the total tritium leakage in reactors.
While numerous studies have estimated total fuel retention in monoblock divertors by modeling HI permeation from the implantation zone to the coolant tube [[7], [8], [9]], they commonly neglect transport within the gaps. In contrast, the 3D modeling work by Delaporte-Mathurin et al. [10] stands out by quantifying the influence of poloidal gaps on surface desorption, thereby establishing their crucial contribution to overall retention. To model hydrogen isotope behavior in solids, a range of simulation tools—such as TMAP7, MHIMS [9], and TESSIM-X [11,12] for 1D simulations, and TMAP8 or FESTIM [10,13] for 2D/3D simulations are commonly employed. These codes incorporate multiple physical phenomena including implantation, recombination, dissociation, diffusion, and trapping. Yet, the detailed transport mechanisms inside castellated gaps remain insufficiently addressed.
Meanwhile, experimental studies have shed light on the complex physics of plasma-driven permeation (PDP). In linear plasma devices, substrate biasing is often applied to accelerate plasma particles, thereby replicating the broad energy spectra characteristic of fusion boundary plasmas. Key factors governing PDP include material properties, temperature, particle flux, and incident particle energy [[14], [15], [16]]. Specifically, the dependence of hydrogen isotope permeation on incident energy, which ranges up to several hundred eV in tokamak divertor conditions, displays a distinct non-monotonic behavior. This complexity arises from the competition of multiple physical processes, the dominance of which shifts with energy [17,18]. At lower incident energies, shallow implantation leads to high particle concentration near the surface [19], which can enhance inward diffusion and permeation due to strong concentration gradients and low diffusion barriers from subsurface to bulk regions [20]. As energy increases, particles penetrate deeper and may be trapped at intrinsic or radiation-induced defects [[21], [22], [23]]. This can increase retention but does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in permeation, as it depends on the material's damage threshold and defect microstructure [24]. At even higher energies, surface sputtering effects are significantly enhanced. Sputtering not only enhances surface cleanliness but also directly promotes deuterium release through the physical ejection of adsorbed atoms, thereby suppressing net permeation [25,26]. It is important to emphasize that the energy thresholds for these transitions are not universal but are strongly influenced by the target material's composition, crystallographic orientation, and surface morphology [[27], [28], [29]].
This theoretically predicted suppression of permeation at elevated energies finds direct support in experimental observations under biasing. Notably, applied bias does not produce the expected increase in permeation flux across different experimental configurations. For instance, Liu et al. reported a decrease in permeation with increasing negative bias in bare membranes, which they attributed to surface impurity removal (e.g., oxides and carbides) by high-energy particle bombardment, consistent with the sputter-induced suppression mechanism described above [16]. In a more geometrically complex system relevant to PFCs, Wang et al., used an 8 mm thick tungsten tile with gaps to simulate PFC internal structure, and found no significant permeation increase under bias compared to the unbiased case [30]. Unlike bare membranes, the transport of plasma and neutral particles within narrow gaps cannot be directly measured, making it difficult to correlate entrance conditions with permeation behavior at the gap bottom. How the specific particle flux and energy distribution at the bottom influence permeation remains poorly understood. Moreover, conventional diagnostic techniques are unable to obtain direct internal data due to the millimeter-scale gap width.
To address these challenges, this study offers possible explanations for the experimental observations on plasma-driven permeation by combining experimental results with insights from Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. By self-consistently accounting for the effects of sheath electric and magnetic fields on particle trajectories and impact positions, we reconstruct the transport pathways of hydrogen isotopes along the gap depth and quantify the spatial distribution of particle and energy fluxes at the bottom. This allows us to reveal the key physical mechanisms by which bias influences permeation behavior in the gaps.
2. Experimental investigation of hydrogen isotope permeation under applied bias
2.1. PREFACE facility and experimental setup
The plasma-driven permeation experiments were conducted on the PREFACE facility [3,31] (Permeation and Retention Evaluation Facility for Fusion Experiments) at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, the facility comprises an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source (6 kW, 2.45 GHz) for deuterium plasma generation, with the plasma confined by a magnetic field from four water-cooled coils. The facility is equipped with comprehensive diagnostics: (i) a Langmuir probe for measuring edge plasma parameters (electron temperature Te = 2–6 eV, density ne = 1016–1017 m−3), (ii) an Avantes spectrometer (197–717 nm range) for capturing plasma emission/absorption spectra, and (iii) multiple K-type thermocouples for temperature monitoring.

The sample stage is designed for versatile permeation studies. A tungsten wire heater, regulated by current control, allows for sample temperature regulation between 300 and 750 K, which is monitored by an attached thermocouple. Furthermore, the stage is connected to a power supply, enabling the application of a negative bias voltage (0 to 200 V) to adjust the incident ion energy.
2.2. Tungsten monoblock mock-up and permeation measurement
The core experimental component under investigation is a tungsten monoblock mock-up, depicted in detail in Fig. 1b. This mock-up is designed to replicate the critical geometry of a tokamak divertor plasma-facing unit. It is composed of two distinct parts: (1) The upper tungsten armor: This part, termed the “tungsten sample” in this study, has dimensions of 22 mm × 22 mm × 8 mm and features a precision-engineered gap of 0.4 mm in width, as shown in Fig. 1c. (2) The lower CuCrZr heat sink: The tungsten sample is joined to this block via tight mechanical contact (pressing), creating an interface crucial for the permeation pathway.
A key design feature is the 5° angling of the tungsten gap relative to the surface normal. This geometry replicates the actual configuration in a tokamak divertor, where the toroidal gaps between monoblocks are oriented at an angle to the incoming magnetic field lines. This angled configuration prevents direct line-of-sight for incident particles into the gap, ensuring that the measured permeation more accurately represents the flow expected in a real reactor environment, rather than simple direct implantation at the gap bottom.
The deuterium permeation experiments were specifically conducted to measure the flux propagating through this angled gap and the subsequent interfaces. The permeation flux was quantified in real-time using quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS), calibrated against VTI standard leaks to ensure accuracy. The QMS detected the gas that had permeated through the entire monoblock assembly, exiting from the downstream side of the CuCrZr heat sink.
2.3. Preliminary permeation result and necessity for modeling
As summarized in Fig. 2, the initial permeation results revealed a counter-intuitive phenomenon: applying a negative bias voltage did not enhance the permeation flux measured at the bottom of the CuCrZr heat sink. The measured flux remained comparable to, or was slightly lower than, that under unbiased conditions. Since the complex transport processes of plasma and neutrals within the sub-millimeter gaps are not directly accessible to experimental diagnostics, this observation could not be resolved by measurement alone. Therefore, to elucidate the underlying physics governing the particle dynamics within the gaps, we employed numerical simulations. The details and results of this modeling are presented and discussed in the following sections.

3. Model setup
PICS2 [32,33] is a two-dimensional particle-in-cell code developed to simulate sheath plasma dynamics near divertor tiles, explicitly resolving the gaps between them. Its methodology is conceptually similar to established codes such as SPICE2 [34,35] and EPPIC2D [36,37]. The code self-consistently tracks the trajectories of a large population of ions and electrons by solving their equations of motion coupled with the Poisson equation, subject to specified boundary conditions. Particle dynamics are governed by the self-consistent electric field and a static background magnetic field.
Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the left and right boundaries (x-direction) of the simulation domain. At the sheath entrance (z-direction), boundary conditions are defined by edge plasma parameters measured with a Langmuir probe: electron density ne = 1.5 × 1016 m−3, electron temperature Te = 2 eV, and ion temperature Ti = 0.026 eV. A magnetic field of 300 G is applied at an angle of 85° relative to the tungsten (W) surface. The divertor structure is modeled using 8 mm thick W tiles separated by 0.4 mm gaps, mounted on structural materials to replicate a monoblock-type PFC. The wall boundary incorporates a floating potential condition alongside an applied bias voltage of Vwall = −100 V.
The simulation geometry is shown in Fig. 3. The top surface of the tungsten wall defines the reference plane at z = 0. Particles are injected into the domain from the sheath entrance region (z > 0), propagating in the negative z-direction towards the wall. The computational domain is discretized into a structured grid of cells. To mitigate numerical instabilities, especially near boundaries, the cell size (Δx, Δz) must be smaller than key plasma scales, particularly the Debye length (λD). The calculated Debye length is 85.8 µm, following the formula 
, where Te is the electron temperature (in K) and n is the electron number density (in m−3). The other constants are the vacuum permittivity (Ɛ0), the Boltzmann constant (k), and the elementary charge (e). Careful selection of three interdependent numerical parameters is critical: the time step (Δt), the cell size, and the overall domain length in z. Inappropriate choices for any of these parameters can lead to unphysical results or failure to convergence. Crucially, an excessive time step Δt generates significant numerical artifacts and violate energy conservation. Consequently, in this study, we employ a time step of Δt = 5 × 10−12 s for advancing the particle positions and solving for the self-consistent electric field. The cell size is set to Δx = Δz = 20 µm, which is significantly smaller than λD (85.8 µm) to ensure stability. Furthermore, the domain extent in the z-direction must be sufficient to encompass the entire magnetic presheath region. To meet these requirements, the simulation utilizes a grid comprising 40 cells in the x-direction (parallel to the wall) and 680 cells in the z-direction (normal to the wall).

4. Simulation results and discussion
4.1. Biasing effect on the sheath
Fig. 4 depicts the electric potential distribution under two distinct conditions: (a) floating potential and (b) biased wall potential (Vwall = −100 V). In the floating case, a relatively thin sheath (∼0.5 mm) exhibits smooth potential gradients influenced primarily by self-consistent plasma fields. The potential difference across the gap is modest, with wall potentials stabilizing near −8 V. Applying a negative bias induces significant structural reorganization: stronger electron repulsion and ion attraction produce a pronounced negative sheath with substantially increased thickness (∼1.5 mm). This expansion aligns with theoretical predictions [15], where sheath thickness evolves from 
 (floating) to 
 under bias. Although the sheath thickens, the enhanced potential drop (Δφ) from plasma to wall dominates, yielding a strengthened average electric field E ≈ Δφ/d. Field intensification becomes extreme near the gap entrance and corners, where geometric focusing creates local maxima in electric field strength. These regions exhibit the most intense plasma-surface interactions, including strong ion bombardment, which is consistent with theoretical and empirical sheath modulation under external biasing.

To facilitate direct data comparison, one-dimensional potential profiles along the Z-axis are provided in panels (c) and (d), corresponding to the gap center (x = 0.2 mm) and the block edge (x = –0.4 mm), respectively. Under applied negative bias, the potential near the PFCs is significantly lower (i.e., more negative) than that in the floating sheath case. The profiles gradually converge toward each other near the sheath entrance. A comparison between the two positions (x = 0.2 mm and x = –0.4 mm) reveals only minor differences, mainly localized near the gap entrance.
Fig. 5 displays the ion density distribution near the gap region under floating and −100 V biased conditions. The right-hand panels show magnified views of the confined regions marked by orange lines in the left-hand panels. Simulations show a substantial reduction in ion density at the gap entrance. Specifically, the peak ion deposition density under biasing (3.5 × 1015 m−3) is significantly lower than the 1.2 × 101⁶ m−3 observed under floating sheath conditions. According to the Child-Langmuir law [38,39], for a fixed sheath voltage drop of −100 V, an increase in sheath thickness corresponds to a reduction in both ion density and ion flux density at the sheath edge. The ion saturation current density, calculated under the zero-magnetic-field approximation 
, is approximately 20.3 A/m2. In contrast, the Child-Langmuir law predicts a reduced ion current density of ∼14.9 A/m2 under biasing, following the formula 
 [39]. This represents a 26 % decrease relative to the unbiased case. This discrepancy highlights the role of space charge effects in modulating ion transport under biased conditions.

4.2. Ion velocity and direction
Fig. 6(a) and (b) characterizes ion dynamics near plasma-facing gaps through velocity vectors (arrow direction) and magnitude mapping (color scale). Under both floating and biased (−100 V) conditions, sheath-induced electric fields deflect ion trajectories at gap entrances. For direct data comparison, panel (c) includes a velocity profile at x = 0 mm, showing the variation of the velocity with z under both conditions. Under negative bias, the velocity component is significantly greater than under floating conditions. Moreover, a fundamental divergence emerges in transport mechanisms. Under floating potentials, ions penetrate deeply into gaps and impact sidewalls at near-normal incidence angles. When a negative bias is applied, a significant proportion of ions reach the gap bottoms with high impact velocities, reaching approximately 100 km/s when energy loss is neglected. This is facilitated by the Larmor radii of some ions, the calculated typical value 
 allows direct entry into the gaps, as confirmed by distribution analyses [40].

Particles that permeate into the tungsten and structural materials at the gap bottom originate from two main sources: atoms from the background plasma that enter directly, and ions that collide with the wall and are reflected as neutral particles. The latter constitute the dominant source of permeation. Reflected particles follow a cosine angular distribution [41,42] and undergo multiple reflections between the sidewalls, which redirect most of them toward the gap bottom. However, when ions strike the bottom directly, a fraction of the reflected atoms may escape along the entry path. As a result, even though a negative bias increases ion energy, the overall particle retention in the bottom materials does not rise. This simulation provides a mechanistic explanation for the experimental observation that permeation flux remains unchanged under biasing.
Two key factors contribute to this constant permeation flux under biasing. First, the increased incident energy enhances surface sputtering, which removes impurities and reduces permeation into the underlying material through this cleaning effect. Second, the modified sheath structure alters ion trajectories, increasing reflection and thereby reducing the number of particles deposited or retained at the bottom. Near the gap entrance, ion paths deviate significantly from the initial magnetic field lines (oriented 5° from the surface normal).
Under floating conditions, the funnel-shaped equipotential surfaces (Fig. 4) produce strong lateral electric fields toward the sidewalls, steering low-energy ions into repeated sidewall collisions. Although collisional redirection eventually guides some particles to the gap bottom, they arrive with substantially reduced energy, which still allows notable permeation to occur. In contrast, under negative bias, a large number of high-energy ions reach the bottom directly. Their bombardment sputters surface impurities, enhancing deuterium recombination on the front surface and thereby reducing net permeation flux [16]. In addition, reflection causes some atoms to escape the gaps entirely. In summary, the sheath configuration, whether floating or biased, plays a critical role in determining ion direction and energy inside gaps, which in turn affects the neutral atom deposition density at the bottom and the overall plasma permeability.
4.3. Particles distribution near and inside plasma facing gaps
As illustrated in Fig. 7, particle deposition concentrates near gap entrances under both floating and biased conditions. Under −100 V bias, ion flux decreases substantially relative to the floating case, while electrons are effectively excluded due to electrostatic repulsion. Consequently, total particle flux impacting sidewalls under floating conditions exceeds the biased case by over an order of magnitude, consistent with the sheath-thickness-modulated near-wall particle densities established in Section 4.1 (Fig. 4).

Fig. 8 further reveals a critical contrast: negative biasing enhances ion deposition at gap bottoms by more than an order of magnitude compared to floating conditions. This difference arises from distinct electric-field-driven trajectory modifications, as shown in Fig. 6. Under −100 V bias, strong vertical electric fields near the walls enable two key effects. Elevated ion energies increase penetration probability through sheath potential barriers, and near-normal incidence angles facilitate direct access to the gap bottom. In contrast, floating conditions generate funnel-shaped equipotential surfaces (Fig. 4) that produce lateral field components toward sidewalls, deflecting low-energy ions and forcing collisional redirection through multiple sidewall reflections before bottom arrival.

Thus, despite amplified ion energy and delivery to gap depths under bias, permeation remains suppressed due to reduced sidewall interactions limiting particle redirection, and energy-dependent reflection dynamics at material interfaces. Collectively, these mechanisms explain the experimentally observed permeation invariance despite enhanced ion delivery to gap bottoms under negative biasing.
By synthesizing findings from sheath structure, ion trajectories, and flux distributions, a coherent picture emerges that resolves the biasing experimental result. Applying of a negative bias establishes a strong vertical electric field that directs high-energy ions to the gap bottom. However, this occurs at the expense of sidewall interactions, which are significant under floating conditions. Crucially, the high impact energy of bias-accelerated ions, as inferred from their velocities, promotes reflection rather than retention. Thus, the simulations demonstrate that the transition from a “multi-reflection, low-energy deposition” mode (floating) to a “direct-acceleration, high-energy reflection” mode (biased) is the fundamental reason for decreased permeation despite enhanced ion delivery to the gap bottom.
5. Conclusion
Based on plasma-driven permeation biasing experiments conducted on the PREFACE facility, this study investigates the influence of biasing on the influx of hydrogen isotopes and their subsequent transport within the gaps of ITER-like tungsten monoblocks. To achieve this, we employed the 2D3V particle-in-cell code PICS2 to simulate the self-consistent electric fields and trace the transport of ions and electrons in and around the gaps. These simulations, which characterized conditions of an applied −100 V bias and a floating sheath potential, allowed us to quantify particle and energy fluxes inside the gaps and provide a mechanistic interpretation of the permeation behavior measured at the bottom surface. The main findings are as follows:
1.
Sheath modification under biasing: The application of a negative bias increases the sheath thickness. Under the assumption of negligible particle loss, the particle flux density at the gap entrance under biased conditions is lower than that under floating sheath conditions.
2.
Particle deposition patterns: Under floating potential, ions initially strike the sidewalls and reach the gap bottom after multiple reflections. In contrast, under negative bias, ions are directly accelerated toward the gap bottom with elevated energy, while electron flux is nearly suppressed.
3.
Permeation modulation mechanisms: Under the −100 V bias condition, ions are accelerated to higher energies upon entering the gap. This elevated energy significantly enhances the probability of particle sputtering and reflection upon collision with the gap bottom. Consequently, a large fraction of incident particles is reflected and ultimately escape from the gap, rather than being deposited. This reflection-dominated process substantially reduces the effective particle inventory available for permeation. In contrast, under floating conditions, ions undergo multiple reflections with energy loss at each interaction, which promotes eventual deposition at the bottom surface and facilitates permeation. Therefore, the key reason why applied bias does not significantly enhance total permeation is the transition to a reflection-dominated regime that reduces net particle retention, rather than an increase in successful deposition.
This work clarifies how the electric field configuration governs ion transport and energy distribution inside PFC gaps, identifying a transition from a multi-reflection, deposition-dominated regime under floating conditions to a direct-acceleration, reflection-dominated regime under biasing as the key mechanism influencing permeation behavior. Importantly, we demonstrate that permeation is governed not merely by total incident energy or flux, but by the specific energy spectrum, ion trajectories, final deposition location, and retention efficiency—all of which are controlled by sheath electric field geometry. These results highlight the electric field structure as a dominant factor influencing hydrogen isotope retention in castellated PFCs.
It should be noted that this study focuses primarily on the plasma physics governing ion influx and intra-gap transport, essentially addressing the source term for permeation. A comprehensive quantitative comparison with experimental permeation measurements requires further modeling efforts in two key directions: first, the integration of Monte Carlo simulations to accurately describe particle–wall collisions, reflection, and neutral atom distributions; and second, the coupling of plasma-source terms from PIC simulations with dedicated hydrogen transport codes (such as FESTIM or TMAP) to model subsequent diffusion, trapping, and recombination processes within bulk materials. While this is a logical and critical next step, it remains a subject for future work.
By offering this mechanistic insight, our study provides a critical theoretical basis for understanding hydrogen isotope transport through PFC gaps, with direct relevance to hydrogen isotope inventory control and fuel cycle sustainability in fusion devices. Future work will pursue an integrated simulation approach that combines plasma dynamics, particle–wall interactions, and bulk transport modeling to enable quantitatively predictive capabilities to support optimized PFC design and tritium management strategies.
