1. Introduction
Icing, as a prevalent natural phenomenon, is particularly prominent in cold regions and poses considerable challenges to ocean engineering (Dong et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Overeem et al., 2022). With global climate change and expanding human activities, interactions between ice and coastal engineering structures, vessels, and offshore platforms have become increasingly frequent, leading to heightened concerns about ice-induced disasters (Burrell et al., 2023; Pang, 2022; Prowse et al., 2011). Particularly noteworthy is the brittle fracture of ice bodies resulting from the accumulation of internal stresses to their ultimate limits, which is renowned not only for its unpredictable suddenness but also for the extensive and severe environmental and infrastructural damage it causes in comparison with other forms of ice failure (Zhang et al., 2022b). In this context, the thorough elucidation of the mechanisms underlying brittle failure in ice has become crucial for disaster prevention and mitigation.
Uniaxial compression testing serves as a fundamental experimental means of studying such failure and has considerable scientific research value (Deng et al., 2020; Jordaan, 2001; Liu, 2022; Xu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2022c). To date, substantial progress has been made in the field of brittle failure of ice under uniaxial compression by numerous researchers, yet notable limitations persist across various research methodologies. The study of ice brittleness failure conducted by Renshaw et al. (2014), Iliescu and Schulson (2002), and Schulson (2001) through experimental means provides intuitive visualization of the ice failure process but faces challenges in comprehensively capturing and quantitatively characterizing the complex fracture morphologies and fragment distribution features arising during the failure of ice materials. Although Motahari et al. (2025), Sun et al. (2023), Kolari and Kouhia (2022), and Gribanov et al. (2018) overcome the limitations of experimental observations through numerical simulation methods, two key deficiencies remain: an inadequate detailed description of crack propagation paths and insufficient consideration of the influence mechanism of temperature gradients on ice fracture modes. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces fractal dimension and particle flow simulation methods.
The fractal dimension, as a quantitative indicator for describing complex morphologies and structures, precisely captures the complexity and irregularity of brittle cracks in ice, offering a new perspective to uncover the underlying mechanisms of crack propagation (Fernández-Martínez and Sánchez-Granero, 2014). In 1967, the concept of fractals was first introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot to quantitatively describe the coastline of the United Kingdom (Bayrak and Kirci, 2022). This originated from the theory of coastline research, and its application has been rapidly expanding to cover many fields, such as ocean transport analysis (El-Nabulsi and Anukool, 2024), Ocean data research (Shu et al., 2023) and seafloor morphology characterization (Herzfeld et al., 1995). As the theory of fractals has evolved, the self-similarity of various phenomena has emerged as an effective approach for addressing complex and random problems (Karaca et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Wen and Cheong, 2021). This approach has been extensively applied in the crack analysis of materials such as rock and concrete, leading to important achievements (Wei et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). Perfect (1997) characterized fragments as a natural phenomenon that can be represented by fractals. A series of studies has been conducted to investigate the fractal characteristics of rock fragments via fractal theory(Bagde et al., 2002; Lai et al., 2023; Tingting, 2009). Yuanyo (2014) conducted rockburst tests on large-diameter samples under various loading and unloading conditions and studied the weight distribution and fractal characteristics of rock fragments after rockburst, as well as the relationship between rockburst intensity and fractal characteristics. Huang et al. (2012) conducted unloading tests on marble under high triaxial stress conditions and investigated the fragmentation distribution patterns of rocks under high-stress unloading via fractal theory and energy principles. Although fractal theory is well-established in rock mechanics, its application in ice mechanics remains exploratory. Existing studies have demonstrated fractal characteristics in ice surface roughness (Wadhams and Davis, 1970), fracture networks (Weiss, 2001), and fragment distributions (Xu et al., 2004). While these works established correlations between fractal dimensions and macroscopic mechanical behavior of ice, several critical knowledge gaps remain. First, most fractal studies have focused on large-scale ice sheets or floating ice systems (Bishop and Chellis, 1989; El-Nabulsi, 2025), leaving the temperature effects on ice under uniaxial compression poorly understood. Second, although fractal dimensions have been used to correlate microscopic damage with macroscopic responses (Weiss, 2001), the temperature-dependent fractal evolution patterns have not been systematically revealed. Fractal studies on the brittle failure of ice under uniaxial compression at different temperatures not only refine the theoretical framework of fractal theory related to ice failure but also enable a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties of ice by revealing temperature-sensitive fractal evolution patterns. This progress, in turn, facilitates the prediction of ice failure modes and the assessment of ice structural stability.
The propagation trajectories and failure modes of brittle cracks in ice exhibit significant variations across different temperatures, which holds great importance for understanding the mechanical behavior of ice and predicting the occurrence of ice-related hazards. Although high-speed cameras can visually display the process of material damage, simulation analysis can provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms involved. Each of the various numerical simulation methods has its advantages and limitations. Although the extended finite element method (XFEM) can accurately track known crack paths, it necessitates the pre-definition of crack region prior to simulation (Wang et al., 2016). Although the phase-field model can capture crack topological evolution through diffuse interfaces, it lacks direct physical correspondence for its core parameters (e.g., the phase-field scale parameter and interface energy coefficient), leading to reduced interpretability of the results (You et al., 2020). Compared with the aforementioned numerical methods, Particle Flow Code (PFC) has unique advantages in that it employs discrete particle assembly and contact mechanics to simulate the processes of microcrack nucleation, propagation, and coalescence at ice crystal interfaces dynamically without the need to set crack paths or initial defects (Castro-Filgueira et al., 2020; Mehranpour and Kulatilake, 2017). Moreover, its key parameters possess clear physical meanings, facilitating direct correlation with actual physical processes. Additionally, the parallel bond model in PFC can directly reflect changes in the rigidity of the hydrogen bond network through temperature-dependent microscopic parameters, such as bond strength and friction angle (Zhang and Wong, 2012). This characteristic is highly important for revealing the temperature sensitivity of brittle fracture in ice at low temperatures. PFC has been extensively utilized in fields such as geotechnical engineering and geomechanics to simulate the complex mechanical behaviors of granular materials, encompassing the initiation, propagation, and failure processes of cracks (Meng et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2024). Despite important research achievements attributed to PFC in various fields, its application in studying the mechanical properties of ice remains relatively limited. This circumstance does not imply that the method is infeasible or ineffective for ice research. In fact, some scholars have attempted to use PFC to study the mechanical behavior of ice and have achieved positive results. For example, Deng et al. (2023) employed PFC to analyze the geometric characteristics of river ice microstructures, providing a new perspective for understanding the physical structure of ice. Sun et al. (2023) studied the multiscale fracture behavior and failure modes of polycrystalline ice under tensile and compressive loads via PFC numerical simulation software, further expanding the application scope of PFC in the field of ice mechanics. However, despite these initial attempts, scholars have not yet conducted detailed research and analysis on brittle failure scenarios in ice under different temperature conditions. This study aims to demonstrate through systematic PFC numerical simulations that the PFC is not only applicable to crack research in ice but also capable of providing reliable and accurate simulation results, thereby providing strong support for addressing new challenges in the field of ice mechanics.
This study conducts an in-depth investigation into the uniaxial compressive characteristics of brittle failure in ice at various temperatures, employing fractal analysis and the Particle Flow Code 2D (PFC2D) method. During the process of uniaxial compression, the dynamic process of ice failure is captured, followed by the extraction of image information of ice cracks via image processing techniques for the analysis of crack propagation. Fractal fragmentation theory is utilized for an in-depth analysis of fragments from brittle materials subjected to uniaxial compression tests, elucidating key factors, including the fragment size distribution, mass allocation ratio, and impact of varying temperature conditions on the fractal dimension. Simultaneously, simulations of uniaxial brittle failure scenarios in ice are conducted via the PFC2D software platform, with a detailed examination of brittle crack propagation trajectories and failure modes under different temperature conditions. These research findings not only enhance our understanding of the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of ice but also provide vital theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for the protection of hydraulic structures. Furthermore, this study fully demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of fractal dimension and PFC2D in ice mechanics research, paving new paths for future related studies.
2. Raw materials and methodology
2.1. Sample preparation and handling
Schwarz et al. (1981) proposed a specific recommendation for the aspect ratio of ice samples in uniaxial compression tests, suggesting that the sample length should be approximately 2.5 times its diameter. In accordance with these guidelines, actual cylindrical ice samples with a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 125 mm were prepared. Fig. 1 depicts the comprehensive procedure for preparing a cylindrical ice sample. First, the water was stored in a low-temperature laboratory for 3 h before sample preparation to ensure temperature stability. A circular acrylic tube mold was subsequently positioned in a plastic base, and a small quantity of water was injected into it. The mold was then placed in a low-temperature chamber, and various temperature gradients (−12 °C, −16 °C, −20 °C, −24 °C, and −28 °C) were established, which lasted 12 h to guarantee complete solidification of the ice base. Next, additional water was injected into the mold, and a small HJ-111 submersible pump (size 40 × 38 × 30 mm, power 2 W) was installed on the top of the mold to eliminate bubbles at the ice‒water interface by disturbing the water body, thereby promoting the formation of a transparent ice sample (Shazly et al., 2009). After 24 h of complete freezing, the ice was demolded at a room temperature of 25 °C. Then, a vertical ice saw was used in a low-temperature chamber, the two ends of the cylindrical ice sample (the ice base part and the part containing the submersible pump) were cut into cylindrical samples with a size of Φ 50 mm × 125 mm, and the irregular ends of the cylindrical ice sample were polished. The ice samples prepared in this study have a density of 920 kg/m3, and the ice crystals within the prepared samples are polycrystalline ice.

2.2. Experimental setup and testing procedure
The mechanical properties of ice subjected to uniaxial compression at different temperatures were investigated with an RWS100 low-temperature uniaxial compression testing machine as the loading equipment, as shown in Fig. 2. Prior to experimentation, the ice samples were polished and ground with grid sandpaper to ensure that the flatness of the end face was less than 0.02 mm, eliminating the knife marks generated by the band saw. The ice samples were then stored at the test temperature for 24 h to achieve thermal balance, and the quality of each ice sample was measured. The testing machine uses a hydraulic loading system, which can realize stepless speed regulation in the range of 0.000001–100 mm/min, and the temperature range is −70 °C to +50 °C. According to the ductile and brittle characteristics of ice under compression conditions, the experimental strain rate was selected as 1.33 × 10−2 s−1. The experimental temperatures for the ice samples were −12 °C, −16 °C, −20 °C, −24 °C, and −28 °C. During the freezing process, microcracks and pores with random distributions form within ice, and these microscopic defects directly impact its compressive strength. To ensure the reliability of the experimental results and reduce the error caused by this randomness, we performed six repetitions of the experiment with reference to the research method of Deng et al. (2020). Additionally, high-definition digital cameras (PowerShot SX740) and high-speed cameras (Revealer AE110) were used to capture the surface failure processes of the samples. The high-speed camera had a sampling frequency of 500 Hz, an image resolution of 1280 × 860 pixels, and an image element size of 7 μm × 7 μm.

2.3. Fractal characteristics of brittle crack propagation
Owing to its similarity to rocks, ice contains a considerable number of randomly distributed microdamage structures, such as pores, cracks, and weak media, whose distribution patterns and geometric shapes exhibit statistical self-similarity within a certain measurement range (Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, this microscopic damage rapidly develops and interconnects under external loads. Therefore, if the ice fragments have fractal sizes, their size distribution can be used to estimate the fractal dimension. To analyze the fractal characteristics of the ice fragments, this study screened the fragments after uniaxial compression. The screening process was conducted in a low-temperature laboratory environment maintained at −20 °C, and all operations were manually performed by trained professionals. Throughout the screening, the staff exercised extreme caution, handling the ice fragments gently and in accordance with standardized procedures to minimize any potential damage. Additionally, we strictly controlled the duration of each screening session, limiting it to no more than 60 s. Fragments passing through a sieve with an aperture of d were considered to have a size smaller than d. Fractal theory assumes that the total mass of the sample is Mt. The mass of the sample with fragments smaller than or equal to d is denoted as M1(d), and the mass of the sample with fragments larger than d is M2(d). Hence, the following equation can be established:
(1)
According to the assumption of Wheatcraft and Tyler (1988), the fractal relationship between the mass and particle size of crushed ice can be expressed as follows:
(2)
where D is the fractal dimension of the mixed size of ice fragments.
Taking the logarithm of both sides of the above equation, it is concluded that:
(3)
The experiment utilized standard sieves to classify the fragments into five particle size ranges: 0–1 mm, 1–2 mm, 2–5 mm, 5–10 mm, 10–20 mm, and >20 mm, as depicted in Fig. 3. On the basis of the fragmentation results, the fragmentation state and particle size distribution characteristics of the ice samples at different temperatures were analyzed. The mass of the fragments under each aperture was measured via an electronic scale. Subsequently, 
 and 
 were used as the y-axis and x-axis, respectively, to create a scatter plot. The slope (k) of the fitted line was obtained through linear fitting of the data via the least squares method, thus enabling the calculation of D = 3 – k.

2.4. PFC simulation of brittle crack propagation
Although high-speed camera technology has been employed in experiments to visually capture brittle failure modes, the utilization of PFC2D for simulation analysis retains its unique value and necessity. Despite being confined to two-dimensional space, PFC2D has considerable potential in the fields of rock mechanics and engineering because of its powerful simulation capabilities (Meng et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2025). The PFC2D simulation technique offers profound insights into microscopic details, including interparticle interaction mechanisms, force transmission pathways, and stress concentrations, which are crucial for comprehending macroscopic failure modes. By leveraging this simulation approach, researchers can observe subtle phenomena that are difficult to capture directly in experiments, such as the initiation and propagation processes of microcracks, and can unequivocally differentiate between tensile and shear cracks. This section delves into the numerical modeling and micromechanical characteristics of brittle ice failure phenomena, utilizing PFC2D to simulate the evolution of cracks within ice bodies.
First, a complete numerical sample is generated via PFC2D, and its size is highly consistent with that of the experimental sample, both of which are 50 mm by 125 mm. To simulate the properties of ice, the parallel bond model (PBM) within PFC2D was employed to construct the numerical sample. This model has been extensively validated as effective and reliable in simulating the mechanical behavior of brittle materials (Li et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024). Yang et al. (2006) reported that when the ratio of the sample size to the average particle radius (L/R) exceeds 80, the macroscopic mechanical behavior of the particle system tends to stabilize, and the influence of the particle size is significantly diminished. Therefore, the particle size follows a uniform distribution ranging from 0.360 mm to 0.200 mm (Huang, 1999; Yang et al., 2006); that is, the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum particle size is set to 1.8 to ensure the accuracy of the model. The density of ice was set to 920 kg/m3, which was obtained for the experiment. The number of particles in the ice model is 22729, which are randomly distributed in space to achieve a natural and irregular arrangement. During the simulation, the lower platen of the ice model remained fixed, whereas the upper loading platen moved downward at a constant speed of 1.667 × 10−2 m/s to simulate the uniaxial compression process, as shown in Fig. 4.

The simulation parameters were established as follows. First, the particle stiffness ratio, friction coefficient, and parallel bonding internal friction angle were established as fixed parameters based on physical principles and literature constraints. The microparameters utilized in the ice sample model within PFC2D for this study are as follows:
The ratio of normal stiffness to shear stiffness for both particles and parallel bonds is set to 1 (Qiu and Peng, 2021). For brittle ice failure, such as crack propagation, strength has a more significant impact than the stiffness ratio (Li et al., 2022). Setting the particle stiffness ratio to 1 can effectively reduce the degrees of freedom of the model, minimize unnecessary parameter coupling, and simplify subsequent calibration. The determination of the friction coefficient is considered in light of its correlation with the relative slip velocity between particles. However, since the relative slip velocity of particles is difficult to estimate directly from the loading velocity in practical simulations, an accurate value of the friction coefficient cannot be obtained during numerical simulations. On the basis of the findings of Frederking and Barker (2001), the range of the internal friction coefficient for ice-ice contact interfaces is approximately 0.05–0.2. Consequently, the friction coefficient is set to the midpoint value of 0.1 within this range for the numerical experiments in this study. According to the research findings of Shan et al. (2017), the measured internal friction angle of ice was determined to be 16.4° at an ambient temperature of −20 °C, whereas this value decreased to 9.2° at −10 °C. A study conducted by Xu et al. (2011) also demonstrated that the internal friction angle of ice tends to increase with decreasing ambient temperature. On the basis of this pattern, the range of internal friction angles was reasonably established to be between 10° and 22° within the temperature range of −12 °C to −28 °C set for this study.
After fixing these parameters, remaining critical microscopic parameters (particle contact modulus and parallel-bond tensile strength) were calibrated via trial-and-error(De Silva et al., 2018; Su et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022a) to match macroscopic mechanical responses (primarily effective elastic modulus and uniaxial compressive strength) with experimental targets. Given that the particle contact modulus mainly governs the initial slope of the stress-strain curve, while the parallel-bond tensile strength mainly controls the peak compressive strength, and given that the correlation between these two parameters is weak, the calibration process can employ a staged optimization approach where one parameter is fixed while the other is adjusted.
Initially, the parallel - bond tensile strength was provisionally set to a high value of 0.7 times the compressive strength (σ) to ensure that the simulation remained in the elastic or minor-damage regime where the strength effect was secondary. Then, the particle contact modulus parameter was systematically varied between 0.4 and 1.2 times the experimental elastic modulus (E), and the simulated effective elastic modulus was compared with the experimental value. As shown in Fig. 5(a), at −20 °C, when the particle contact modulus parameter was 0.8E, the deviation from the target experimental value was less than 2.5 %, which was the optimal value for this parameter.

After determining the particle contact modulus, the elastic modulus was fixed at 0.8E, and the parallel-bond tensile strength was varied between 0.1σ and 0.7σ. Simulations at −20 °C showed that when the parallel-bond tensile strength was 0.4σ, it provided the best agreement with the experimental stress-strain curves, with deviations in peak stress and elastic modulus of less than 5.2 %, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The parameter determination process under other temperature conditions followed the same staged calibration method as that at −20 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Analysis of the stress‒strain relationships at different temperatures
As depicted in Fig. 6(a), the experimental results for ice exhibit considerable dispersion, a challenge that has similarly affected the research conducted by Lian et al. (2017), Li et al. (2011); (Zhang et al., 2022c). Their studies have indicated that the intrinsic randomness during the nucleation and growth stages of ice is the key factor leading to variability in the experimental microstructure, which in turn affects the stability of the physical properties. To increase the accuracy of the experimental results, Deng et al. (2020) investigated the dispersion issue related to the compressive strength of ice and reported that conducting six repeated tests can effectively yield a more stable average uniaxial compressive strength value for ice. Consequently, in this study, the experiment was repeated six times for the section described in subsection 2.2, and the results obtained are as follows.

Fig. 6. Stress‒strain relationships at different temperatures.

Fig. 6 (a) shows that as the temperature (T) gradually decreases from −12 °C to −28 °C, the compressive strength (σ) of ice considerably increases, and the rate of increase accelerates with a further decrease in temperature. Data fitting analyses were performed via linear, quadratic polynomial, and exponential function models to explore the relationship between the compressive strength of ice and temperature, with the fitting results illustrated in Fig. 6(b) and Table 1. Comparing the fitting efficacy of different function models revealed that the exponential function model demonstrated superior fitting characteristics, characterized by relatively small fitting residuals and an absence of significant systematic deviations in the residual distribution (with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.97267 and a residual sum of squares of 0.00569). On the basis of this analysis, the exponential function model can be considered empirically optimal for describing the relationship, particularly within the temperature range of −12 °C to −28 °C, where its applicability has been thoroughly validated.

(6)	0.97267	0.00569
Furthermore, from a physical mechanism perspective, the exponential function model can directly capture the exponential increase in hydrogen bond energy with decreasing temperature, a characteristic that aligns well with the hydrogen bond energy‒temperature relationship revealed by molecular dynamics simulations (Galamba, 2013). Within the temperature range of −12 °C to −28 °C, the model exhibited high predictive accuracy. Moreover, when the temperature extends to even lower regions (up to −40 °C), the model predicts a continued upward trend in the compressive strength of ice, a prediction that is consistent with experimental observations indicating an increase in ice brittleness with decreasing temperature (Schulson, 2001). Eq. (6) is a local empirical model for a fixed strain rate (1.33 × 10−2 s−1), and its predicted values are used to quickly estimate the strength in the −12 °C to −28 °C range and to guide parameter assignments in related simulations or analyses.
As shown in Fig. 6(c), the ice stress rapidly peaks and then abruptly decreases, which is attributed to rapid stress concentration and crack propagation within the ice crystals (Shekov and Kolesnikov, 2023; Wang et al., 2020). With decreasing temperature, the compressive strength of ice at high strain rates increases considerably, aligning with the physical characteristics of enhanced intercrystalline bonding and structural stabilization at low temperatures.
3.2. Crack evolution during uniaxial compression
Detailed analysis of the images revealed that the deformation characteristics of ice exhibited a high degree of similarity under the same strain rate (Deng et al., 2020). Therefore, this study focused on the brittle deformation behavior of ice in uniaxial compression experiments. Fig. 7 presents the stress‒strain curves and unique failure patterns of ice under high strain rate conditions. Using a camera, two crucial stages of ice sample failure are captured: the initial point and the final point. As shown in Fig. 7, ice samples primarily undergo splitting failure under high strain rates (Akurati et al., 2021). This failure mode closely aligns with the loading direction, where the primary crack destabilizes and propagates rapidly, traversing the entire sample from top to bottom. This failure occurs exceptionally swiftly, with almost no precursor, resulting in brittle fracture characterized by distinct longitudinal splitting and an immediate loss of original load-bearing capacity (Hertzberg, 1976). The sample fragmented into distinct large pieces, with internal cracking observed within the fragmented blocks.

Fig. 8 shows the failure process captured by a high-speed camera. The brittle failure process of ice is described as follows: In the initial stage of the failure process, due to the suppression of dislocation slip under high strain rates, energy is directly released through cracks. As clearly observable from points (1) and (3) in Fig. 8, minute cracks begin to sporadically appear on the ice surface, presenting as white thin lines or spots in the image. The emergence of these microcracks signifies the onset of local damage within the ice structure, indicating the gradual formation of microcracks. As the loading process continues, once crack nucleation occurs, the cracks propagate rapidly under the tensile stress generated by uniaxial compression. The inherent complexity and anisotropy of the ice crystal structure result in the cracks not following simple linear paths during propagation. Instead, the crack propagation paths often exhibit wing-like or other irregular shapes, as demonstrated by points (2) and (4) in Fig. 8. With the further extension of the cracks, adjacent cracks may merge, a process that gradually deteriorates the structural integrity of the ice sample. Once the cracks reach a critical extent, a distinct longitudinal splitting of the ice sample occurs in a specific direction. This phenomenon is evident in Fig. 8 at point (5), where the mechanical properties of the ice sample have completely collapsed, rendering it unable to sustain any further loading.

3.3. Fractal characteristics of brittle crack propagation
Fractal fragmentation analysis of ice brittleness failure mechanisms offers insights into the underlying physical principles governing the ice failure process. This study, through the integration of electronic balance screening experiments with fractal geometry theory, establishes for the first time a quantitative relationship between ice fragmentation patterns and fractal dimensions under temperature control. This study provides an innovative analytical tool for the design of polar engineering materials and the study of glacier dynamics.
Fig. 9 shows the mass fractions of debris fragments with various particle sizes, which were obtained via an electronic balance. Nevertheless, on the basis of the data characteristics depicted in Fig. 9, the temperature variation trend remains ambiguous, with the relevant information lacking sufficient clarity. To further analyze the fragmentation size distribution under high strain rates, the mass fraction was calculated by dividing the sieved mass of each aperture size by the total mass. A double-logarithmic plot of 
 versus 
 was constructed, resulting in Fig. 10(a), to quantify the scale invariance law of ice fragmentation. To further investigate this relationship, the rate of change in the fractal dimension curves for each crack set was calculated via linear fitting methods, as presented in Fig. 10(b). The 
 values of all the fitting lines approached 1, rigorously validating the applicability of the fractal model. Finally, the fractal dimension gradient curve is presented in Fig. 10(c). The fractal dimension of fragmented ice after breaking reflects the failure process of the sample, and the varying temperatures directly influence the fragmentation distribution of the ice samples. As observed in Fig. 10(c), the logarithmic values of the characteristic size 
 positively correlate with the logarithmic values of the mass fraction 
 across different temperatures. With increasing temperature, the fractal dimension also tends to increase. When the temperature decreases from −12 °C to −28 °C, the average fractal dimension of the fragmentation decreases from 2.075 to 2.242, a reduction of 16.7 %. Notably, the fractal dimension, as a key indicator for quantifying fracture complexity, exhibits a growth rate of only 0.0037/°C within the temperature range of −28 °C to −20 °C; however, when the temperature is above −20 °C, the growth rate increases to 0.0172/°C. This nonlinear response is directly related to the dynamics of hydrogen bond network reconstruction in ice crystals, corresponding to a phase transition from a rigid dense state to a flexible reconfigurable state of the ice lattice structure.

The relationship is described via an exponential function model, which is consistent with Eq. (7) in Section 3.1, where the compressive strength‒temperature relationship is also modeled exponentially. The fitted curve of the exponential function is illustrated in Fig. 10(c), and the formula is presented as follows:

DT represents the fractal dimension of ice at temperature T. The high goodness-of-fit (R2 = 0.98139) and low residuals (1.59524 × 10−4) of the exponential function validate its effectiveness. The experimental data indicate that as DT decreases, the complexity of ice cracks transitions from multilevel branching to a single primary shear plane. This observation aligns with classical mechanical behavior, where material brittleness increases and crack paths simplify. These findings offer a new constitutive parameter for ice shelf fracture predictions, and to increase the accuracy of such predictions, the following measures can be implemented. First, surface temperature data are acquired through remote sensing inversion techniques, and when combined with a DT regression model, a spatial distribution map of ice-crack complexity is generated, which facilitates an intuitive understanding of the spatial distribution of ice cracks. Second, a random forest model is trained using characteristic variables, including the DT regression model, local temperature gradient, and stress rate, ultimately enabling the output of the ice-shelf fracture probability and thereby providing a more scientific and accurate basis for ice-shelf fracture prediction.
In the experiments conducted above, the fundamental reason for the negative correlation between the fractal dimension and compressive strength lies in the enhancement of brittle fracture mechanisms under the combined effects of low temperature and dynamic loading. As the temperature decreases from −12 °C to −28 °C, the rigidity of the hydrogen bond network in ice increases, leading to a densification of the lattice structure and the suppression of microscopic plastic deformation. Consequently, the compressive strength increases from 2.85 MPa to 3.71 MPa. Simultaneously, high strain rates limit the formation of crack branches, forcing fracture energy to concentrate on the rapid propagation of a single main crack, resulting in simpler and more regular fracture surfaces (the fractal dimension decreases from 2.24216 to 2.07531). This negative correlation aligns with Griffith's energy release theory for brittle materials: the lower the complexity of the crack path (fractal dimension), the more energy dissipation is concentrated at the tip of the main crack, leading to a higher critical fracture stress and systematically increasing compressive strength as the temperature decreases (Alessi and Ulloa, 2023; Ma et al., 2025). This finding reveals the microscopic energy optimization mechanism of brittle fracture in ice under extreme conditions, providing a crucial mechanical basis for the design of impact-resistant materials in polar engineering and the prediction of glacier dynamic fracture.
3.4. PFC simulation of brittle crack propagation
To investigate the uniaxial compressive behavior of ice samples under various temperature conditions, a series of laboratory experiments was conducted. However, the brittle failure of ice often occurs too abruptly, making it challenging to capture its detailed characteristics. Fortunately, PFC2D numerical simulation technology is effective in simulating the cracking features of ice materials. Establishing a clear link between macrobehavior (including axial stress‒strain curves, peak strength, elastic modulus, and ultimate failure mode) and microparameters is essential for validating the particle characteristics employed in this simulation technique. This process relies on utilizing the macrobehavior exhibited by ice under uniaxial compression in the laboratory as a benchmark for calibrating the microparameters.
As shown in Fig. 11, the simulated axial stress‒strain curves, peak strengths, and elastic moduli of the ice samples at high strain rates and different temperatures are in high agreement with the experimental data, with a maximum discrepancy of only 6.603 %. This outcome not only robustly validates the efficacy of PFC2D technology in modeling the uniaxial compressive behavior of ice materials but also establishes a solid foundation for subsequent in-depth investigations into the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of ice.

Additionally, Fig. 12 shows that the damage patterns of ice in the simulations closely match the experimental failure modes. These findings validate the reliability of PFC2D in simulating the uniaxial compression behavior of ice and provide a robust foundation for investigating its crack propagation and damage mechanisms.

Fig. 12. Comparison of experimental and simulated failure morphologies.

Fig. 13(a) presents the simulated stress‒strain relationship, total crack count, tensile cracks, and shear cracks. As the axial strain increases, the tensile and shear crack counts tend to increase. The key turning points on the crack count variation curve closely correspond to those reflecting the elastoplastic properties of the material in the stress‒strain curve, revealing the intrinsic relationship between crack evolution and the mechanical response of the material. The experimental images captured by the high-speed camera, as shown in Fig. 7, make it challenging to discern the development pattern of cracks prior to the peak stress; only the rapid propagation of cracks after the peak stress can be observed. The simulation results depicted in Fig. 13(a) indicate that, on the basis of the characteristics of crack count growth with axial strain, the crack evolution process can be categorized into three stages: initial crack nucleation, slow linear propagation, and rapid nonlinear expansion. The initial crack nucleation stage (0–2) is closely associated with the linear elastic phase of the stress‒strain curve, characterized by a total crack count less than five and a balanced distribution of tensile and shear cracks at a 1:1 ratio at the 0.75 peak (2). Cracks subsequently enter the slow linear propagation stage (2–4), during which tensile and shear cracks begin to increase linearly at a relatively gradual rate as the axial stress gradually approaches the peak stress. At peak (4), there are 175 cracks with a tensile-to-shear crack ratio of 111/64, and the proportion of tensile cracks increases to 63.5 %. Following this stage, a rapid nonlinear expansion stage of cracks (4–8) is observed, where a considerable number of cracks initiate and propagate rapidly at a substantially increased rate after the axial strain exceeds the peak strain. At 0.1 times the peak stress postpeak (8), the total crack count reaches 3936 with a tensile-to-shear crack ratio of 3053/883, and the tensile crack dominance increases to 77.5 %, which is spatially and temporally correlated with the macroscopic failure of the sample.

Crack Evolution Process: (1) prepeak-0.5 σ, 0 cracks; (2) prepeak-0.75 σ, 2 cracks, tensile/shear = 1/1; (3) prepeak-0.95 σ, 23 cracks, tensile/shear = 8/15; (4) peak-σ, 175 cracks, tensile/shear = 111/64; (5) postpeak-0.95 σ, 1068 cracks, tensile/shear = 728/340; (6) postpeak-0.75 σ, 2197 cracks, tensile/shear = 1586/611; (7) postpeak-0.5 σ, 3159 cracks, tensile/shear = 2391/768; and (8) postpeak-0.1 σ, 3936 cracks, tensile/shear = 3053/883.

For a more intuitive observation of crack evolution patterns, simulations were conducted via the PFC2D model. Fig. 13(b) illustrates the progressive evolution of microcracks at the prepeak, peak, and postpeak stress stages of the simulation, with tensile cracks marked in green and shear cracks marked in red. During the initial crack nucleation process (0–2), the number of cracks is low, and cracks are barely visible in the figure. As the axial stress increases (2–4), the crack count gradually increases, but the expansion of cracks and their concentrated areas does not accelerate. At peak strength, the crack count continues to increase, with some cracks in the middle of the sample merging, expanding, and converging, primarily in the upper right center and lower left regions. Postpeak, the crack count continuously increases over time, with cracks in weaker areas interconnecting to form throughgoing main crack zones. The length and number of cracks continue to increase, with crack convergence and local failure leading to a sharp drop in strength and sample failure, where tensile cracks become the dominant force in crack propagation.
Fig. 14(a) provides a detailed depiction of the dynamic evolution of force chains and crack growth within the sample during compression, with green lines indicating compressive forces, red lines indicating tensile forces, and black lines representing cracks. By closely observing the thickness of these lines, further inferences can be made regarding the distribution of contact force magnitudes, which is a crucial parameter reflecting the internal stress state of a sample. Prior to loading, the contact chains within the sample are uniformly distributed in various directions. As the load increases, the distribution of contact force chains gradually shifts along the load transfer direction, with axial contact forces considerably intensifying and far exceeding lateral contact forces, reflecting stress concentration during compression. Upon reaching its load-bearing limit and failing, the sample exhibits a notable phenomenon: chains bearing larger contact forces exhibit a high degree of concentration, primarily in the region where the sample ultimately fractures, whereas other parts of the sample bear negligible contact forces. This phenomenon not only reveals the microscopic mechanism of sample failure but also provides an important basis for determining the location of sample damage. After sample failure, strong contact force chains form considerable stress concentration zones near the fracture surface, primarily along the slip direction of the particles adjacent to the fracture surface, further confirming the failure mode of the sample during compression.

Apart from the evolution of force chains and cracks, insights into the failure process of ice can also be derived by observing the bonding state and displacement field of ice particles, as illustrated in Fig. 14(b) and (c), which depict the microscopic changes in ice particles under stress. Variations in the bond state values (i.e., pb-states) within parallel bond groups provide direct evidence of the interaction status between particles. The transition of the bonding state between particles from 3 (bonded particles) to 2 (shear failure between particles) or 1 (tensile failure between particles) signifies the failure of interparticle interactions and is a crucial indicator of internal damage accumulation and failure onset within the sample. As the axial strain continues to increase, the displacement between particles gradually increases, accompanied by the progressive rupture of interparticle bonds. Notably, bond failure is particularly evident near the shear bands, as shown in Fig. 14(b). Furthermore, by observing the particle displacement field, a more intuitive visualization of the progressive failure process of ice is obtained, as depicted in Fig. 14(c). Prior to reaching peak stress, deformation in the sample is relatively minor, with small displacements between particles. However, following peak stress, the sample exhibited considerable deformation and gradually formed macroscopic shear bands. During this process, the particles near the shear bands undergo substantial displacement or deformation, and the bonding state between the particles largely fails, indicating the ultimate occurrence of sample failure.
The specific impact of temperature on the failure modes of ice materials is further explored, with Fig. 15 illustrating the actual crack distribution in the ice samples after uniaxial compression testing. At temperatures of −12 °C and −16 °C, the samples failed under uniaxial compression, forming a main rupture plane (MRP) along with several localized secondary rupture zones. Macrocracks initiate and propagate at multiple locations, with the rupture concentration zone (RCZ) being primarily concentrated on the main rupture plane. Upon test completion, the samples exhibited a composite failure mode characterized by overall shear damage and localized splitting damage, resulting in rupture planes with relatively large inclination angles.

Fig. 15. Rupture morphology.

When the temperature decreases to −20 °C, the failure mode of the sample transitions to overall shear failure along a single shear plane. As the temperature continued to decrease to −24 °C and −28 °C, this failure mode remained stable and did not change again. Across the five tested temperatures ranging from −12 °C to −28 °C, the inclination angles of the rupture planes formed after compression testing in the ice samples were approximately 85°, 75°, 52°, 49°, and 47°. As the temperature decreases, the inclination angle of the fracture surface gradually decreases, but the rate of decrease gradually slows. This phenomenon occurs because as the strength of the ice sample increases, the axial stress required for failure increases, and the end friction effect that needs to be overcome becomes more considerable.
The uniaxial compression tests reveal specific failure characteristics of the ice samples, as shown in Fig. 16. When the maximum load-bearing capacity is reached, the internal structure of the ice samples is damaged, yet the samples largely retain their original shape and outline. Subsequently, cracks propagate within the regions of greater crack concentration in the samples, exacerbating the damage and ultimately leading to the formation of internal macroscopic fracture zones. The crack distribution in the ice samples at 0.1 times the peak stress after peak strength was reached was documented across various temperature conditions. Specifically, at −12 °C and −16 °C, cracks exhibit a λ-like distribution pattern within the ice samples. For samples subjected to lower temperatures (−20 °C, −24 °C, and −28 °C), cracks tend to concentrate along a diagonal direction (from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner). As the test temperature continues to decrease, the crack distribution pattern becomes increasingly dense and focused.

Fig. 16. Mesoscale cracks.

A detailed analysis at the microscopic mechanistic level revealed that the transformation of crack distribution patterns at low temperatures originates from the inherent mechanism of the increased rigidity of the hydrogen bond network with decreasing temperature (Galamba, 2013). Relevant studies have demonstrated (Dougherty, 1998) that as the temperature decreases, the vibration energy of hydrogen bonds within ice crystals diminishes, leading to a considerable increase in lattice rigidity. This change at the microscopic level exerts a decisive influence on the propagation path of cracks, suppressing the random expansion of crack branches and forcing the energy to concentrate on a single primary crack path. Consequently, more concentrated shear bands are formed, as illustrated in Fig. 16(c)–(e).
Despite the manifestation of macrocracks at various locations within the samples, which exhibit diverse distributions and morphologies, the focus of the RCZ remains on the MRP. This rupture plane plays a pivotal role by effectively hindering further particle movement along the loading direction, thereby compelling these particles to undergo greater displacement circumferentially around the sample, resulting in a prominent expansion phenomenon. During compression at relatively warm temperatures of −12 °C and −16 °C, the particle displacements at the extremities of the ice samples generate four uniformly distributed regions of outward-extending displacement vectors, as shown in Fig. 17. These regions, labeled with displacement vectors V1 to V4, signify distinct displacement directions and trends. Specifically, in the upper-left region of the sample, the particles tend to displace toward the left center, forming the V1 displacement vector; conversely, in the upper-right region, the particles shift toward the right center, forming the V2 displacement vector. Simultaneously, the other two regions of the sample develop displacement vectors in the V3 and V4 directions, collectively constituting a comprehensive displacement vector field. Notably, within this displacement vector field, areas with fewer rupture phenomena exhibit a more balanced distribution of particle displacement vectors, accompanied by stable directional changes. However, near the rupture-concentrated zones, the situation drastically differs. Here, the distribution of the particle displacement vectors becomes intricate, with considerable directional changes, forming a zone of dramatic vector displacement (VDZ). The emergence of this zone underscores the complexity of the forces acting on the sample near the MRP and the nonuniformity of the stress states.

Fig. 17. Displacement vector.

As the temperature decreases to −20 °C, −24 °C, and −28 °C, the displacement vectors exhibited during the compression of the ice samples become more uniform, as shown in Fig. 17. These displacement vectors clearly elucidate a mesoscale shear failure mechanism dominated by a single rupture plane. The displacement vectors at these colder temperatures are more ordered and regular, potentially because of the increased brittleness of ice at lower temperatures, resulting in a more focused and singular rupture process. On the basis of the comprehensive analysis, ice clearly undergoes a series of intricate meso-failure stages during destruction.
A thorough investigation into the underlying mechanism behind the changes in displacement vectors reveals that the homogenization of displacement vectors (Fig. 17(c)–(e)) is closely related to the temperature sensitivity of ice crystal plastic deformation. According to the Jordaan (2001) theory of ice crystal deformation, at high temperatures (e.g., −12 °C), basal slip in ice crystals is active, resulting in uneven local plastic deformation and triggering the multidirectionality of displacement vectors (as exemplified by the dispersed distributions of V1–V4 in Fig. 17(a)). At low temperatures (such as −28 °C), the slip of the substrate surface is suppressed, and deformation is mainly coordinated through brittle fracture at grain boundaries, which promotes the directional arrangement of particle displacement along the main shear plane (Fig. 17(e)).
4. Conclusions
This study aims to systematically elucidate the brittle failure mechanism of ice under uniaxial compression (ranging from −12 °C to −28 °C) through the integration of fractal theory and simulations conducted via PFC2D. Particular emphasis is placed on investigating the regulatory effects of temperature on crack propagation patterns, fragment distributions, and macroscopic mechanical responses.
(1)
The innovative application of fractal theory in this study quantifies the complexity of ice fracture, utilizing the fractal dimension as a quantitative indicator of the evolution of brittle ice fractures. As the temperature decreased from −12 °C to −28 °C, the fractal dimension decreased by 16.7 % from 2.242 to 2.075, owing to the considerable simplification of the crack path caused by the rigidity of the hydrogen bond network at low temperatures. This research provides a novel parametric framework for the impact-resistant design of materials in cold-region ocean engineering and early warning of ice shelf fractures.
(2)
The reliability of PFC2D simulations has been validated and applied to simulate the macroscopic mechanical response and dynamic crack evolution of ice. With an error of less than 6.6 % compared with the experimental conditions, the simulations reveal that tensile cracks dominate brittle fractures. This research provides strong numerical support for sea ice dynamics simulations and coastal ice load predictions.
(3)
A significant negative correlation is observed between the fractal dimension and compressive strength. At lower temperatures, the reduction in crack complexity (i.e., decrease in fractal dimension) facilitates energy concentration in the propagation of primary cracks, thereby increasing the material strength from 2.85 MPa to 3.71 MPa. This research provides crucial theoretical foundations for energy optimization in anti-icing designs for ocean engineering structures.
(4)
Simulation studies indicate that decreasing temperatures alter the failure mode of ice, which transitions from mixed fracture (with an inclination angle of 85°) to single shear failure (with an inclination angle of 47°). An analysis of the displacement fields reveals that the particle displacement vectors tend to be distributed uniformly at lower temperatures.
Although the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the brittle failure of ice at low temperatures and their temperature-dependent characteristics have been preliminarily elucidated in this study, the following limitations remain. First, the experimental temperature range (−12 °C to −28 °C) does not encompass the critical temperature regime associated with the ductile-to-brittle transition of ice (e.g., approximately −5 °C). Second, the selection of microparameters in PFC2D simulations involves inherent subjectivity. Although we calibrated the parameters through a ‘trial-and-error’ approach, achieving less than 6.6 % deviation between simulated and experimental stress-strain curves, the determination of microparameters (such as contact stiffness ratio, friction coefficient, etc.) still relies on empirical assumptions, which may affect the generalizability of the simulation results. Third, fragment analysis based on fractal theory predominantly focuses on the millimeter scale, potentially overlooking the nonlinear features of nanoscale structures during the evolution of microscopic cracks. Despite these limitations, the research findings exhibit considerable application potential in fields such as the optimization of polar engineering structures, early warning of glacial dynamic disasters, and the development of novel anti-icing materials.
