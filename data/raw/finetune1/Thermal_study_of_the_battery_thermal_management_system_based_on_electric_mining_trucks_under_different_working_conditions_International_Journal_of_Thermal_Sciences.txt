Abstract
To address the thermal safety issues of batteries in electric mining trucks under harsh mining conditions—characterized by high loads and a 15 °C day-night temperature difference—this study proposes a collaborative battery thermal management system (TLCP-BTMS) that integrates topology-optimized liquid-cooling channels (TLC) and composite phase change materials (CPCM) with a 10 % mass fraction of expanded graphite. The AVL-Cruise software was employed to simulate the battery output current characteristics under three operating conditions: full load, no load, and the China Heavy-duty Truck Driving Cycle-Dump Truck (CHTC-D) cycle. The simulated current characteristics were then converted into battery heat generation data. Meanwhile, the COMSOL software was used to analyze the battery thermal performance, with maximum temperature (Tmax) and maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax) adopted as core evaluation metrics. Results indicate that under the condition of 40 °C ambient temperature and full-load without cooling, the battery's Tmax reached 81.31 °C and ΔTmax reached 5.76 °C, both exceeding the safety thresholds. However, with the activation of TLCP-BTMS, Tmax of the battery under full-load decreased by 43.35 %–46.06 °C, and ΔTmax was reduced to 4.85 °C. Under no-load condition, the battery's Tmax decreased by 40.79 %–44.88 °C. For the CHTC-D cycle, the battery's Tmax was stabilized at approximately 40 °C, with ΔTmax not exceeding 3.1 °C. Compared with liquid cooling and phase change material cooling, TLCP-BTMS can reduce the Tmax of the battery pack by 20.96 % and 30.12 % respectively, while ensuring that the ΔTmax is within 5 °C, verifying its excellent thermal performance.

1. Introduction
Traditional mine trucks play a vital role in mining loading and transportation but typically run on diesel, consuming energy and causing air pollution. With the promotion of green mine construction, the application of electric mining trucks is increasing. During uphill travel, high-speed driving, heavy loading, and other practical scenarios, electric mining trucks' battery packs inevitably undergo high-rate discharge, generating substantial heat, the heat cannot be dissipated in a timely manner, which will lead to increased battery temperature, and then affect the battery performance life, and even lead to safety issues [1]. According to the previous studies, to ensure the battery works safely, its maximum temperature difference should be controlled within 5 °C [2,3].
In real-world driving scenarios, specific road conditions or complex driving profiles significantly affect the output characteristics of electric vehicle (EV) drive motors, inducing variations in key output parameters. These dynamic changes in motor output directly modulate the current output characteristics of the battery pack, thereby ultimately determining the intensity and patterns of heat generation within the pack. Changes in road gradient and frequent shifts in driving conditions substantially affect the motor's output power, thereby influencing battery pack heat generation. Consequently, the thermal management requirements for the power battery pack vary significantly under different operating conditions [4]. Additionally, different road conditions correspond to distinct driving patterns; for instance, urban driving involves frequent start-stop cycles and other varying modes. All these diverse driving scenarios exert varying influences on the thermal performance of battery packs. Relevant research data indicates that the power loss ratio of the motor under the race driving cycle condition is 5.23 %, while this ratio reaches 7.57 % under the World Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) driving condition. Additionally, due to increased battery internal resistance, battery heat generation under race driving cycle condition is 73 % higher than under conventional working conditions [5]. Currently, there is a study that uses three typical driving cycle conditions: the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFT), the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), and the United States Government's Light Vehicle Drive Cycle (US06) to conduct experiments and systematically explores how driving conditions influence the thermal characteristics of the battery [6]. The results showed that the battery pack exhibits the most significant temperature rise under US06 cycle condition, followed by HWFT, with the smallest temperature increase observed under UDDS cycles, demonstrating that different working conditions can substantially affect battery heat generation. Other studies have demonstrated that different driving modes and ambient temperatures affect both the thermal management and energy consumption of electric vehicle batteries. At an ambient temperature of −15 °C, energy efficiency decreases by 67 % during urban driving and 42 % on highways; conversely, at 35 °C, energy consumption increases by 24 % during urban driving and 12 % on highways [7]. This underscores the critical importance of battery thermal management systems in electric vehicles. In complex mining terrain, electric mining trucks frequently encounter real-world driving conditions such as continuous uphill/downhill operation and heavy loads during mining operations. These sustained slope operations and high-load tasks subject the battery packs to ultra-high-speed deep discharges, causing rapid temperature increases that pose new challenges to the battery packs' heat dissipation capabilities. Low ambient temperatures increase internal resistance and heat generation during current discharge, while high ambient temperatures reduce the system's heat dissipation efficiency. The substantial environmental stress from diurnal temperature fluctuations, combined with heavy transportation loads and high-intensity charge-discharge cycles, subjects the battery to continuous thermal fatigue. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity for the design of battery thermal management systems (BTMS) capable of rational temperature regulation to ensure batteries operate normally within optimal temperature ranges and enhance driving safety of mining trucks.
BTMS is primarily categorized into active, passive, and hybrid types [8]. Active systems regulate heat through mechanical mechanisms, such as forced air cooling via fans [9] and forced liquid cooling using pumps and cold plates [10]. Passive thermal management systems, by contrast, require no additional power consumption [11] and enhance heat dissipation capabilities through heat pipes [12], heat sinks [13], and phase change materials (PCM) [14,15]. Hybrid systems integrate the advantages of the first two types, including air-coupled liquid cooling [16], air-coupled phase change materials [17], and liquid cooling-coupled phase change materials [18]. In current thermal management applications for mining trucks, active liquid cooling based on cold plates is widely utilized. Owing to liquids' higher heat transfer coefficients and thermal capacities compared to air, this technology enables rapid heat dissipation, maintains stable temperatures of core components, and improves battery pack temperature uniformity. Furthermore, the compact structure of liquid cooling systems makes them suitable for large-capacity mining truck battery packs, allowing for higher energy density within limited spaces while reducing vehicle body modification costs.
For traditional battery liquid cooling systems in electric mining trucks, regular cold plate designs are predominantly employed, with performance enhancements achieved through the optimization of channel parameters. Traditional cold plates are primarily rectangular [19] or serpentine [20], while U-shaped [21,22], cavity [23], and vortex [24] designs have also been developed to improve flow and cooling performance. A study showed that after optimizing the spiral channel cold plate angle, the Nusselt number of the battery energy storage system was reduced by 8.66 %, the temperature standard deviation of the heat transfer surface was reduced by 2.62 %, and the pressure drop was reduced by 17.4 % [25]. However, these methods struggle to overcome inherent drawbacks such as high flow resistance and large temperature gradients. In recent years, channel topology optimization, which targets parameters like heat transfer rate and pressure drop and integrates iterative algorithms, has emerged as a new research direction. Since the topology optimization theory was first proposed in 1988 [26], this approach has been extended to multi-flow-field problems and applied in battery thermal management. Related studies have employed multi-objective topology optimization to design liquid channels, achieving a Nusselt number of 5.91 under the inlet mass flow rate of 1.5 × 10−3 kg/s, representing a 15.6 % improvement over rectangular channels and superior overall performance [27]. Another study compared dual-outlet topology-optimized cooling plates with traditional straight channels, finding that maximum temperature was reduced by 1.185 K, average temperature by 0.604 K, maximum surface temperature difference by 9.04 %, and pressure drop by 5.32 % [28]. This demonstrates that topology optimization can overcome limitations of traditional design, effectively enhancing thermal safety and energy efficiency of batteries.
However, single liquid cooling systems have limitations: the thermal performance relies on medium circulation, where pipeline blockages or pump power fluctuations can reduce efficiency and hinder handling of instantaneous high heat loads; fixed pipeline layouts make precise adjustment of heat dissipation in different regions difficult, often resulting in temperature non-uniformity; and medium leakage disables thermal management functions, leading to overheating damage of components. Phase change materials (PCM)-coupled liquid cooling solutions can address these issues: A hybrid system integrating wavy cold plates with tubular Composite Phase Change Materials (CPCMs) was proposed, which reduced maximum battery temperature by 22.2 %, battery pack temperature difference by 16.8 %, and peak temperature during actual driving cycles by 20.89 % in comparison with traditional liquid cooling [29]. Additionally, a PCM-coupled liquid cooling system achieved temperature reductions of 44.2 %, 30.1 %, and 5.4 % respectively when compared to air cooling, conventional liquid cooling, and standalone PCMs cooling [30]. The coupled thermal management technology of PCM and liquid cooling exhibits significant applicability in electric mining trucks under harsh mining conditions. PCM buffer localized transient heat peaks to reduce liquid cooling loads, while liquid cooling continuously dissipates stored heat. Ample truck space accommodates subsystem integration complexities, and rational design synergizes PCM passive stability with liquid cooling active efficiency to tackle dynamic mining heat generation effectively.
A review of research on BTMS under complex driving conditions reveals that existing studies primarily focus on matching the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) conditions [31,32]. Research on battery thermal management for electric mining trucks operating in mining environments remains relatively scarce.
In fact, designing a thermal management system for electric mining trucks that matches their driving conditions can effectively reduce battery thermal safety risks during operation. Therefore, this paper designs a synergistic TLCP-BTMS integrating Topology-Optimized Liquid Cooling Channels (TLC) with Composite Phase Change Materials (CPCM). The primary work and achievements are as follows.

2.1.2. Calculation of battery thermophysical parameters
Because lithium-ion batteries are composed of many different materials and their internal structures are complex, the thermophysical properties of the batteries are inhomogeneous in spatial distribution. Therefore, it is very difficult to carry out accurate thermal analysis and modeling of batteries, especially in the modeling process of heat conduction, thermal convection and thermal radiation, which needs to consider the interaction of multiple layers and multiphysics. When studying the thermal management of batteries, it is necessary to simplify the battery thermal model to be effective in analyzing it while retaining the key thermal characteristics and operating characteristics of the battery as much as possible.
In constructing the simplified thermal model of lithium-ion batteries, the following assumptions and constraints were made to simplify the complexity of the problem while ensuring the rationality and certain accuracy of the model.
(1)
The internal materials of the battery are uniformly distributed.
(2)
Except for internal resistance, the thermophysical properties of materials, including density and specific heat capacity, remain constant.
(3)
The operating current inside the battery is uniformly distributed.
(4)
The electrolyte inside the battery is stationary, and in heat transfer analysis, heat conduction and convection heat transfer are the primary mechanisms considered, with thermal radiation excluded.
Based on the above assumptions, the battery energy conservation equation applicable to square lithium-ion batteries can be established. The specific mathematical expression is given in the following formula (1):
(1)
Where, ρ0 is the density of the battery, kg/m3, Cp is the specific heat capacity of the battery, J/(kg·K), t is the charging and discharging time of the battery, s, λx、λy、λz are the thermal conductivity in the x, y, and z directions, W/(m·K).
During the modeling study of lithium-ion single cell batteries, the key thermophysical property parameters must be determined first. Due to the complexity of the internal structure of the battery, most of the thermophysical parameters are difficult to obtain by direct measurement. Therefore, in this study, the series-parallel thermal resistance method is used for equivalent calculation, and the thermal conductivity is calculated as follows:
(2)
(3)
(4)
Where, X, Y, Z represent the length of the cell in the x, y, z directions, m, respectively, dxi, dyi, dzi represent the thickness of the cell in each direction, m.
The specific heat capacity of the battery is affected by both ambient temperature and material composition. In order to reduce the complexity of the calculation, this study selects the room temperature condition as the analyzing condition, and determines the integrated specific heat capacity value through the weighted average method, and the specific calculation relationship is shown in Eq. (5):
(5)
Where, c is the specific heat capacity, J/(kg·K), m is the mass, kg.
The density is calculated as shown in equation (6):
(6)
Where, ρi refers to the density of different materials inside the cell, kg/m3, Vi is the corresponding volume of different materials, m3.
Based on the above equations, the calculated thermo-physical parameters are specifically shown in Table 2.

Parameters	Value
Density	2550 kg/m3
Specific heat capacity	1102.8 J/(kg·K)
λx = λy	25.4 W/(m·K)
λz	1.32 W/(m·K)
2.1.3. Meshing and model validation of batteries
In this study, COMSOL 6.2 is selected for simulation to construct the mesh model of lithium-ion cells, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The ambient temperature is set to 25 °C, and the thermal characteristics of the single cell under multiple discharge rates of 0.5 C, 1 C, 1.5 C and 2 C are investigated; with the heat transfer boundary conditions neglecting the contact thermal resistance, natural convection is used on the outer wall of the cell, and the convection heat transfer coefficient is 5 W/(m2·K); the time domain is adopted in the transient model, with the time step set to 1 s, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2(b).

The number of grids directly affects the computational accuracy of numerical simulation, for which the grid independence verification must be carried out. Tmax and ΔTmax at the termination moment of battery discharge are used as the benchmark parameters for verification, and five models with different grid numbers are comparatively analyzed under the working conditions of 30 °C ambient temperature and 2 C discharge rate. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the achieved values of Tmax and ΔTmax tend to stabilize as the number of grids increases from 220100 to 408182 with fluctuations in the range of 3 %. After the comprehensive evaluation of computational efficiency and accuracy, the optimal grid number is determined to be 220100, and the grid quality is 0.1879, which meets the requirements of numerical simulation. The iterative convergence analysis shows that the computational residuals of the control equations are all less than 10−4, and the residuals of energy conservation are less than 10−6, and a 1 s time step is used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. In order to verify the reliability and accuracy of the simulation model, the validation process of the model is essential. In the work of Xu et al. [33], a battery heat production study was carried out using a square LiFePO4 battery at a discharge rate of 5 C. The ambient temperature was 293.15 K. The results of the validation in comparison with the existing studies are shown in Fig. 3(b). The relative error between the simulation data and the experimental data is always within 5 % and the difference is less than 5 K, which indicates that the model can simulate the thermal behavior of the battery under the experimental conditions. The reason for this difference is that the actual conditions were simplified in the simulation process and the mathematical model and boundary conditions used were slightly different, which also verifies the accuracy of the model.

2.2.2. Mathematical modeling of BTMS
The liquid thermal management system established in this study generally consists of a liquid channel and a coolant, which flows in the flow channel to exchange heat with the battery. Therefore, for the coolant, the control equations are divided into two parts: the flow equation and the heat transfer equation, and the specific control equations are shown in Eq. (7)∼(9):
(7)
(8)
(9)
Where, ρc denotes the density of the coolant, kg/m3, t denotes the time, 
 denotes the velocity vector of the coolant, cc denotes the specific heat capacity of the coolant, J/(kg·K), Tc denotes the temperature of the coolant, K, λc denotes the thermal conductivity of the coolant, W/(m·K), P denotes the static pressure of the coolant, and μc denotes the dynamic viscosity of the coolant, Pa·s.
Based on the Reynolds number, Re value to evaluate the flow state of the coolant, as shown in Eq. (10) ∼ (11):
(10)
(11)
Where, Af is the inlet cross-sectional area, m2, qc is the coolant mass flow rate, kg/s, Dh is the hydraulic diameter, m, Af,w is the wet surface area, m2, and Vc is the coolant volume, m3.
The assumptions about the two-dimensional topological domain are as follows.
(1)
The working fluid is an incompressible medium, and the physical parameters such as density and dynamic viscosity remain constant.
(2)
Re in the liquid channel is below 2300, which is laminar flow.
(3)
The fluid shows isotropic distribution characteristics in the flow channel, and there is no obvious axial or radial gradient change.
(4)
Assume that the influence of gravity is neglected.
(5)
Adiabatic and non-slip boundary conditions are set around the design region of the liquid channel.
In this study, a synergistic thermal management system with topological channels and phase change materials (PCM) is used. For PCM, the solid-liquid phase change process obeys the laws of mass conservation, momentum conservation, and energy conservation. In order to reduce the complexity of the numerical simulation, the following assumptions are made for the simulation of PCM.
(1)
The physical properties of each phase of PCM are constant.
(2)
The PCM is an incompressible Newtonian fluid in the liquid phase.
(3)
The volume change induced by the phase change process can be neglected.
(4)
The internal material of the phase change materials is homogeneous and the thermal conductivity is the same in all 3 directions.
(5)
The contact thermal resistance is not considered.
The energy equation of PCM can be expressed as Eq. (12):
(12)
Where, ρpcm is the density of PCM, λpcm is the thermal conductivity of PCM,W/(m·K), Hpcm is phase change enthalpy, J.
(13)
(14)
Where, hpcm is sensible enthalpy at the reference temperature(Tref), ΔH is the latent heat between 0 and L, cpcm is the specific heat capacity of PCM at constant pressure, J/(kg·k), β is the liquid phase rate, %, γ0 is the latent heat of phase transition, J/kg, Ts is the solid temperature at which phase change begins, and Tl is the liquid temperature at which phase change ends.
2.2.3. Grid independence verification
In this study, we simulate the actual scenario of electric mining trucks, choose 3 C discharge rate, and test under 30 °C environment. The aggregate battery model is used to consider the increase in heat generation due to chemical reaction and internal resistance in charging and discharging. Since the maximum Reynolds number of the flow channel is less than 2300, the laminar flow model is used. The coolant flow rate was set at 0.02 kg/s, the inlet temperature was 30 °C, and the model was simplified with the no-slip boundary condition, and the mass fraction of CPCM was 10 %. The battery transfers heat by heat conduction, and the coolant and the channel wall, the shell and the outside air rely on convection heat transfer, ignoring radiative heat transfer. The outer wall of the battery pack uses natural convection with a convection heat transfer coefficient of 5 W/(m2·K). Contact thermal resistance is neglected, and the initial temperature of each component is set to the ambient temperature of 30 °C.
The meshing was performed using the meshing module of COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2. The number of grids will have an impact on the computational accuracy of the simulation, and the density of the grids will also affect the simulation results. In general, the finer the mesh, the smaller the discretization error. In the overall battery pack grid model constructed, the electrodes are meshed with hexahedral grids, and the cell body, liquid channels and phase change materials are divided by a tetrahedral grid, with a minimum grid quality of 6.48 × 10−4 and an average grid quality of 0.6892, which meets the simulation requirements. The structure that has less influence on the simulation analysis of the battery pack is ignored to simplify the model. The grid model of the battery thermal management system is shown in Fig. 6.

In this simulation, the maximum battery temperature and the maximum temperature difference at the end of battery discharge are analyzed as the key indices to verify the simulation results. In the simulation, five different grid numbers are selected for the analysis, which are 356482, 985468, 2856545, 4953758, and 6821456, respectively. Fig. 7 is the grid-independence analysis of the thermal management system of the battery with different grid numbers. As shown in Fig. 7, when the number of grids increases from 2856545 to 4953758, the maximum temperature difference change only by 0.005 °C and 0.015 °C, and then tend to a stable state, and the trend of the relative error change is maintained within the range of 1 %. It is concluded that the change of the number of grids has a minimal effect on the simulation results, and 4,953,758 grids are finally selected as the number of grids for subsequent calculations under the comprehensive consideration of the simulation efficiency and computational accuracy, while guaranteeing the simulation results. When setting the time step, a time step of 1 s is used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results.

In this section, the mining driving conditions for this study are obtained from actual mine road spectrum data collection, and can reliably represent the driving conditions of a specific open-pit mine, which located in Ejin Horo Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The working conditions are as follows: electric mining trucks work in open-pit mines, collaborating with excavators or loaders to transport ores from surface mines. They continuously drive uphill under load to deliver and unload goods at designated locations, followed by continuous downhill driving under no load to return to the mine. During this process, the maximum climbing gradient when driving uphill under load can reach 11.23 %, and the maximum elevation difference when driving downhill under no load can reach 185 m.

2.3.2. Simulation and analysis of dynamics of electric mining truck
According to the speed changes of mining conditions and CHTC-D condition, they are inputted into AVL-Cruise for dynamics simulation, so as to visualize the driving scenarios of electric mining trucks under the three conditions, and the changes in acceleration can indirectly reflect the battery pack current output. The simulation results of electric mining trucks in terms of dynamics are shown in Fig. 11, which demonstrates the changes of vehicle speed, distance and acceleration under full-load and no-load conditions. In Fig. 11(a), under full-load condition, the distance shows an approximate linear increase with time, indicating that the electric mining trucks as a whole are continuously traveling forward with increasing distance. A total of 5000 m was traveled, during which the acceleration corresponded to the speed of the electric mining trucks, and the speed had a slow increase phase around 0–200 s, followed by a rapid increase in the speed around 200–400 s, with positive acceleration. In 400–500 s, the vehicle speed fluctuates greatly, and the acceleration fluctuation range is also large, with the maximum acceleration of 0.49 m/s2. Between 500–900 s, the vehicle speed basically stays at a relatively stable state of about 20 km/h, and the acceleration is maintained at 0 m/s2 at this time, and the speed fluctuates a little bit again after 900 s, with the acceleration in negative value, and the lowest value is −0.38 m/s2, and the vehicle speed decreases. After 900 s, the speed fluctuates again, and the acceleration is negative, down to −0.38 m/s2, and the speed drops. Finally, it stops at the designated position unloading area to brake for unloading. In Fig. 11(b), it is still a 5000 m traveling drive under full-load condition. In each period of time, 0–200 s: the vehicle speed gradually rises from low, the acceleration is basically positive, and there are some fluctuations, indicating that the vehicle is in the acceleration state in this stage, although it is not a smooth acceleration. It rises to a maximum speed of 29.73 km/h 200–400 s: the vehicle speed rises and fluctuates frequently. 400–800 s: the rising trend of the vehicle speed slows down, and the acceleration fluctuates up and down near 0 m/s2, which indicates that the vehicle gradually enters into a state of constant speed, at about 29.73 km/h 800–900 s: the vehicle speed begins to fall again, and the acceleration becomes negative again. 900–1200 s: the vehicle has frequent switching of acceleration and deceleration at this stage, the driving state is not fixed, and the driving mileage is finally completed.

The simulation results of the vehicle power performance under CHTC-D driving condition are shown in Fig. 12. The speed oscillates violently in the 0–40 km/h range in the first 800 s, frequently falling to near-zero values, corresponding to the idling and stopping of mining trucks under heavy loading and unloading or complex road conditions, accompanied by a continuous medium-low speed crawling, and the speed is maintained at 20–30 km/h, reflecting the intermittent traveling of the transportation process; and the speed climbs rapidly to the peak of 60 km/h and remains relatively stable at the 1000 s mark in the high-speed return section after 800 s. The speed only briefly drops and adjusts at the 1000 s mark. After 800 s, the speed climbs to a peak of 60 km/h and remains relatively stable, with only a brief speed reduction at 1000 s. The acceleration curve is highly correlated with the speed change. The acceleration curve is highly linked to the speed change, with steep spikes of ±2 m/s2 occurring intensively in the low-speed interval, revealing the transient load impact of the power system in this period; while the acceleration fluctuations in the high-speed interval converge significantly, confirming the smoothness of the working condition.

2.3.3. Electric mining trucks battery pack output current characteristics
The changes in vehicle speed and acceleration revealed by the drivability analysis are ultimately translated into the current output characteristics of the battery, which is the core driver of battery heat production. Based on the drivability data in 3.2, this section further deduces the output current range, peak value, and SOC changes of the battery under different working conditions, clarifies the load difference of the battery under full-load, no load, and CHTC-D working condition, and provides the key parameters for heat generation calculation for the subsequent thermal performance analysis.
The internal battery pack current variation is explored through the output current characteristic curve in Fig. 13 to understand the battery pack output current under different working conditions. Fig. 13(a) shows that the battery pack current fluctuates between −500 and 1000 An under full-load condition, with a significant peak of up to 2162.56 A at 400–500 s due to braking and acceleration. The initial SOC of the battery pack is 75 %, which gradually decreases during the process, with a small increase at 400-1100 s due to energy recovery, and the SOC decreases to 71.31 % at the end of the discharge, which consumes about 3.69 %. In Fig. 13(b), the acceleration in the first 200 s of the no-load condition makes the current fluctuate significantly, up to 1341.3 A, and the overall output range of −1000∼1500 A is lower than that of the full-load; the initial SOC is 71.31 %, and it finally rises to 74.66 % due to the energy braking and recovery, which recovers about 3.35 %. Taken together, the process of going uphill with full-load and going downhill with no load consumes only 0.34 % of SOC, indicating that the high efficiency of battery energy recovery when going downhill with no-load can reasonably control the power consumption as well as help to improve the vehicle range and energy utilization efficiency.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermal performance analysis of battery packs for electric mining trucks under different working conditions
Based on the current output characteristics in Section 2.3.3, which are transformed into the battery pack heat generation, the heat generation under both no-load and full-load conditions is shown in Fig. 15, and the heat generation of the battery pack under the CHTC-D condition is shown in Fig. 16. The study will focus on the accumulation of heat in the battery pack and the effectiveness of the thermal management system in controlling the temperature of the battery pack, choosing Tmax and ΔTmax as the evaluation indices to analyze the temperature rise characteristics of the battery pack.

Fig. 16. Heat generation: CHTC-D condition.

The heat generation of the three conditions is input into the COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 software simulation, and the ambient temperature(Tam) and the initial temperature of the battery pack are set to 30 °C, so as to obtain the curves of Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack under the mine driving conditions (Fig. 17) and the CHTC-D condition (Fig. 18). The full-load condition is shown in Fig. 17(a), where the battery pack Tmax soars from the initial 30 °C all the way to 70.32 °C. This temperature rise is attributed to the fact that during full-load hill climbing, the vehicle is required to overcome substantial driving resistance. The sustained high-power output of the drive system compelled the battery pack to operate under high-rate discharge conditions, with the current fluctuating between −500 A and 1000 A. This high-rate discharge scenario resulted in a significant acceleration of electrochemical reaction rates and a notable increase in Joule heating generation. During the 0–200 s phase, heat generation remained minimal, leading to a gradual elevation of Tmax. In the 400–600 s interval, however, heat production surged sharply, which coincided with the occurrence of current peaks; this phenomenon caused Tmax to rapidly rise to 54.1 °C. Meanwhile, the ΔTmax reached 4.78 °C at 492 s. This observation can be explained by the localized heat generation rate exceeding the internal thermal conduction rate, which aggravated the deficiency in z-axis thermal conduction and consequently induced an uneven temperature distribution within the battery pack. At the conclusion of the discharge process, Tmax and ΔTmax were recorded as 70.32 °C and 5.63 °C, respectively, displaying highly consistent variation trends. These results confirm the coupled relationship between heat generation intensity and the temperature response of the battery pack. The no-load condition is shown in Fig. 17(b), the Tmax of the battery pack increased to 67.01 °C within 1200 s, exhibiting an average temperature rise rate of 0.031 °C/s. During the initial phase (0–400 s), the heat generation rate remained approximately 3.5 × 104 W/m2, which led to a rapid increase in Tmax to 47.08 °C, while the ΔTmax fluctuated around 3 °C. Despite the absence of heavy load application at this stage, the battery entered an intermittent charging state during downhill energy recovery, with current peaks reaching 1341.3 A. Localized temperature fluctuations persisted, which can be attributed to the polarization heat generated during charging. From 400 to 600 s, the temperature rise rate stabilized. Near 600 s, fluctuations in the heat generation rate triggered a sudden surge in Tmax, within 50 s, the temperature rise rate reached 0.055 °C/s, and ΔTmax eventually reached 5.13 °C. The variation trend of ΔTmax was consistent with that of Tmax, indicating that under no-load conditions, the thermal behavior of the battery pack is still dominated by locally uneven heat generation induced by dynamic currents.

Fig. 18. The Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack under CHTC-D condition.

As illustrated in Fig. 18 for the CHTC-D test cycle, the thermal behavior of the battery pack presents distinct phase-specific characteristics: within the initial 800 s, the heat generation rate remains extremely low and consistently hovers near zero. This phase corresponds to the vehicle operating in frequent idling and low-speed crawling modes, with a stable current output; under such conditions, electrochemical reactions and Joule heating are negligible, enabling the battery pack temperature to remain largely stable at its initial value. After 800 s, the operating conditions shifted abruptly as the vehicle entered the high-speed return phase, where the current peaked at 922.57 A. Sustained discharge led to cumulative heat generation, driving the Tmax to rise rapidly from 30 °C to 45.81 °C, while the ΔTmax simultaneously increased to 3.23 °C. Although the heat generation intensity during this process was lower than that under mining conditions, the sudden surge in current temporarily disrupted the thermal equilibrium of the battery pack. Nevertheless, due to the lack of prolonged high-rate discharge, the accumulated heat remained limited, and the temperature difference did not exceed the safety threshold.
A comparison of the temperature characteristics of battery packs under different operating conditions reveals the following: In mining scenarios, the battery pack undergoes prolonged high-rate discharge, resulting in sustained heat accumulation that drives its temperature well beyond the optimal operating range of 20–45 °C, with the internal temperature difference exceeding 5 °C (the safety threshold). Specifically, after a 1200 s full-load discharge cycle, the Tmax and ΔTmax were 4.94 % and 9.74 % higher than those under no-load conditions, respectively, and 53.54 % and 74.31 % higher than those under the CHTC-D test cycle conditions. This phenomenon arises because under full-load operation, the peak current is higher and the duration of sustained high current is longer, which enhances the combined effects of Joule heating and reaction heat. Meanwhile, the limited z-axis thermal conduction further aggravates the temperature difference within the battery pack. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures and significant temperature gradients accelerates the degradation of electrode materials and the decomposition of electrolytes, thereby drastically shortening the battery lifespan. Consequently, an efficient thermal management system is urgently needed to realize precise temperature control of the battery pack.
3.2. Influence of ambient temperature on the thermal performance of battery packs of electric mining trucks under mining conditions
The temperature inconsistency within the battery pack is exacerbated by the temperature difference between day and night, which leads to the negative impacts of battery pack performance degradation, shortened life and increased safety risks. In this study, the mine driving conditions are selected from an open-pit mine in Yijinholo Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is located in the inland area with arid and low rainfall. Due to the influence of the local climatic conditions, there is a significant difference between day and night temperatures in the mining environment, and the difference between day and night temperatures can reach up to 15 °C in the summer. Therefore, in this subsection, 40 °C and 25 °C are selected to simulate the local daytime and nighttime temperatures, and the thermal performance of the battery is investigated under full-load and no-load condition under this daytime and nighttime temperature difference.
The effects of different ambient temperatures on the thermal performance of the battery pack under full-load condition is shown in Fig. 19(a). At 40 °C ambient temperature, the initial temperature of the battery pack is higher, superimposed on the large amount of heat generated by the high rate of discharge at full-load, the rate of increase of Tmax is significantly faster than that of 25 °C environment. From the curve change, in 40 °C environment, Tmax reaches 81.31 °C at 1200 s, which is 16.03 °C higher than that of 65.28 °C in 25 °C environment; ΔTmax ends up 5.76 °C in 40 °C environment, which exceeds that of 3.22 °C in 25 °C environment by about 1.1 °C. This is because the high-temperature environment weakens the heat dissipation efficiency of the battery pack to the outside world, resulting in faster heat accumulation and more uneven internal temperature distribution. Especially in the peak heat generation phase of 400–600 s, the ΔTmax in 40 °C environment instantly climbs to 4.47 °C, while it is only 2.52 °C in 25 °C environment, indicating that the high-temperature environment significantly exacerbates the thermal inhomogeneity of the battery pack. Fig. 19(b) presents the difference in the influence of ambient temperature under no-load condition. Compared with the full-load condition, the heat generation intensity of the battery pack is lower in the no-load condition, but the influence of ambient temperature is still significant: the Tmax in 40 °C environment reaches 75.81 °C in 1200 s, which is 11.99 °C higher than that of 63.82 °C in 25 °C environment; the ΔTmax in 40 °C environment is 4.99 °C, and in 25 °C environment it is 3.06 °C, which do not exceed the 5 °C safety threshold, but the gap gradually expands with time. Both of them did not exceed the safety threshold of 5 °C, but the gap gradually expanded with time. Analyzing the curves, we can see that the ΔTmax fluctuation is larger in the first 200 s of the higher heat production stage, up to 2.79 °C in 25 °C environment, while the highest is about 1.81 °C in 40 °C environment, which is related to the characteristics of the battery pack that the local heat production is concentrated in the no-load condition but the overall heat is less, and the ambient temperature can change the distribution of the temperature difference indirectly by influencing the heat dissipation rate, and the influence is weaker than that of full-load condition.

Fig. 19. The Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack under different ambient temperatures: (a) Full-load. (b) No-load.

As shown in Fig. 20, the thermal performance curves under the CHTC-D condition show a different pattern. Due to the lower overall heat intensity of the battery pack under this condition, the difference of Tmax between 40 °C and 25 °C ambient temperature is small, which is 55.59 °C and 39.72 °C respectively at 1200 s, with a difference of 17.87 °C; ΔTmax is stabilized within 3.5 °C in both ambient temperatures and the trend of change is basically the same. This is because the battery pack in the CHTC-D condition has not experienced a long time of high-rate discharge, the total amount of heat production is limited, and the influence of ambient temperature on heat dissipation is weakened, so that the temperature distribution is less affected by the impact of environmental fluctuations.

Comparing the three conditions, it can be seen that the degree of influence of ambient temperature on the thermal performance of the battery is positively correlated with the intensity of heat production in the working conditions, and the high-temperature environment under the full-load condition in the mine poses the most prominent threat to the thermal safety of the battery, which highlights the necessity of targeted thermal management.
3.3. Thermal performance analysis of TLCP-BTMS under mining conditions
Synthesizing the temperature rise characteristics of electric mining trucks' batteries under mining conditions with the impact of day-night temperature difference in mines, this section utilizes the battery thermal management system with topological channels and phase change materials designed in the previous section to explore the thermal management performance of the BTMS under special mining conditions, in order to break through the bottleneck of thermal management in mines. According to the previous analysis, the Tmax and ΔTmax of the three working conditions are higher than 25 °C when the ambient temperature is at 40 °C, so the initial temperature of the environment and the battery are set to 40 °C, the discharge time under three working conditions is 1200 s. Meanwhile, the mass flow rate of the coolant at the inlet of the channel is 0.02 kg/s, the temperature is 35 °C and the mass fraction of the CPCM is 10 %.
As illustrated in Fig. 21(a) under full-load conditions, battery packs with and without the TLCP-BTMS show distinct thermal performance differences: without cooling, battery-generated heat accumulates continuously, resulting in a Tmax of 81.31 °C and a ΔTmax of 5.76 °C at 1200 s—both exceeding safety thresholds. When the TLCP-BTMS is activated, the Tmax at discharge completion was only 46.06 °C, and ΔTmax decreased to 4.85 °C, remaining within the 5 °C safety margin. This improvement stemed from the CPCM's phase change latent heat, which instantly absorbs much of the heat from full-load high-rate discharge to suppress localized temperature spikes. Optimized topology channels enhance coolant distribution, reducing flow resistance while increasing heat exchange area and convective heat dissipation efficiency for rapid residual heat removal. As illustrated in Fig. 21(b) under no-load conditions, thermal performance comparisons showed that without cooling, the battery pack reached a Tmax of 75.8 °C and a ΔTmax of 4.99 °C, with the TLCP-BTMS enabled, Tmax decreased to 44.88 °C, while ΔTmax stabilized at 4.36 °C over the 1200 s discharge cycle. Under this condition, though the battery avoided sustained high loads, intermittent heat generation still induced localized temperature fluctuations. The CPCM in the TLCP-BTMS buffered these transient thermal shocks, while liquid cooling channels continuously dissipated accumulated heat to prevent thermal imbalance—this process confirmed the BTMS's adaptability to the “full-load-idle alternation” demands of mining environments, enabling efficient temperature control across varying loads without additional adjustments.

Fig. 21. The Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack under mining conditions with and without BTMS: (a) Full-load (b) No-load.

As illustrated in Fig. 22 under the CHTC-D operating condition, the TLCP-BTMS exhibited equally notable temperature control performance: without cooling, the battery pack reached a Tmax of 55.59 °C and a ΔTmax of 3.23 °C. When the thermal management system was activated, Tmax stabilized at approximately 40 °C; although ΔTmax increased slightly, it remained ≤3.1 °C. Under CHTC-D conditions, the battery's heat generation intensity was relatively low, and the latent heat of the CPCM was sufficient to address most transient heat generation, requiring the liquid-cooled channels to maintain only low-power heat dissipation. The system adopted a collaborative control mode with passive phase change temperature control as the main approach and active liquid cooling as auxiliary heat dissipation, which ensured efficient temperature control while reducing energy consumption. This result verified the TLCP-BTMS's adaptive adjustment capability under conditions of different heat generation intensities, enabling it to be fully adaptable to the complex and variable driving scenarios in mining operations.

To validate the superior performance of the designed TLCP-BTMS, two control groups (single liquid cooling, TLC and single composite phase change cooling, CPCM) were set up, the TLC group had the peripherally wrapped phase change material removed, while the CPCM group replaced the topological channel liquid cooling plate with phase change material. The test was conducted under full-load conditions at 40 °C ambient temperature, with the cooling fluid mass flow rate and temperature of the TLC group matched to those of the TLCP-BTMS, and the battery pack's temperature rise characteristics are presented in Fig. 23 Compared with the two single cooling modes, the TLCP-BTMS demonstrated distinct advantages in battery pack temperature control: the Tmax was 20.96 % lower than the TLC group and 36.12 % lower than the CPCM group, while the ΔTmax was controlled at 4.85 °C. Although this value was slightly higher than those of the TLC and CPCM groups, it featured a narrower temperature difference fluctuation range and higher stability, with the overall temperature difference still maintained within 5 °C to ensure battery pack temperature uniformity. This advantage originated from the TLCP-BTMS's synergistic regulation mechanism, the CPCM absorbed transient heat via latent heat to suppress local temperature spikes, while the topologically optimized liquid cooling channels efficiently dissipated accumulated heat by enhancing convective heat transfer, concurrently addressing the application limitations of pure TLC and pure CPCM. These results confirmed that the TLCP-BTMS possessed excellent thermal control capabilities in extreme mining environments. In addition, the increased mass of the entire vehicle equipped with TLCP-BTMS has no significant impact on the power performance during driving compared with 30,000 kg when the electric mining truck is unloaded and 90,000 kg when it is fully loaded. At the same time, the topology-optimized cold plate structure can reduce flow resistance and reduce additional pump power consumption. From the perspective of the whole life cycle, the negative impact of pump power loss can be completely covered by thermal management benefits.

4. Conclusion
To address the thermal safety challenges of lithium-ion battery packs in electric mining trucks under harsh mining conditions—including high loads and a 15 °C diurnal temperature variation—this study developed an innovative Topology-optimized Liquid-Cooling and Composite Phase Change Material Battery Thermal Management System, hereinafter referred to as TLCP-BTMS. This system integrates topology-optimized liquid-cooling channels and composite phase change materials doped with 10 % mass fraction of expanded graphite. Key findings and contributions are summarized as follows.
(1)
AVL-Cruise software was employed to simulate the battery output current characteristics under three typical operating conditions: full-load, no-load, and the CHTC-D cycle. The maximum output currents of the battery pack under full-load, no-load, and the CHTC-D cycle were determined as 2162.56 A, 1341.3 A, and 922.57 A respectively, providing accurate heat generation input for subsequent thermal analysis.
(2)
Thermal simulations revealed critical thermal risks without cooling. Under 40 °C ambient temperature and full-load, the battery pack's Tmax reached 81.31 °C and its ΔTmax reached 5.76 °C, both exceeding the safe operation thresholds of Tmax ≤ 60 °C and ΔTmax ≤ 5 °C. Even under no load and the CHTC-D cycle, Tmax values remained at 75.81 °C and 55.59 °C respectively, which were still above the optimal temperature range of 20–45 °C, highlighting the urgency of effective thermal management.
(3)
The TLCP-BTMS demonstrated excellent thermal regulation performance. Under 40 °C full-load, activating the system reduced Tmax by 43.35 %–46.06 °C and ΔTmax to 4.85 °C, which falls within the 5 °C safety limit. For no-load conditions, Tmax decreased by 40.79 %–44.88 °C with ΔTmax stabilized at 4.36 °C. Under the CHTC-D cycle, the system maintained Tmax at approximately 40 °C and ΔTmax ≤ 3.1 °C, ensuring the battery operated within the optimal temperature range across all scenarios.
(4)
Comparative tests with single cooling strategies—TLC alone and CPCM alone—confirmed the superiority of the proposed synergistic design. Under 40 °C full-load, TLCP-BTMS reduced Tmax by 20.96 % compared to TLC and 36.12 % compared to CPCM, while maintaining ΔTmax stability kept within 5 °C. This validates that the integration of the efficient heat dissipation of TLC and the transient heat buffering of CPCM addresses the limitations of single cooling methods, offering a viable solution for battery thermal management in electric mining trucks.
Notably, this study relies on numerical simulations; future work will focus on experimental validation of the TLCP-BTMS and incorporation of battery aging effects to further enhance the system's practical applicability.
