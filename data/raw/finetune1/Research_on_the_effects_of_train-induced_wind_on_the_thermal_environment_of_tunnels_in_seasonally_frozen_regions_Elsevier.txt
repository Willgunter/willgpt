Abstract
With the increasing operating speed of high-speed trains, the aerodynamic flow induced by trains during tunnel traversal exerts a growing impact on the thermal environment of cold-region tunnels. Based on the temperature monitoring data from the Wafangdian Tunnel, this study defines two thermal conditions: the positive-effect condition (P-Condition) and the negative-effect condition (N-Condition). Utilizing the validated numerical model, this study first analyzed the effect of train-induced wind on the tunnel thermal environment under the two conditions, then systematically investigated the regulatory roles of blocking ratio (B), train speed (v), and train length (L). The results indicate that under the N-Condition, the train-induced wind serves as a “cold pump,” which significantly enhances heat dissipation. This leads to a net heat loss of 85.22 × 103 kJ, thus impairing the tunnel's thermal insulation. Conversely, under the P-Condition, the wind operates as a “heat source,” generating a cumulative net heat gain of 168.47 × 103 kJ (equivalent to the heat from 20.12 kg of raw coal combustion, calorific value 8374 kJ/kg) and thereby benefiting the anti-freezing capacity. Furthermore, factors B, v, and L significantly regulate the tunnel thermal environment. Under N-Condition, higher values of these factors intensify heat dissipation, which is unfavorable for maintaining anti-freezing performance. Conversely, under P-Condition, increased levels promote heat accumulation within the tunnel, thereby enhancing freeze resistance. Based on this, during the operation, it is recommended to prioritize the monitoring of dynamic changes in the thermal condition, and further optimize the tunnel's anti-freezing performance by reasonably adjusting train operation parameters.

1. Introduction
The high-speed railway network continues to expand to seasonal frozen regions, making the problem of tunnel freezing increasingly prominent (Sun et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2021). Under low-temperature conditions, tunnels are prone to a range of typical frost-related issues, including lining icing, trackbed frost heave, and drainage system freeze-blocking. These problems not only seriously threaten operational safety but also significantly increase maintenance costs (Zhao et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020b). The distribution and evolution of the tunnel temperature field are core factors influencing the occurrence of freezing damage, affected by multiple elements including mechanical ventilation, natural wind, and train-induced wind (Yang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2016). Among these, the train-induced wind generated by high-speed trains acts as a strong aerodynamic disturbance, playing a decisive role in shaping the dynamic thermal environment inside tunnels (Wang et al., 2022).
Extensive research has examined the impact of train-induced wind on the thermal environment of cold-region tunnels (Jiang et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2022b; Yang et al., 2023). For instance, Zhou et al. (2025) developed a coupled airflow-temperature model using dynamic mesh technology and an “equivalent wind speed” approach to investigate the effects of train frequency, surrounding rock temperature, external temperature, and wind speed on the temperature field in single-track high-speed railway tunnels. Through a combination of on-site monitoring and numerical simulations, Hou et al. (2025) revealed the temperature distribution and severity of frost damage resulting from the train piston effect. Separately, Tao et al. (2022a) utilized both model and field tests to analyze how natural wind speed, natural wind temperature, train speed, and traffic volume influence the anti-freezing length of tunnels. Ma et al. (2025) elucidated the underlying mechanism and pattern of train-induced wind's influence on the tunnel temperature field by analyzing air pressure distribution and airflow characteristics during train passage. Similarly, adopting dynamic mesh technology, Wei et al. (2023) concluded that high-speed trains introduce substantial cold air into tunnels, thereby lowering the internal air temperature and intensifying convective heat exchange with the tunnel structures.
Although the existing research has explored the influence of train-induced wind on the thermal environment of tunnels in cold regions, the core shortcoming is that the difference of thermal conditions is ignored. In real-world scenarios, significant differences exist between the external air temperature and the internal tunnel temperature: during deep winter or at night, cold external air is drawn deep into the tunnel by train-induced wind, intensifying convective heat transfer with the lining and track structure. This leads to a sharp temperature drop near the tunnel entrance, disrupts the thermal balance, and exacerbates the risk of freezing damage (Gao et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2021). This leads to a sharp temperature drop near the tunnel entrance, disrupts the thermal balance, and exacerbates the risk of freezing damage (Fan et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025). In contrast, during transitional seasons or daytime periods when the external ambient temperature is relatively higher than the internal tunnel temperature, the effect of train-induced wind is reversed. Under such conditions, the train-induced wind transports relatively warm external air into the tunnel, effectively increasing the heat input. This differential impact has not been adequately addressed in existing research, resulting in a lack of targeted support for the design of anti-freezing measures and operational strategies in cold-region tunnels.
Therefore, this paper took the Wafangdian Tunnel as the research object, established a numerical model that can accurately reflect the train-induced wind effect, and systematically revealed the spatial and temporal evolution of the temperature field of the tunnel in the cold region under the action of train-induced wind under different thermal conditions. Finally, it provided scientific basis and practical guidance for formulating more accurate thermal environment control schemes, optimizing anti-freezing and heat preservation measures, and reducing the risk of freezing damage for tunnels in cold regions.
2. Monitoring and analysis of air temperature
2.1. Monitoring scheme
Wafangdian Tunnel is located in Lingyuan City, Liaoning Province, China, at coordinates 39.7°N latitude and 121.8°E longitude. It is a single-tunnel double-track high-speed railway tunnel situated in a seasonal frost area, defined as a region where the temperature cyclically fluctuates above and below 0 °C. Due to this climatic characteristic, the external temperature fluctuates above and below freezing throughout the year, posing a risk of frost damage to the tunnel structure. More than 50 trains pass through the tunnel in a day. The primary design and geometric parameters are as follows: track gauge of 5.0 m, designed operating speed of 350 km/h. The tunnel extends from DK292 + 050 (entrance) to DK292 + 645 (exit), with a total length of 595 m and a maximum overburden thickness of approximately 85.8 m. The precise location of the tunnel is indicated in Fig. 1. According to the local meteorological records, the average annual temperature of the tunnel is about 8.7 °C, and the average temperature of the coldest month is about −10.0 °C. In accordance with the provisions of Code for Design of Railway Tunnels (TB 10003 - 2016), the tunnel belongs to the severe cold tunnel.

The external ambient temperature was monitored by the PC-4 weather station near the tunnel portal to accurately represent the external thermal conditions. The air temperature inside the tunnel was monitored using RC-5 temperature recorders. These recorders were installed on the tunnel side walls, with their vertical height set to 1 m from the top surface of the inner rail. A total of 8 key monitoring sections were arranged in this monitoring, with specific mileage as follows: DK292 + 060, DK292 + 120, DK292 + 200, DK292 + 450, DK292 + 520, DK292 + 570, DK292 + 600, and DK292 + 620. These cross-sections evenly cover the tunnel's entrance section, middle section, and exit section, enabling a comprehensive reflection of the longitudinal temperature distribution law of the tunnel.
2.2. Analysis of monitoring results
The variation in external air temperature is depicted in Fig. 3. Overall, the temperature fluctuation resembled a trigonometric function, ranging from a maximum of 28.81 °C to a minimum of −22.03 °C. Sub-zero temperatures predominantly occurred from November to February, with a four-month average of −4.65 °C. January was the coldest month, exhibiting a mean temperature of −9.82 °C.

Fig. 4 shows the air temperatures at the monitoring cross-sections inside the Wafangdian Tunnel. The internal temperature exhibited a variation trend consistent with the external temperature, resembling a trigonometric function. The temperature differences between cross-sections were minor, with a narrow average variation range of 2.03 °C, owing to the short tunnel length.

Fig. 4. Air temperature curve inside the tunnel.

The longitudinal air temperature distribution inside the tunnel is presented in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the air temperature along the tunnel exhibits a “lower at both ends and higher in the middle” pattern, with the temperature curve being approximately symmetric about the middle of the tunnel. Specifically, the longitudinal temperature gradient is nearly zero in the tunnel's middle section, whereas more significant temperature gradients are observed near the tunnel portals. Taking February 9, 2016, as a representative example: the longitudinal temperature gradient within 150 m from the tunnel portal reached 0.012 °C/m, and the air temperature at the location 20 m from the portal was −3.01 °C.

Fig. 5. Longitudinal temperature curves of Wafangdian Tunnel.

Fig. 6 (a) presents the dynamic comparison results of the inside and outside air temperatures in the Wafangdian Tunnel from January to February 2016. As observed from the figure, driven by the combined effects of external environmental factors—including the diurnal variation of solar radiation intensity and the periodic adjustment of atmospheric circulation—the external air temperature exhibits more significant fluctuations and oscillatory characteristics. In contrast, due to the tunnel's relatively enclosed spatial structure and weaker interference from external meteorological conditions, the internal air temperature remains within a relatively stable range, with a fluctuation amplitude notably lower than that of the external air temperature. This distinct difference in temperature stability between the tunnel interior and exterior further gives rise to two typical thermal conditions: the first is defined as N-Condition, where the external air temperature is lower than the internal air temperature; the second is defined as P-Condition, where the external air temperature is higher than the internal air temperature. According to Fig. 6 (b) The occurrence of N-Condition and P-Condition accounted for 67.21 % and 32.79 %, respectively, indicating that both thermal conditions cannot be ignored.

Notably, the mechanism of train-induced wind on the tunnel temperature field is closely related to the direction of the internal-external temperature difference. Under these two distinct thermal conditions, the regulatory effect of train-induced wind is different. Therefore, studying its impact under varying thermal conditions is of considerable engineering value for optimizing frost protection design in cold-region tunnels.
3. Establishment and verification of numerical model
In this study, a full-scale numerical simulation model was established based on the Wafangdian Tunnel. The model is mainly composed of air area, train running area and high-speed train. The specific geometric dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 7. The high-speed train model is based on the CRH380 B EMU. The train is grouped into 8 carriages. The length of each carriage is about 25 m (l), the width is about 3.3 m (d), and the height is about 3.9 m (h). In order to simplify the calculation and retain the key aerodynamic characteristics, complex components such as wheels and pantographs can be omitted (Deng et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2025). This study focuses on the influence of train-induced wind on the temperature field inside a tunnel.

Fig. 7. Numerical model diagram.

Since the high-speed train only takes a few seconds to pass through the tunnel, the total simulation time is 70 s. In such a short period of time, the heat exchange between the surrounding rock and the air in the tunnel is relatively small. Therefore, in this analysis, the influence of surrounding rock temperature is not considered, and the tunnel wall is set as an adiabatic wall. And because the core focus of this study is to systematically study the independent influence of high-speed trains on the temperature field of tunnels in cold regions, the current simulation does not include natural wind.
3.1. Grid division and solution scheme
The structured grids were generated using the Block method in ICEM-CFD. This approach ensures a better fit between the grid and the geometric model, facilitates refined control over local mesh resolution, and improves the efficiency and accuracy of numerical computations (Akdag and Wulf, 1992). The resulting grid is shown in Fig. 8. (See Fig. 9.)

The total number of grid elements in the model is approximately 1.8 million, with an average grid quality of 0.90. The grid system consists of both dynamic and static mesh zones, where the dynamic mesh zone encompasses the train and the surrounding air domain. The separation factor is 0.4 and the collapse factor is 0.2. The User-Defined Functions (UDF) were employed to assign velocity values to the rigid mesh, simulating the dynamic motion of the high-speed train and accurately reproducing its movement inside the tunnel. To ensure computational accuracy, mesh refinement was applied in the train movement area and the tunnel air domain, with a minimum grid size of 0.001 m.
Moreover, the governing equations for fluid flow were solved using a pressure-based solver in Fluent for the transient simulation. Turbulence was modeled with the RNG k-ε model. The train speed is close to Mach 0.3, according to the theory of fluid mechanics, the influence of air compressibility on airflow temperature field cannot be ignored. Therefore, the compressible air model was used in the numerical simulation. The momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, and specific dissipation rate equations were discretized using the Second-Order Upwind scheme. A time step of 0.01 s and a maximum of 50 iterations per step were adopted.
3.2. Numerical model validation
3.2.1. Grid independence verification
The grid independence verification was conducted for the mesh schemes (see Table 2). The results demonstrate excellent consistency among calculations with different grid densities. Specifically, the temperature differences between medium and fine grids at the tunnel entrance, middle section, and exit were merely 0.11 °C, 0.08 °C, and 0.12 °C respectively, indicating negligible numerical deviations. After comprehensive consideration of both computational accuracy and efficiency, the medium-density mesh scheme was ultimately adopted.

Coarse	0.80	−4.85	1.98	0.96
Medium	1.80	−4.97	1.90	1.07
Fine	3.80	−5.08	1.98	1.19
3.2.2. Experimental verification
To verify the effectiveness of the numerical algorithm proposed in this study, the full-scale test of a certain tunnel on the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway (Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020) was reproduced via numerical simulation. Subsequently, the simulation results were compared with the measured data of this full-scale test. During the numerical simulation process, the model parameter configurations of the train and tunnel were strictly consistent with the actual parameters of the full-scale test. This ensures complete consistency of the comparison benchmark between the simulation and the test, thereby accurately verifying the accuracy of the numerical simulation method.
The comparative analysis demonstrates close agreement between the simulated and full-scale test results, with deviations of 4.23 % in the maximum slipstream peak and 7.41 % in the peak-to-peak pressure coefficient—both within acceptable margins. Given the strong coupling between the temperature field and the flow field parameters (pressure and velocity), the high accuracy achieved in reproducing these aerodynamic features supports the reliability of the numerically predicted temperature distributions. Therefore, the temperature results obtained in this study are considered sufficiently accurate for subsequent investigation.
4. Influence of train-induced wind on tunnel temperature field
4.1. Initial temperature field setup
This study selected February 9 as the dedicated research period for investigating the impact of train-induced winds on the tunnel temperature field. Based on monitoring results, the fitting results for the longitudinal temperature field of Wafangdian Tunnel on this day are shown in Eqs. (1), (2), (3):

On this day, the external temperature range was −7.00 °C to 6.50 °C. In the numerical simulation, the external temperature of P-Condition and N-Condition was set to 3 °C and −5 °C respectively.
4.2. Analysis of numerical results
Utilizing the validated numerical model, an analysis was conducted on the train-induced wind effect on the temperature field. The simulation was configured with a train speed (v) of 350 km/h, a blocking ratio (B) of 0.12, and a train length (L) of 200 m (equivalent to 8 carriages). The investigation examined the spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature field, focusing on both its spatial distribution and temporal variation.
4.2.1. Temperature field spatial distribution
In terms of spatial distribution, by comparing the longitudinal temperature contour maps of the tunnel at typical time points (Fig. 10), the disturbance characteristics of the temperature field caused by train-induced winds were visually presented. Simultaneously, the average temperature curves of each cross-section before and after the train passing (Fig. 11) were extracted to quantitatively examine the distribution patterns and thermal changes in the longitudinal temperature field of the tunnel following train operation. Additionally, the tunnel heat variation can be calculated using Eqs. (4), (5), (6), (7).

Fig. 11. The longitudinal temperature curves before and after the train passes through the tunnel: (a) N-Condition and (b) P-Condition.

As shown in Fig. 10,the air temperature response to train-induced wind exhibits distinctly different patterns under the two thermal conditions, which are characterized as follows:
Under the N-Condition (ambient temperature = −5 °C), the tunnel air temperature initially exhibits a stable longitudinal distribution prior to train operation. After 70 s of train movement, the temperature field reorganizes under the influence of the train-induced wind, developing distinct zonal characteristics along the tunnel length: a cooling segment followed by a heating segment from the entrance to the exit. This phenomenon can be attributed to the following mechanisms: on one hand, the negative pressure zone formed at the rear of the train induces the infiltration of external cold air, while the positive pressure at the front of the train pushes the low-temperature air near the entrance, causing a temperature drop in the area near the entrance and forming a cooling segment. On the other hand, the positive pressure at the front of the train pushes the high-temperature air from the middle section of the tunnel toward the exit. When this high-temperature air mixes with the relatively cooler air near the exit section, it results in a temperature increase, forming a heating segment.
Under P-Condition (external temperature = 3 °C), the initial internal temperature of the tunnel is lower than that of the external environment. After 70s of train operation, the induced airflow significantly alters the tunnel temperature field. Near the entrance, the airflow draws in warmer external air, which rapidly exchanges heat with the colder internal air, causing a noticeable temperature rise in this region. Due to the pushing effect of the positive pressure at the train's front, which displaces both the cold air from the entrance and the warm air from the middle section, distinct cooling and heating segments form along the direction of travel. Ultimately, a “heating–cooling–heating” temperature distribution pattern is established from the tunnel entrance to the exit.
In order to realize the quantitative analysis of the cooling segment and the heating segment, the average temperature data of cross-sections at the initial time of the tunnel (0 s) and after the train passes (70s) were extracted and summarized as Fig. 11. The following rules can be clearly observed from the figure:
Under the N-Condition, the tunnel section from 0 to 400 m is designated as the cooling zone after train passage. Within this zone, the temperature in the 0–150 m segment converges to the ambient level. Specifically, at 50 m from the entrance, the cross-sectional temperature drops from −2.41 °C to −5.0 °C, a decrease of 107.47 %. In contrast, the 400–595 m section acts as a heating zone, where the temperature at 450 m from the entrance increases from −1.27 °C to −1.09 °C, representing a rise of 14.17 %.
Under the P-Condition, the temperature distribution exhibits a distinct three-segment pattern after train passage. The section from 0 to 250 m acts as a heating zone, where the temperature at 50 m from the entrance rises from −2.41 °C to 2.96 °C. This is followed by a cooling segment between 250–350 m, in which the temperature at 300 m decreases from −1.21 °C to −1.27 °C, corresponding to a 4.96 % reduction. Finally, the 350–595 m section functions as another heating zone, with the temperature at 450 m increasing from −1.27 °C to −1.10 °C, representing a rise of 13.39 %.
In addition, the tunnel heat variation can be calculated using Eqs. (4), (5), (6), (7). Under N-Condition, the integral value f for the cooling segment (blue area) is −784.46 °C·m, corresponding to a heat loss of 110.80 × 103 kJ. The integral value f for the heating segment (pink area) is 181.01 °C·m, which corresponds to a heat gain of 25.58 × 103 kJ. The net heat loss amounts to 85.22 × 103 kJ. This indicates that under N-Condition, the train-induced wind functions as a “cold pump,” exacerbating heat loss within the tunnel, which is detrimental to thermal insulation in cold-region tunnels.
In contrast, under P-Condition, the total f value for the heating segments reach 1183.22 °C·m (1001.96 °C·m + 181.26 °C·m), equivalent to a heat increase of 169.10 × 103 kJ. The f value for the cooling segment is only −4.49 °C·m, corresponding to a minimal heat loss of 0.63 × 103 kJ. The cumulative net heat increase is 168.47 × 103 kJ. This quantity of heat is equivalent to that generated by burning 5.75 kg of standard coal or 20.12 kg of raw coal (with a calorific value of 8374 kJ/kg). These results demonstrate that under P-Condition, the train-induced wind acts as a “heat source,” significantly enhancing tunnel insulation.
4.2.2. Temperature field temporal variation
To investigate the temporal variation of the tunnel temperature field, temperature data from cross-sections located 50 m, 150 m, 300 m, and 545 m from the tunnel entrance were extracted and are presented in Fig. 12. The results indicate that the temperature curves at all cross-sections exhibit fluctuations, primarily caused by pressure waves generated during train passage.

Fig. 12. Average temperature-time curve of typical cross-section: (a) N-Condition and (b) P-Condition.

Under N-Condition, the temperature trends vary considerably across different cross-sections: temperatures at 50 m, 150 m, and 300 m show a decreasing trend, declining by 1.96 °C, 3.71 °C, and 0.69 °C, respectively. In contrast, the temperature at the 545 m cross-section increases from −2.47 °C to −1.07 °C, representing a rise of 56.68 %.
Under P-Condition, temperatures at the 50 m and 150 m cross-sections exhibit an increasing trend, rising by 5.37 °C and 4.11 °C, respectively. The temperature at the 300 m cross-section shows a slight decrease of only 0.06 °C, with a change rate of 5 %. This behavior can be attributed to the combined effects of train-induced wind: it drives low-temperature air from the entrance section deeper into the tunnel while simultaneously introducing warmer external air into the tunnel. The interaction of these two mechanisms leads to a relatively moderate temperature change at this cross-section. Meanwhile, the temperature at the 545 m cross-section continues to increase, rising from −2.47 °C to −1.10 °C, an increase of 55.47 %.
4.3. Influencing factors of train-induced wind effect
The effects of train-induced wind are significantly correlated with B, v, and L (Cross et al., 2015; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2019). In view of this, conducting systematic research on the above key influencing factors can provide practical technical support for the design optimization of tunnel engineering and the guarantee of operational safety.
Taking the benchmark condition (v = 350 km/h, B = 0.12, L = 200 m) as the reference, this study employed the control variable method to systematically investigate how variations in individual factors affect the temperature distribution. Based on these findings, Eqs. (4), (5), (6), (7) were further applied to accurately quantify the influence of each factor on the thermal changes inside the tunnel.
4.3.1. Blocking ratio
As can be seen from Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, there are significant differences in the influence law of B on tunnel temperature changes under different thermal conditions. The specific analysis is as follows:

As Fig. 13 (a) ~ (c) shows: under N-Condition, with the increase of B, the length of the cooling segment shows an obvious increasing trend, while the length of the heating segment shows a reverse decreasing trend. Specific data show that when B = 0.10, the length of the cooling segment is about 350 m; when B increases to 0.14, the length of the cooling segment extends to about 400 m, which is an increase of 50 m compared with that when B = 0.10, with a growth rate of 14.29 %. At the same time, the length of the heating segment decreases significantly: the length of the heating segment when B = 0.14 is about 195 m less than that when B = 0.10, with a reduction range of 20.41 %.
Moreover, it can be seen from the Fig. 13 (d) that the heat loss in the tunnel's cooling segment shows a gradual increasing trend with the increase of B: when B increases from 0.10 to 0.14, the heat loss in the cooling segment increases from 108.02 × 103 kJ to 113.84 × 103 kJ, with an increase rate of 5.39 %. This phenomenon indicates that a larger B significantly enhances the heat dissipation effect of train-induced wind on the cooling segment. Contrary to the variation trend of the cooling segment, the heat gain in the tunnel's heating segment decreases with the increase of B: taking the case where B increases from 0.10 to 0.14 as an example, the heat gain in the heating segment decreases from 29.45 × 103 kJ to 21.38 × 103 kJ, with a reduction ratio of 27.40 %. This reflects that a larger B weakens the heat accumulation effect in the heating segment. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 13 (e)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat loss under N-Condition, and the total heat loss increases significantly with the increase of B: when B increases from 0.10 to 0.14, the total tunnel heat loss increases from 78.57 × 103 kJ to 92.46 × 103 kJ, with a substantial increase rate of 17.68 %.
As illustrated in Fig. 14 (a) ~ (c), under P-Condition, the influence law of B on the tunnel longitudinal temperature field is completely opposite to that under N-Condition. Specifically, with the increase of B, the length of the heating segments in the tunnel entrance section and exit section increases significantly, while the length of the cooling segment in the middle section decreases accordingly. From the data perspective, when B = 0.10, the total length of the heating segments is about 495 m; when B increases to 0.14, the total length of the heating segments increases to about 595 m, with a growth rate of 20.08 %. It is particularly noteworthy that when B = 0.14, there is no obvious cooling segment, and the entire length of the tunnel shows the characteristic of a heating segment.
Furthermore, an entirely different heat variation law to that under N-Condition can be observed from the data in Fig. 14 (d): when B increases from 0.10 to 0.14, the heat gain in the heating segment increases by 6.36 × 103 kJ, while the heat loss in the cooling segment decreases by 2.08 × 103 kJ. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 14 (e)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat gain under P-Condition, and the total heat gain increases significantly with the increase of B: when the B is 0.10, the total heat gain of the tunnel is 167.33 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 19.98 kg of raw coal (calorific value 8374 kJ/kg); when the B increases to 0.14, the total heat gain reaches 175.97 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 21.01 kg of raw coal. As the B increases from 0.10 to 0.14, the net increase in total tunnel heat gain is 8.64 × 103 kJ, corresponding to an increase in equivalent raw coal mass of approximately 1.03 kg, which reflects the strengthening effect of B on heat accumulation in the tunnel under P-Condition.
In brief, the analysis results show that the B has a significant regulatory effect on the tunnel thermal environment: under N-Condition, a larger B will aggravate the overall heat dissipation inside the tunnel, which is unfavorable for tunnel anti-freezing; however, under P-Condition, a larger B will further promote the overall heat accumulation inside the tunnel, which plays a positive role in tunnel anti-freezing.
4.3.2. Train speed
As can be seen from Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, the v exhibits significant differences in its influence law on the distribution of tunnel longitudinal temperature segments across different thermal conditions. The specific analysis is as follows:

Fig. 16. Temperature and heat variations in tunnel under P-Condition: (a)–(c) Longitudinal temperature profiles before and after train passage at v = 250 km/h, 300 km/h, and 350 km/h, respectively, (d) Heat changes in heating and cooling segments and (e) Total heat change of the tunnel.

Fig. 15 (a) ~ (c) demonstrates that under N-Condition, with the increase of v, the air disturbance effect driven by the high-speed train movement is enhanced, which directly leads to a gradual expansion trend in the length of the cooling segment, while the length of the heating segment shows a contraction trend due to the improved air heat dissipation efficiency. Specific data show that when v = 250 km/h, the length of the cooling segment is about 350 m; when v increases to 350 km/h, the length of the cooling segment extends to about 400 m, which is an increase of about 50 m compared with the low-speed condition (v = 250 km/h), with a growth rate of 14.29 %. At the same time, the length of the heating segment is significantly shortened under the influence of accelerated air heat dissipation: when v = 250 km/h, the length of the heating segment is 245 m; when v = 350 km/h, it shortens to about 195 m, which is a decrease of about 50 m compared with the low-speed condition, with a reduction rate of approximately 20.41 %.
Additionally, Fig. 15 (d) shows that in the cooling segment, the heat loss shows a gradual increasing trend with the increase of train speed: when the v increases from 250 km/h to 350 km/h, the heat loss in the cooling segment rises from 85.57 × 103 kJ to 110.80 × 103 kJ, with an increase rate of 29.48 %. This data indicates that when the train is running at high speed, the heat dissipation effect of the train-induced wind on the cooling segment is significantly enhanced. Contrary to the variation trend of the cooling segment, the heat gain in the tunnel heating segment decreases with the increase of train speed: taking the case where the v increases from 250 km/h to 350 km/h as an example, the heat gain in the heating segment decreases from 25.57 × 103 kJ to 21.71 × 103 kJ, with a reduction ratio of 15.10 %, which reflects that the heat accumulation effect in the heating segment is obviously weakened under high-speed conditions. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 15 (e)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat loss under N-Condition, and the total heat loss increases significantly with the increase of train speed: when the v increases from 250 km/h to 350 km/h, the total tunnel heat loss grows from 60.00 × 103 kJ to 89.09 × 103 kJ, with a substantial increase rate of 48.48 %.
As presented in Fig. 16 (a) ~ (c), under P-Condition, there is an essential difference in the regulatory logic of v on the tunnel longitudinal temperature field compared with N-Condition. As v increases, the efficiency of heat carrying and transfer by air flow is improved, resulting in a continuous expansion trend in the overall length of the tunnel heating segment, while the length of the cooling segment shows a sharp compression trend due to the enhanced heat accumulation effect. From the perspective of specific parameters: when v = 250 km/h, the total length of the heating segments is about 445 m and the length of the cooling segment is about 150 m; when v increases to 350 km/h, the total length of the heating segments increases to approximately about 545 m, which is an increase of 100 m compared with the low-speed condition, with a growth rate of 22.47 %; in the same period, the length of the cooling segment plummets to about 50 m, which is a decrease of 100 m compared with the low-speed condition, with a reduction rate of up to 66.67 %. The spatial proportion of the cooling segment is greatly squeezed, and the contraction effect is particularly prominent.
Fig. 16 (d) illustrates that under the P-Condition, as the v increases from 250 km/h to 350 km/h, the heat gain in the heating segments rises by 35.16 × 103 kJ, whereas the heat loss in the cooling segment decreases by 2.53 × 103 kJ. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 16 (e)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat gain under P-Condition, and the total heat gain increases significantly with the increase of v: when the v = 250 km/h, the total heat gain of the tunnel is 130.78 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 15.62 kg of raw coal (calorific value 8374 kJ/kg); when the v = 350 km/h, the total heat gain reaches 168.47 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 20.12 kg of raw coal. As the v increases from 250 km/h to 350 km/h, the net increase in total tunnel heat gain is 37.69 × 103 kJ, corresponding to an increase in equivalent raw coal mass of approximately 4.50 kg, which reflects the strengthening effect of v on heat accumulation in the tunnel under P-Condition.
In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that train speed significantly modulates the tunnel thermal environment. Under N-Condition, a higher v exacerbates overall heat dissipation within the tunnel, which is detrimental to anti-freezing efforts. In contrast, under P-Condition, the increased v enhances heat accumulation, thereby positively contributing to tunnel anti-freezing.
4.3.3. Train length
Train length significantly affects airflow conditions within tunnels (Guo et al., 2022). As can be seen from Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, the L is a key parameter affecting the tunnel thermal environment. The specific analysis is as follows:

Fig. 18. Temperature and heat variations in tunnel under P-Condition: (a)–(b) Longitudinal temperature profiles before and after train passage at L = 200 m and 400 m, respectively, (c) Heat changes in heating and cooling segments and (d) Total heat change of the tunnel.

As depicted in Fig. 17 (a) ~ (b), under N-Condition, with the increase of L, the length of the cooling segment shows a continuous increasing trend, while the length of the heating segment shows a significant decreasing trend. Specific data show that when L = 200 m (8 carriages), the length of the tunnel cooling segment is about 375 m; when L increases to about 400 m (16 carriages), the length of the cooling segment extends to about 450 m, which is an increase of 75 m. At the same time, the length of the heating segment shows a reverse contraction: when L = 200 m, the length of the heating segment is 220 m; when L = 400 m, it shortens to 145 m, which is a decrease of 75 m compared with that when L = 200 m, with a reduction rate of approximately 34.09 %.
Besides, it can be observed from Fig. 17 (c) that in the tunnel cooling segment, the heat loss shows a continuous increasing trend with the increase of L: when the L increases from 200 m to 400 m, the heat loss in the cooling segment rises from 110.80 × 103 kJ to 138.08 × 103 kJ, with an increase rate of 24.62 %. This change indicates that a longer train significantly enhances the heat dissipation effect on the cooling segment, which is presumably related to the expanded range of air disturbance caused by the increased L. Contrary to the variation trend of the cooling segment, the heat gain in the tunnel heating segment decreases gradually with the increase of L: when L increases from 200 m to 400 m, the heat gain in the heating segment decreases from 25.57 × 103 kJ to 22.13 × 103 kJ, with a reduction ratio of 13.45 %, reflecting that the heat accumulation effect in the heating segment is obviously compressed under the condition of longer L. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 17 (d)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat loss under N-Condition, and the total heat loss shows a significantly expanding trend with the increase of L: when the L increases from 200 m to 400 m, the total tunnel heat loss grows from 85.23 × 103 kJ to 115.95 × 103 kJ, with a substantial increase rate of 36.04 %.
Fig. 18 (a) ~ (b) provides evidence that under P-Condition, there is an essential difference in the influence law of L on the tunnel longitudinal temperature field compared with N-Condition. As L increases, the total length of the tunnel heating segment shows a significant expansion trend, while the length of the cooling segment shows a sharp contraction trend, and eventually even disappears completely. From the perspective of specific parameters: when L = 200 m, the total length of the heating segments is about 495 m and the length of the cooling segment is about 150 m; when L increases to 400 m, the heating segment further expands to the entire tunnel range, the cooling segment disappears completely, and the tunnel longitudinal temperature curve shows a heating characteristic throughout the entire process.
As displayed in Fig. 18 (c), under P-Condition, when the L increases from 200 m to 400 m, the heat gain in the heating segment increases by 30.51 × 103 kJ, while the heat loss in the cooling segment decreases by 0.63 × 103 kJ, further strengthening the heat accumulation effect. From the perspective of the overall tunnel heat budget (Fig. 18 (d)), the tunnel is always in a state of net heat gain under P-Condition, and the total heat gain shows an obvious upward trend with the increase of L: when the L = 200 m, the total heat gain of the tunnel is 168.47 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 20.12 kg of raw coal (calorific value 8374 kJ/kg); when the L = 400 m, the total heat gain reaches 199.61 × 103 kJ, equivalent to the combustion of 23.84 kg of raw coal. As the L increases from 200 m to 400 m, the net increase in total tunnel heat gain is 31.14 × 103 kJ, corresponding to an increase in equivalent raw coal mass of approximately 3.72 kg, which intuitively confirms the promoting effect of L on heat accumulation in the tunnel under P-Condition.
In summary, the analysis results show that L has a significant regulatory effect on the tunnel thermal environment: under N-Condition, a longer train will aggravate the overall heat dissipation inside the tunnel, which is unfavorable for tunnel anti-freezing; under P-Condition, however, a longer train will further promote the overall heat accumulation inside the tunnel, which is of positive significance for tunnel anti-freezing.
5. Conclusions
Based on temperature monitoring data from the Wafangdian Tunnel, two typical thermal conditions were defined to investigate the impact of high-speed train operations on the thermal environment under different thermal conditions. The influences of key parameters, including B, v, and L, on the tunnel thermal environment were systematically analyzed. The principal findings are summarized as follows:
(1)
Based on temperature monitoring results from the Wafangdian Tunnel, two typical thermal conditions were defined: the N-Condition, where the external air temperature is lower than the internal air temperature, and the P-Condition, where the external air temperature is higher than the internal air temperature.
(2)
Distinct temperature variation patterns were observed after train passage under the two thermal conditions. Under the N-Condition, the section within 0–400 m from the entrance experienced cooling. At 50 m into the tunnel, the cross-sectional temperature decreased from −2.41 °C to −5.0 °C, a reduction of 107.47 %. In contrast, the section between 400–595 m exhibited heating, with the temperature at 450 m increasing from −1.27 °C to −1.09 °C, a rise of 14.17 %. Under the P-Condition, the temperature variation differed: the 0–250 m section showed heating, with the temperature at 50 m rising from −2.41 °C to 2.96 °C; the 250–350 m section experienced cooling, where the temperature at 300 m decreased from −1.21 °C to −1.27 °C, a drop of 4.96 %; beyond 350 m, heating resumed, and at 450 m, the temperature increased from −1.27 °C to −1.10 °C, an increase of 13.39 %.

Under N-Condition, the train-induced wind acts as a “cold pump,” exacerbating heat loss within the tunnel. The net heat loss amounts to 85.22 × 103 kJ, which is unfavorable for thermal insulation in cold-region tunnels. Conversely, under P-Condition, the train-induced wind functions as a “heat source,” resulting in a cumulative net heat gain of 168.47 × 103 kJ. This amount of heat is equivalent to that produced by burning 20.12 kg of raw coal (with a calorific value of 8374 kJ/kg), thereby benefiting tunnel frost prevention. Therefore, the influence of P-Condition and N-Condition should be considered in the design of tunnel cold and frost resistance.

Factors B, v and L have a significant impact on the thermal environment of the tunnel. Under the N-Condition, increases in B, v, and L intensify heat dissipation, adversely affecting tunnel anti-freezing performance. In contrast, under the P-Condition, increases in these parameters enhance heat accumulation, which is beneficial for anti-freezing. Therefore, it is recommended to closely monitor thermal conditions during tunnel operation and maintenance, and to consider adjusting train operational parameters appropriately to enhance anti-freezing performance.
This study investigated the influence of train-induced wind on the thermal environment of tunnels under different thermal conditions, without considering factors such as natural wind and geothermal heat. The related influences need to be further explored in subsequent research.
