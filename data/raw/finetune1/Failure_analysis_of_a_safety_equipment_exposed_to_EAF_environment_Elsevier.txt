1. Introduction
The austenitic stainless steels are materials prone to Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in Cl− containing environments, as well described in the literature [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. The SCC frequently initiates by pits formation in components subjected to stresses that could also be internal such as those deriving from cold working. These pits usually act as local stress raisers that favor the crack formation, then propagation is speeded up by the corrosive process [[1], [2], [3], [4],[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. The crack nucleation is thus stimulated by the presence of Cl−, high temperature and metallurgical heterogeneities (sigma phase, delta ferrite, etc.) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]].
The literature is rich of case histories concerning fractures of austenitic stainless steels working in aggressive environments. These failures are reported occurring in many different technological fields (nuclear power, oil and gas or steel making plants etc.) [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Considering the environment, most of these failures have occurred in the presence of high chlorides containing media.
In the present work, the failure of a safety system for the inspection of a crane installed to load an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) has been investigated (Fig. 1a). This system is also made of cords and tensioners giving a sort of stiffness to the structure. The cords are strands of AISI 316 stainless steel wires cold drawn, while the tensioner is an AISI 316 hot stamped component that has been machined after the stamping process.

The squares indicate the regions of top view SEM analysis. The dotted line indicates the section for the microstructural analysis. The black arrows indicate the regions of cord-tensioner connection.

The system has been designed to bear the static loads (the tensile force needed to give stiffness to the structure) and some dynamic loads that are usually given by the vibrations induced by the crane operations and by the operators hooked to this system of cords, in order to perform the maintenance of the crane under safe conditions.
The use of stainless steel components in steel making plants was recently increasing for many applications at both room and high temperature such as: flare tips, tubes, mechanical elements, machine covers, etc.) [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. Therefore, in order to resist to a fast degradation due to the harsh environment composed by EAF dust, the system components have been designed in austenitic stainless steel. In fact, during low alloyed steel making operations, in particular when the furnace is extracted from the hood, EAF dust can leach from furnace and the climate variables such as humidity and temperature can favor the formation of condenses on the component. It is well known that the components close to the EAF could be subjected to the deposition of dust containing high amount of chlorides, sulphides and of low melting point metals that evaporated during the EAF process [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]].
Unexpectedly, the components studied in this experience already failed after a service life of about 2 months instead of a foreseen life of more than 3 years. As the components were yearly inspected to guarantee a safe use of the system, the failure was noted because some tensioners presented showy cracks and the cord showed a progressive detachment of some wires of the strand. It is to remark that the tensioner did not show a complete failure but only a deep crack inducing a not correct movement the system. On the other hand, it is likely that some small wires of the cord failed before the tensioner, because of the different dimension of the components.
The aim of this work is to find the causes of failure of these components by means of laboratory investigations in order to prevent the unexpected failure of the component and increase the reliability of the component.
2. Material and methods
The AISI 316 stainless steel components analyzed in this experience are shown in Fig. 1b). These components have been first visually inspected in order to determine macro details to be further analyzed. A sample of the dust deposited on the components was analyzed by SEM + EDXS using a Zeiss EVO 40+ INCA X sight equipment. The fractured surfaces of the tensioner and of a wire were also analyzed by SEM + EDXS in order to analyze the fracture morphology and to determine the failure mechanism. After surface cleaning in ultra sound bath (using ethanol as cleaning bath), SEM + EDXS analyses were performed on the components surface (white rectangles in Fig. 1b) in order to determine possible damages caused by the interaction with the environment. For both the components, some samples have been extracted in longitudinal direction in order to determine both the microstructure and the origin of possible internal defects. In the case of the cord, some debris of the strand were used, while for the tensioner the sample was extracted by refrigerated abrasive wheel cut. These samples were embedded in epoxy-resin, grinded and polished in order to obtain a mirror-like surface and then etched by acetic glyceregia (15 ml HCl, 10 ml HNO3, 10 ml acetic acid, 3 drops glycerine) for 60 s in order to evidence the microstructure. The samples were analyzed by light microscope (Olympus GX71) and Vickers microindenter (3 HV2 indentations for each sample in the material bulk). In particular, the wires underwent to microhardness measurement along the centerline. On the other hand, the microhardness on the tensioner have been performed in longitudinal section along the whole wall-thickness of the component. The same samples (cord and tensioner embedded in epoxy resin) used for the microstructural characterization underwent to SEM + EDXS analysis in order to determine both the chemical composition of the alloy and the internal defects.
3. Results
3.1. Visual inspection
Both the cord and the tensioner are completely covered by black dust (Fig. 1b) that will be chemically analyzed by means of SEM+ EDXS in the next paragraph.
The tensioner presents a deep crack at about the half of its length, that proceeds following a transversal direction with respect to the stresses applied by the cord passing through the two faces (black arrows in Fig. 1b) where a pin or a bolt is inserted. The main body of the tensioner seems to be completely stained and damaged, probably due to a corrosive attack. This hypothesis is supported by the very high roughness of the surface, which was very smooth when installed. The probability that the surface roughness has changed because of some mechanical damages is very low. In fact, the components are installed in a protected area where surface mechanical damage is almost impossible.
The cord shows many broken wires and these debris can be easily extracted from the strand. The core of the cord is intact, only the external wires are broken. It is likely that the small wires has broken before the tensioner because of the dimension of the component.
3.2. SEM analysis of the dust
The SEM + EDXS analyses of the dusts, collected from the failed components (cord and tensioner), are shown in Fig. 2. The summary of the chemical analyses, on the zones indicated in Fig. 2, are collected in Table 1, Table 2.

The EDXS results show that the dusts deposited on both the components (cord and tensioner) are almost the same. The dust is mainly composed by oxides. Moreover, Cl and S signals are also present. These elements are probably chemical compounds of the many metal present in the dust as Zn and Ca.
3.3. Analysis of the tensioner
The tensioner is the component that presents a marked crack in the mid zone. The images of the fracture surface acquired by SEM are shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. SEM fracture surface analysis of the tensioner. a) analyzed fracture surface, b) last failure fracture surface, c) crack nucleation site, d) crack propagation area.

The fracture surface is heavily corroded in all the analyzed areas. It seems that the fracture nucleated in the grey circle area and propagated in the direction indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 3a. The crack nucleation appears to be partly intergranular (see some metal grains clearly visible in Fig. 3c) whereas propagation areas seem to assume mainly a transgranular pathway (Fig. 3 d). Somewhere, it is possible to observe the presence of secondary cracks that are propagating perpendicularly to the main direction of the fracture propagation path. Finally, the fracture shows a more ductile appearance (dimples morphology that has been corroded) in the area of the final rupture (huge plastic deformation indicated by dotted circle in Fig. 3a).
The areas of EDXS analyses of the fracture surface are shown in Fig. 4 together with the collected data listed in Table 3.

The SEM + EDXS analysis on fracture surface shows that it is strongly oxidized and also covered by Zn rich deposits. Cl and S traces are also visible. The presence of these elements can probably be correlated to the EAF dust chemical composition previously analyzed (Table 2). The whole fracture surface is interested by the presence of these contaminants. The spectrum 4 suggests the presence of an unaltered surface. Indeed the EDXS analysis is the typical one of an austenitic stainless steel.
The SEM top view analysis of the external surface of the tensioner exposed to the aggressive environment, obtained in the area selected by the rectangle in Fig. 1b, is shown in Fig. 5 and the correlated EDXS data are collected in Table 4.

The SEM observation of the external surface of the tensioner highlights the presence of a heavily damaged area where a crack can be easily detected. The rough surface morphology, visible in some areas indicated by arrows in Fig. 5, is certainly due to a chemical attack of the material whereas some other areas still show the original flat surface of the component (area that corresponds to spectrum 4).
In the selected rough areas, high amounts of Cl can be detected, suggesting that deposits of EAF dust contaminated with these elements are still present in spite of the careful cleaning process carried out, whereas in the flat areas only the chemical composition of the AISI 316 stainless steel is obtained (spectrum 4 of Table 4).
The microstructure of the tensioner, extracted as indicated in Fig. 1b by the dotted line, is shown in Fig. 6. The microstructure is composed by austenite grains with an average size around 80 μm, in the subsurface region, and of about 35 μm at the core. Some bands, more marked at the sample core, produced during the hot rolling process are clearly visible, as well as some stress corrosion cracks showing typical branched features. The main crack in Fig. 6 has a length longer than 1 mm. As already observed on the fracture surface in Fig. 3, the crack morphology mainly follows an intergranular pathway in the subsurface region, becoming more transgranular and much more branched as the microstructure becomes finer.

At the corroded grain boundaries, more prone to the corrosion attack, the SEM analysis (spectra 1 and 2) highlights the presence of S, Cl, O and Zn signals related to the EAF dust chemical composition. This confirms the role of the dust in the observed corrosion phenomena. In the spectra 3 and 4 only the chemical composition of the AISI 316 stainless steel can be detected.
3.4. Analysis of the cord
The cord is composed by a strand of very thin wires of austenitic stainless steel. The fracture surface of one of these small wires is visible in Fig. 8.

The fracture surface is completely altered by a probable chemical aggression due to the same chemical elements found on the tensioner fracture surface (see EDXS spectra in Table 6). It is likely that the failure mechanism of the two components is similar, as well as the causes of failure. The brighter area in Fig. 8, where spectrum 1 was acquired, seems to be the final rupture area because of the presence of a lower amount of exogenous elements.

The wire presents a locally corroded surface due to the exposure to the steel making plant environment. Corroded areas are mainly close to the cracks where EAF dust is still present (see Table 7 spectra 1, 2 and 3). Spectrum 4 is representative of the not corroded AISI 316 steel.

Fig. 10. microstrctural characterization of one wire of the strand.

The micrograph clearly shows a cold worked microstructure with the austenitic grains strongly deformed in the longitudinal direction. In fact the material hardness is 382HV2, higher with respect to a solubilized material (tensioner hardness is of about 210 HV2), and corresponds to a strain hardened condition [23]. The crack in Fig. 10 initially grows perpendicularly with respect to the wire axis drifting towards a longitudinal direction when approaching the core of the wire. Moreover, crack morphology changes from a net transgranular shape close to the nucleation area to a more corroded morphology when the crack starts to bend in the core wire following the drawing directions.
EDXS analysis was carried out at the crack tip as shown in Fig. 11. Spectra 1 and 2 in Table 8 show that also at the crack tip Zn, Cl and S can be detected. These elements are present in high amount and are certainly correlated to the deposits found on the external surface of the wire.

Far away from the crack (spectrum 3), the chemical composition found is the typical one of the AISI 316.
5. Discussion
The visually inspected components apparently present different failure features. The cord, made of AISI 316 cold worked austenitic stainless steel wires, shows a diffuse fragmentation while the tensioner, made of the same but solubilized stainless steel, is cracked at its half. It is likely that the small wires of the cord failed before the tensioner, this because of the different dimension of the two components. The degradation of the components is very rapid (service life of about 3 months).
Both the components are covered by a fine grained dust containing Zn, Al, Si, Fe, Ca and Mg together with high Cl and S amounts as shown in Table 1, Table 2. Most of these elements are complex oxides and/or carbonates, as well reported by many authors that have analyzed the EAF powders [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], while Cl and S are mainly produced by organic residuals on metal scraps used in EAF [19].
The SEM observation of the tensioner cleaned surface exposed to the environment has shown the presence of spread localized corroded areas together with cracks nucleated next to these areas (Fig. 5). In spite of the careful cleaning process carried out, high amounts of Cl have been detected in the rough corroded areas (Table 4), confirming the EAF contaminants presence.
These findings suggest a possible initiation of SCC as confirmed by the in section microstructural characterization. In fact, Fig. 6 shows the presence of SCC cracks initiated with an intergranular shape and then propagated with a branched transgranular shape, more evident after certain depth from exposed surface. It is evident that the change of the fracture morphology corresponds to a change in the austenitic grain size, that is coarser (grain size of about 80 μm) close to the external surface compared to the core of the tensioner (grain size of about 35 μm). The EDXS analysis at the crack tip (Fig. 7) still highlighted the presence of Cl, O and Zn amounts confirming the presence of EAF contaminants traces and their role in the degradation process.
Finally, also the observation of the fracture surface of the failed tensioner has shown a heavily corroded morphology but, in this case, some intergranular features, mainly at the crack nucleation site, appear and can be related to a SCC phenomenon (Fig. 3). The crack propagation zone, instead, presents a cleavage morphology with striations typical of a corrosion assisted fracture (Fig. 3) [24]. Also the fracture surfaces shows the presence of a high amount of Cl, S and Zn (Fig. 4).
In spite of the different degradation morphology (cord fragmentation), the observation carried out on the cord have highlighted similar results as those obtained for the tensioner. Local corrosion of the external surface of the wires of the cord and crack initiation have been observed together with the presence of EAF contaminants residuals (Fig. 9), suggesting a SCC mechanism. This has been then confirmed by the longitudinal section microstructural characterization (Fig. 10). The main difference between the degradation phenomena observed in the two mechanical components is related to the propagation morphologies of the two cracks linked to their different microstructures (the cord is heavily strain hardened). In this case, after an initial clearly transgranular pathway [25], the crack propagation is affected by the stainless steel microstructure that leads to a deviation of the crack path along the rolling bands, enhancing the production of internal corrosion morphologies. The corrosive process proceed, probably, attacking the stressed grain boundaries in a way similar to an intergranular corrosion (Fig. 11). In this case, the fracture surface analysis did not give any information about fracture surface morphology, which was heavily corroded.
Both the tensile loaded components underwent to a SCC failure caused by sticking of EAF contaminants together with condensation of air humidity. The interaction of the condenses with EAF contaminants produced a very aggressive media, with high concentration of Cl and S, that locally corroded the stainless steel surfaces. The role of Cl ions is well known as for stainless steels SCC is concerned, moreover the presence of S has enhanced the intergranular SCC, as well indicated by many authors [[24], [25], [26], [27]]. The role of S is linked to the probable production of complex S acids that decrease the pH of the media and increase the susceptibility of the material to intergranular corrosion [24,25]. It is likely that the fast degradation of the component is due to the aggressive environment more than to the mechanical stress, although the last is necessary to activate the SCC process. Indeed, the crack morphologies, as well the EDXS analysis in the cracks, indicated the presence of a remarkable chemical attack (huge branching and presence of high Cl in the crack tips). The presence of Zn inside the crack could be linked to a possible dissolution of ZnO in the acid environment. Indeed, it is well known that the Zn oxide becomes soluble when the pH reaches low values (< pH 6) [28]. The presence of the Zn inside the crack could be considered as a marker of the pH reached in the corroded area.
In order to solve the problems linked to the SCC failure of these components, two solution could be suggested. The first one is to reduce the EAF contaminants deposition by both planning a periodic cleaning of the components and use e better capture of the EAF contaminants during the metallurgical operations. The second one is to use a more resistant material in particular using alloys with higher Ni content [[1], [2], [3]].
6. Conclusions
The present work has aimed to determine the causes of failure of a safety system for the inspection for the crane mechanism used to load the EAF. This system, composed by tensioners and cords, has failed after few months of in service life, when the expected life is at least 3 years.
The analyses have shown that the components suffered of SCC caused by the presence of EAF contaminants, stuck on components surface, that has been solubilized by humidity condensate on the external surface of the components. These components, designed in AISI 316, can not resist to the aggressiveness of the produced environment that under tensile loads caused a premature failure of the safety system.
The suggestion is to change the employed alloy, by using a material with higher Ni content and to improve the cleaning procedures of the components, foreseeing a periodical cleaning of the safety cord from EAF contaminants and reducing the processing of scrap material with high Cl content.
