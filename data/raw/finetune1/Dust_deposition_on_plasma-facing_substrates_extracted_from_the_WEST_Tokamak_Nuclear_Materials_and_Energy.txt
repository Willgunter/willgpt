1. Introduction
As ITER will implement a fully actively cooled tungsten (W) divertor [1], various studies in current tokamaks such as JET [2], ASDEX Upgrade [3], KSTAR [4], EAST [5] and more recently in the WEST tokamak [6] are devoted to advancing the current knowledge of plasma interaction with W plasma facing components (PFCs). In particular, WEST allows for an integrated test of ITER-like divertor PFCs under relevant tokamak plasma conditions. The WEST divertor is equipped with actively cooled Plasma Facing Units (PFUs) made of W mono-blocks similar to the technology used for the ITER divertor [7], [8], [9]. Due to its high atomic number, the erosion of W as an impurity may pose operational concerns due to the loss of plasma energy by radiation [10], [11]. W dust as erosion by-products can produce the same deleterious effect and, due to the large surface area, they could also affect tritium retention if produced in large quantities [12]. The safety implications for future nuclear facilities are critical. Dust can be a potential radiological hazard if released (due to activation by neutrons and tritium retention). Therefore, dust poses a health and safety risk in the event of (i) a loss-of-vacuum accident (LOVA), where dust becomes suspended in the air outside the vessel, and/or i(i) a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), where a dust explosion may occur in the vessel as a result of hydrogen gas production from steam [13]. Additionally, understanding dust behaviour can help prevent contamination and damage to plasma-facing components.
In general, tokamak dust is seen as spheroid particles and irregularly shaped particles called flakes composed of materials present in the wall of the tokamak vacuum vessel. They can also contain light elements and impurities injected during wall conditioning and plasma operations.
In ASDEX-Upgrade equipped with a full W wall, multiple dust investigations were conducted (2007–2009) [14], [15]. Silicon collector plates placed within stainless steel housings were used to ensure that only mobilized dust would be collected during the plasma campaigns. A large fraction of W and B dominated spherical dust was found and attributed to arcing. A fraction of irregularly shaped particles made of W, B, and C were collected without apparent interaction with the plasma, while another fraction was composed of particles passing through the plasma without complete ablation [14], [15]. Dust of other chemical compositions (Cu, Fe, others) were also evident. Log-normal size distributions have been established for W-dominated spheroid particles, the most probable size being within 1–
. For irregularly shaped particles, a most probable size around 0.
 was found [14], [15]. Other analyses also found a small amount of ferromagnetic dust originating from the stainless-steel vacuum chamber [16].
In JET, beryllium (Be) dust occurs mainly as co-deposit flakes and droplets formed on plasma-facing components (PFCs) [17]. These flakes often originate from inner wall coatings or Be-rich mixed co-deposits formed via material migration and may contain tungsten (W) particles sized 5–15 nm (see Fig. 4 in Rubel et al. [17]). Be dust is frequently enriched with carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and metallic traces such as W and Fe. Additional observations report Be in the form of spherical droplets, splashes, and small fragments of Be tiles [18]. Microscopy analyses revealed (i) an asymmetric distribution of Be particles, with the largest (125–550 
µ
) on tile side surfaces; (ii) highly porous, blister-like particles; and (iii) thin co-deposit flakes on shadowed divertor edges [19]. Tungsten (W) dust primarily originates from detached W coatings and is observed as partly molten flakes or ellipsoids produced by melting [17], [20]. W-rich particles are often associated with nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), and occasionally molybdenum (Mo) [20]. Other classes include W- and Ni-rich droplets from Inconel and mixed-material layers containing nanoscale (8–200 nm) W-Mo and Ni-based debris [21]. ellipsoids and splashes of other metallic elements have also been reported [20].
In Alcator C-Mod, large dust particles with a most probable diameter of 50 
µ
 and maximum diameter of 450 
µ
 were collected via the vacuuming technique. These included B and Mo flakes as well as B, Mo and W spheroids and splashes [22]. Fast cameras have revealed that such large dust particles originated mainly from the melting of slot edges of cryo-pumps and the leading edges of misaligned divertor modules during disruptions.
In the WEST tokamak, earlier dust samples were collected by using a Duster Box [23] pressed against the lower divertor (C2 campaign, 2017). Spherical particles resulting from the ejection of molten material droplets in the size range 5–30 
µ
 composed of all material present in the vacuum vessel were found. The focus was also on W spheres of diameter 10–15 
µ
 [24]. More recently, the classical vacuuming technique (C4 plasma campaign, 2019 and C5,2020–2021) was used on the lower divertor. In addition to W spheres in the micron size range, the presence of W-dominated dust particles of irregular shapes and surface roughness were attributed to the flaking of initial W coatings off carbon-based tiles of the lower divertor. Sizes varied from a few microns to several tens of microns and the dust particles could contain impurities such as C, B, O and traces of N [25]. Dust of varying size and composition (Cu, C, Ag, Fe, others) were also collected. Moreover, W nanoparticles with sizes as small as 5 nm were identified [25].
In this article, we present a detailed analysis of dust particles deposited on tungsten substrates placed on the first wall sample holders, extracted after two campaigns of the first phase of WEST operation (C3 and C4, conducted in 2018 and 2019, respectively). Micron- and submicron-sized dust particles, primarily resulting from tungsten erosion, were identified and characterised. Among these, we report for the first time a novel class of tungsten molten splashes with a distinctive morphology (referred to as “stethoscopes” due to their unique shape) exhibiting preferential orientations relative to the poloidal direction. In particular, this class of dust was not identified in the sample collected on the WEST divertor and previously reported [25] . In addition, submicron tungsten ellipsoidal particles (100–200 nm, larger than the nanoparticles also reported for WEST [25]) were found in significant quantities across the substrates.
The article is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the WEST tokamak setup and provides an overview of the various deposits observed on substrates extracted from different poloidal locations following the C3 and C4 campaigns. Section 3 presents a statistical analysis of the stethoscope-shaped tungsten splashes, including their size distributions, aspect ratios, and angular alignment upon deposition. Equivalent analyses are then provided for the sub-micron ellipsoidal particles. Section 4 discusses the morphology, spatial distribution, and deposition orientations of both particle types, with particular attention to the mechanisms responsible for their generation. The conclusions are summarised in Section 5.
2. Experimental setup, sample location and characterization techniques
2.1. Overview of WEST operation during campaigns C3 and C4
The WEST tokamak has a major plasma radius of 2.5 m and a minor plasma radius of 0.50 m for a plasma volume of 
 m
. A detailed description of the machine can be found in Bucalossi et al. [26], [6]. WEST was operated under the single-null lower divertor configuration during the C3 and C4 campaigns performed in 2018 and 2019.
The C3 deuterium plasma campaign took place in 2018 with a cumulative plasma duration of approximately 2 h and a total of 1076 plasma shots. An average of 0.7 MW and a maximum of 5.5 MW combined Ion-Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) and Lower Hybrid (LH) power was injected into the plasma, resulting in 
2.5 MW/m
 peak heat flux on the lower divertor. A total of 3 boronizations were performed throughout C3.
The campaign C4 was split into two separate sub-campaigns, C4 A and C4B, in 2019. The C4 A deuterium plasma campaign with a cumulative plasma duration of 
2 h and 45 min and a total of 1112 plasma shots had an average heating power of 
0.9 MW. A maximum combined ICRH and LH plasma heating of 8.8 MW resulted in 
6 MW/m
 peak heat flux on the lower divertor. The C4B Helium-Deuterium plasma campaign with a cumulative plasma duration of 
50 min and a total of 330 plasma shots had an average heating power of 
1.4 MW. A maximum combined ICRH and LH heating of 4.8 MW was used in C4B. C4 A and C4B included 5 and 8 boronizations, respectively. Discharges in WEST during the C3, C4 A and C4B campaigns were all highly disruptive, having associated disruptivities of 67.8% (730/1076), 67.9% (755/1112) and 83.3% (275/330), respectively. For a complete description, see Diez et al. [8], [9].
2.2. WEST layout and sample placement
The sample holders installed on the WEST first wall, in the far scrape-off layer region (a region characterised by low heat and ion flux under steady-state plasma conditions and dominated by charge-exchange interactions with neutral particles), enable accelerated studies of material evolution across successive campaigns. They provide an efficient means to characterise first-wall material changes without cutting or extraction, while maintaining similar particle exposure and temperature conditions. This approach also allows the effects of individual campaigns to be distinguished. The surfaces of sample holders are largely covered by boron layers deposited during wall conditioning, making them ideal for the retention and subsequent analysis of metallic impurities. Consequently, key mechanisms such as erosion, deposition, and particle collection can be effectively investigated.
The substrates used for this study were 7 × 7 mm
 recrystallised poly-crystalline W plates. They were mirror polished and recrystallised prior to installation on individual holders, located at four poloidal locations: 
°, 
°, 
°and 
°in two toroidal sectors labelled Q3 and Q6. Fig. 1(a) shows a cross section of the WEST tokamak [27], illustrating the positions of the substrates along the inner wall. Subsequently, the substrates were used as collectors during campaigns C3 and C4, being replaced after C3. It is important to note that laboratory experiments using tokamak-relevant materials and parameters have demonstrated limitations regarding the shapes and sizes of particles that can adhere to the samples [28]. In particular, due to the nearly vertical orientation of the substrates, only particles with a high sticking probability (such as liquids and small particles) are effectively captured. During these campaigns, WEST was operated in the lower single null configuration, with the contour of the poloidal magnetic flux shown in grey and the last closed flux surface shown in red. Fig. 1(b) shows a top-down view, with toroidal sections and outer wall peripherals labeled [27]. Q3B and Q6B (highlighted in orange) are the specific toroidal location where the samples were placed. Note the presence of an outer limiter in Q3 A and one of the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) antennas located in the Q4 A toroidal sector, adjacent to Q3B. The divertor modules used in the Q3B sector were made of passively cooled W-coated graphite tiles and actively cooled ITER-like W PFUs, some of which were pre-damaged [29]. PFUs were added and modifications were made to this sector after the C3 campaign [9]. Note the presence of a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) antena in the Q6 toroidal sector. During C3 and C4 the Q6 sector was covered only with W-coated graphite tiles. For further description of the peripherals and plasma facing units within WEST, see Bucalossi et al. [6]. Finally, previous studies have shown that sample exposed to C3 and C4 plasmas have deposits which have multilayer structures mainly composed of tungsten, oxygen, boron and carbon, whose texture and composition vary along the radial 0 direction [30]. This might lead to different adhesion properties.

2.3. Characterization techniques
Ex-situ, post mortem analyses of WEST inner wall samples were performed using: (1) confocal microscopy, (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and (3) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The application and significance for each of these techniques are described below:
1.
A Sensofar S Neox confocal microscope was used for the initial inspection of the WEST inner wall samples. Implementing a pin hole to block out-of-focus light, the microscope achieved an optical resolution up to 0.16 
µ
. Additionally, 3 dimensional (3D) images were generated by combining multiple 2D image slices, at incremental focal depths on the sample. By properly tuning the intensity of incident light on the sample, true color images were obtained, emulating the color seen with the naked eye.
2.
Higher resolution images of the sample surfaces were obtained using a Zeiss Gemini 500 FE-SEM microscope. Three detectors were used. First, the In-Lens Secondary Electron detector was used to display detailed surface structure of individual dust particles. Second, the High Efficiency - Secondary Electron (HE-SE) lateral detector was used to obtain the majority of images analyzed in this study. The HE-SE detector emphasizes the topography of the sample and as such, assists in the identification of dust particles on the surface. Additionally, HE-SE images have over an order of magnitude larger field of view than In Lens images, allowing for imaging large areas of the sample. Finally, the Back-Scattered Electron Detector (BSE) - for measurement of scattering at low angles and enhanced atomic number Z contrast images - was used to image features which were present under the immediate surface of the sample. Some of which include cracks within the bulk of dust particles which were observed when using sufficiently high (20 kV) acceleration voltage and many blisters, which appear much darker than the tungsten surface (at 15 kV acceleration voltage). The top of the SEM images is always vertically upward in the machine.
3.
An EDAX Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) detector, coupled to the Zeiss Gemini 500 was also used to acquired spectra for identification of the elemental composition present near the sample surface and for determining dominant elements. In order to have sufficient X-ray emission intensity to detect W-M, B-K, O-K and C-K lines, an acceleration voltage of 5 kV was chosen. Spectra were measured using two particular techniques: (1) EDS Spots, measuring detailed spectrum that are precisely referenced to an SEM image location, or (2) EDS mappings, which construct an image of chemical element distributions based on the assignment of elements in the collected spectra to locations on the surface. Acquisition times for these images were typically between 4 - 7 min.

3. Analyses of the substrates
3.1. Overview of inner-wall substrate surfaces after C3 and C4
Various thin film deposits on the substrates have been analyzed after C3 and C4 campaigns. The features of these deposits vary according to the tokamak operation and sample location. Fig. 2 shows the poloidal location of the substrates on the inner wall. The inset is a confocal microscope image in true color representation of the C4-Q3-50°sample. A green film covers all parts of the sample except the grey and pink areas on the edges, which were either completely or partially shadowed from plasma exposure by the sample holder. Pieces of rolled film (in black) can be seen scattered on top of the coloured film, and appear to originate from damaged areas at the edges of samples. Note that, for a more detailed analysis, only the 
4 mm
 area outlined by the orange square is considered. This selection excludes the shadowing effect caused by the sample holder and edge damage due to sample handling.
Fig. 3(a) shows an HE-SE SEM image of the C4-Q3
°sample (see inset of Fig. 2). A thin film has been smoothly deposited on the large grains of the recrystallised tungsten (W). Few bright particles have been deposited on top of this film. Many blisters are also seen, including one that has burst in the bottom left corner which reveals the W substrate underneath. Note, the blistering shown does not represent the majority of the sample’s surface. Fig. 3(b) is an EDS mapping of the same region, including a colour scale and the percent content found for the whole mapping per element in the inset. It shows that the thin film is composed primarily of boron (B) / B-oxide (red and blue for B and O, respectively). The W substrate (in green) can be directly seen underneath the film at the location of an open blister but W is also seen in the film. Consequently, the analysis of the composition of the deposited particles can be complicated by the presence of W below the B-dominated film, since W from the substrate also contributes to EDX signals.
Statistics on the different dust types are obtained from measurements made on SEM images acquired at an acceleration voltage, a working distance and pixel size in the ranges of 1.00–5.00 kV, 3.9–5.0 mm, 1.86–18.01 nm, respectively. Typically, the smaller working distance and pixel size were used for measuring the smallest particles types, while the larger working distance and pixel size were used for the larger and less numerous particles (with these images having a larger field of view). For 8 out of 9 samples discussed in this articles, between 7 and 12 images were analysed across the central 
 4 mm
 square region (see inset of Fig. 2), spanning 
 of the considered surface. In the case of the C4-Q3
°substrate, flaking of the deposited thin film made the imaging of the surface especially difficult and only 4 images were usable, covering only 
 of the central (
 4 mm
) sample surface.

°sample revealing a thin deposited film, few bright sub-micrometer particles and many blisters. (b) EDS mapping of a. The burst blister reveals the primary W substrate underneath.

Splashes and dust of various sizes and shapes, formed by droplets composed of different molten materials, presumably during off-normal events were observed in multiple locations across the surface of the substrates (with impurities coming from the delamination of the W layer of the inertially cooled graphite divertor tiles and/or the antenna protections, sputtering of LH antennas waveguides, sputtering of the stainless steel panels and transport of W from other PFCs [9]). However, a detailed analysis of such dust is not presented in this article, as it has already been reported in previous studies on WEST [24], [25], [31] or other tokamaks (see for example Arnas et al., Rubel et al., Rohde et al. [22], [17], [32]).

°sample. (b) Corresponding EDS spectra for the locations indicated in (a). EDS Spots 1 and 2 show different points on the stethoscope. EDS Spot 3 shows deposited film on the W substrate.

3.2. Stethoscope-shaped tungsten splashes
Stethoscope-shaped tungsten splashes (or simply “stethoscopes”) are characterised by their elongated shape with approximate bilateral symmetry, containing both a head and two legs. Fig. 4(a) shows a HE-SE SEM image of a typical one found on the C3-Q3-70°substrate. The corresponding EDS are shown in Fig. 4(b): EDS Spots 1 and 2 are located at different positions on the stethoscope, while EDS Spot 3 is located on the substrate. EDS spot sizes are 10 nm in diameter. Spots 1 and 2 reveal a similar composition; only a slight variation in W and O content is observed. Note the dominant W peaks and a diminished B peak in spots 1 and 2. Spot 3 differs as it reveals a higher B content and a lower W content. EDS analyses suggest that the stethoscope is mainly made of W.
Stethoscopes were found almost exclusively at 
°, with the exception of a few outliers observed at 
°. Figs. 5(a) and (b) are HE-SE SEM images at the same scale illustrating their number density and shapes identified on the C3-Q3
°and C4-Q3
°substrates, respectively. The inset of Fig. 5(b) zooms in on the surface, showing two sub-micron stethoscopes. By inspection, stethoscopes are larger and have greater size variance in C4 compared to C3.

°substrate. (b) Stethoscopes deposited on C4-Q3

Fig. 6 shows a series of In-Lens SEM images of these particles identified on the C3-Q3
°substrate. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the typical bilaterally symmetric shape. Four characteristic lengths are defined to quantitatively describe the shape (see the labels on Fig. 6(a)): the major and minor diameters (
 and 
, respectively) and, the head length and head width (
 and 
, respectively). The direction indicated by the 
-axis points upwards, away from the lower divertor. The angle 
 between the 
-axis and 
, oriented from leg to head, represents the orientation direction on the substrate surface and is defined as positive clockwise from the 
-axis. Fig. 6(b) shows a closed-legged particle, seemingly formed of irregular melt layers not seen in other images of Fig. 6. Fig. 6(c) shows two particles: the right one is a typical stethoscope as in Fig. 6(a); the left one seems to be a droplet with a crater at the top. Fig. 6(d) illustrates a stethoscope having narrower legs than its head, and no elongation of the head. It appears to be smooth, indicating a previous melting of the surface. Many other stethoscope-shaped splashes were identified on substrates located at 
°. Note that on this substrate, they were found on columnar deposited layers.
Stethoscopes’ morphology has been statistically analysed. Their dimensions were manually measured with a maximum error of 
18 nm. Figs. 7(a–c) show their length (
) distributions and Figs. 7(d–f) show their aspect ratio (
) distributions, measured on substrates located at 
°. Here, the aspect ratio represents the elongation. The corresponding campaign and toroidal sectors (C3-Q3, C3-Q6 and C4-Q3) are marked on individual sub-figures. The length (
µ
) distributions were then fit to a log-normal probability distribution function (PDF), scaled to fit the number of measured particles (
) per unit surface area (
) as shown below:

, 
), mean size, variance and count density are summarised in Table 1.

In addition to their morphology, the stethoscope angular alignment on the substrate surfaces has been analysed. Fig. 9(a) shows a stethoscope deposited at an angle of 
 
°with respect to the 
-axis. Fig. 9(b) shows an image of the WEST tokamak HFS wall, near the

°is along the 
-axis. The region delimited by the red vertical dashed lines located at 
°indicates the range of deposition angle in which the majority of stethoscopes were found (corresponding to the highlighted red section in Fig. 9b). The preferred upward orientation can also clearly be seen in Fig. 5. Note that stethoscopes located on the C3-Q3

°(Fig. 10a).

3.3. Ellipsoid sub-micron dust particles
Ellipsoid particles (or simply ellipsoids), are W sub-micron particles with an aspect ratio close to 1, which are found on the substrates analyzed in this article. Unlike Stethoscopes, they were found on all poloidal locations. Figs. 10(a–d) show HE-SE SEM images of ellipsoids seen as dispersed white dots after campaign C3 on the substrates located on the Q6 toroidal sector at four poloidal angles ranging from 
°to 
°. Their number density is visibly higher at 
°(Fig. 10a) compared to the other poloidal locations. The inset of Fig. 10(a) zooms in on the surface, showing higher resolution ellipsoids. Similarly to stethoscopes, the alignment of ellipsoids on the substrates’ surface was determined by manually measuring the angle of their major axis with respect to the 
-axis. However, due to the reflection symmetry of ellipsoids about both their major and minor axes, their deposition angle was measured modulo 
°. Note that ellipsoids deposited on the surface of larger dust particles (similar to those shown by C. Arnas [25]) are excluded from the statistics presented in this article.
Figs. 11(a–d) show the distribution of ellipsoid major diameters found on C3-Q3 substrates located at the poloidal angles 
°, 
°, 
°and 
°, respectively. Figs. 11(e–h) show the corresponding aspect ratio distributions. Similarly as was done for stethoscopes, the length distribution histograms have bin width equal to twice the measurement error and the vertical error bars correspond to the square root of the bin count. Ellipsoid length distributions are fitted with Eq. (1), with fit parameters given in Table 2.
Figs. 11(a–d) and Table 2 indicate that the ellipsoid number density on substrates located at 
°(Fig. 11d), near the lower divertor, is more than two orders of magnitude higher than on substrates located at all other poloidal locations (Figs. 11a–c). Moreover, ellipsoids found at 
°are smaller (about half the mean size compared to ellipsoids found at other poloidal locations) and quasi monodisperse (smaller variance and smaller variations of the aspect ratio distributions). All other poloidal locations show number densities 
–10
 particles/mm
, with the 
°substrate’s density being more than twice the number density at 
°and 
°.

C4-Q3 substrates have been analyzed in the same manner as C3-Q3 substrates. These results are also summarized in Table 2. The corresponding major diameter and aspect ratio distributions are plotted in Figs. 11(i–p). The ellipsoid number density at 
°is lower than it was for C3-Q3, though it is still over an order of magnitude higher than number densities at all other poloidal locations. Additionally, the highest number density in C4-Q3 is found near the lower divertor (
°) as for C3-Q3 and diminishes with increasing distance from the divertor. The ratio of density on the 
°sample to that on 
°sample for C3 (
 120) is much larger than C4 (
 13). The aspect ratio of ellipsoids in C4 is comparable to C3, though the variance in the size distributions is consistently higher in C4. Note that, for both C3 and C4, the aspect ratio distributions show that particles are more spherical at 
° than at any other poloidal location.
Fig. 12 shows the number density of ellipsoids as functions of the poloidal angle for both C3-Q3 and C4-Q3 (using data extracted from Table 2). The number densities for each campaign were then fitted to the following exponential function:

4. Discussion
Analysis of the stethoscope-shaped particles found on substrates positioned along the HFS of the WEST first wall suggests they originate from molten metal droplets that splashed and slid across the surface. This distinctive morphology arises from a complex interplay between spreading dynamics, inertia, and resolidification. The final shape is influenced by factors such as collision angle, droplet velocity, material properties, size, and temperature, as well as the thermal and material characteristics of the substrate [33], [34]. The majority of stethoscope heads point upward, away from the lower divertor and stethoscopes are found nearly exclusively on 
°samples, suggesting that the lower divertor is their main source. The presence of heads oriented downwards likely reveal curved trajectories of the initial droplets emitted either in a direction closer to the vertical or from more distant areas of the lower divertor. Figs. 9(d–e) show that except for a few stethoscopes pointing down, the toroidal number distribution is relatively narrow and symmetric with respect to 
 = 0°(
°, 
°). It could be the result of a single droplet spray or more likely, several sprays from the same area located below. In contrast, Fig. 9(c) shows an imbalance with respect to 
 = 0°. There are more stethoscopes oriented in the angular interval (0°, +50°) as well as pointing downwards around 
 = 150°. This indicates that droplet trajectories can also be preferentially tilted and hence directed towards positive angles. It is also possible that the droplets are preferentially produced on the left hand side of the substrate on the divertor below. Furthermore, their specific shape (head and legs) may be due to the emission of sufficiently molten material at high speed, in addition to a low adhesion on substrates close to room temperature [34], [35], [36]. The narrow length distribution around 
 (dashed line in Fig. 8) corresponding to the equality between the head and leg lengths, illustrates the noticeable correlation between the head length (
) and the total length (
).
Ellipsoid particles have major diameters that are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the length of stethoscopes (
). Hence, they are lighter and can be thrown further away and have been found on substrates located on all 4 poloidal positions. The largest number densities are observed on the samples at 
°with quasi mono-disperse distributions as shown in Fig. 11(d) and 11(l) for both plasma campaigns. Additionally, at the poloidal position 
°, they are almost spherical with a most probable aspect ratio 
 which exponentially decreases to a measured maximum value of 
. In comparison, for the upper poloidal positions (shown in Fig. 11), the aspect ratios can reach 
 indicating a greater elongation of the particles. These features indicates that the ellipsoid particle were droplets mainly produced on the lower divertor that reached the substrates at a more tangential angle when the poloidal angle increased. However, it cannot be entirely ruled out that some of the nanoparticles examined in this study (likely the smallest and most spherical ones) were formed through physical vapour deposition from the gas phase.
The deposition angle distributions for ellipsoids are wide (
°, 
°) compared to that for stethoscopes. On the lowest poloidal position (
°) of C4, more particles were deposited in the interval 
°
°. This may be correlated with the deposition angle distribution of stethoscopes located on the same substrate (Fig. 9e) and mainly deposited in the interval 
°
°. It might indicate a common origin of production. In addition, the wider deposition angle distribution with respect to that of stethoscopes could be due to their lower mass, and thus, trajectories that were less inertially driven. When the poloidal position increases, the deposition angle distributions become more and more homogeneous due to the exponential decrease of the number of particles which naturally smooths the distribution inhomogeneities.
On the lowest poloidal position (
°) of the C3 campaign (Fig. 13f), more ellipsoid particles were found at large (positive and negative) deposition angles. As for C4 campaign, a correlation with the stethoscope deposition angles on the same substrate might be attempted. Fig. 9(c) shows that the deposition angle of stethoscopes is inhomogeneous with more particles deposited with positive angles. This result could be correlated to the large number of ellipsoids deposited with large deposition angles (positive or negative, the deposition angle of ellipsoids being given modulo 180°). Fig. 13(e) also shows that at higher poloidal position (−50°), there are more ellipsoid particles deposited with negative angles. This may also indicate other sources of ellipsoid particle emission. This can also be seen at the poloidal locations 0°and +50°but with a smoothing effect on the angle distribution due to a much smaller number of measured ellipsoids.
Emission of droplets of molten material have already been observed in metallic tokamaks during off-normal events. In the WEST tokamak, it has been shown that runaway electrons and disruptions can produce tungsten spherical particles of size reaching several microns [24], [25] as well as tungsten dust of irregular shapes but with rounded edges, that can contain various impurities [25]. Very few micron-sized spheres, generated by high energy off-normal events, were found attached to the present substrates (not shown here). The dust particles presented as stethoscopes and ellipsoids are rather attributed to arcing whose traces were observed on the trailing edges of W-coated graphite tiles (near the inner-wall) mainly composing the lower divertor of WEST during the C3 and C4 plasma campaigns [8]. Additionally, W monoblock edges installed in the Q3B sector clearly show traces of damage such as melting and cracks (the latter most likely originating from transient high heat flux events) [9]. For some trailing edges of tiles, arcing led to melting and likely the delamination of W coatings. The explanation of arcing phenomenon in this region of the divertor is still unclear but it is routinely observed on tungsten surfaces of tokamaks [32] and presented usually as a significant source of dust particles [14], [15].
5. Conclusion
Dust particles deposited on substrates positioned at four poloidal locations along the inner wall of the WEST tokamak were analysed following plasma campaigns C3 and C4. Their composition, morphology, and deposition direction indicate that they originated from the emission of molten tungsten droplets from the lower divertor region. Two representative particle types were studied in detail: (i) particles with shapes resembling stethoscopes (
 0.75–1.5 
µ
) and (ii) ellipsoidal particles (
100–200 nm major diameter).
The distinctive stethoscope-shaped particles likely result from a combination of factors, including the quantity and temperature of the ejected material, high ejection velocities, and the relatively low temperature of the substrates (particularly those covered with deposited porous layers). These particles were found almost exclusively on the substrate closest to the lower divertor, with the exception of three observed on the adjacent substrate during campaign C4. They appeared in large numbers, followed a log-normal size distribution, and exhibited angular alignment predominantly directed away from the lower divertor.
In contrast, the smaller and lighter ellipsoidal particles were observed in significant quantities on all four poloidal positions. They also followed log-normal size distributions. On the substrate closest to the divertor, these particles were nearly monodisperse and quasi-spherical. On the more distant substrates, however, they appeared increasingly elongated, suggesting they had reached the substrate at a more tangential angle compatible with an ejection from the lower divertor.
The formation of both particle types is likely linked to arcing events, evidence of which has previously been observed on the edges of tungsten-coated graphite tiles in the lower divertor near the inner wall. As known from arcing studies, the resulting droplets are typically small, on the order of a micrometer. In contrast, droplets generated by splashing from unstable molten pools during energetic transients are significantly larger, on the order of the melt pool depth—typically ranging from several tens to hundreds of microns [36].
