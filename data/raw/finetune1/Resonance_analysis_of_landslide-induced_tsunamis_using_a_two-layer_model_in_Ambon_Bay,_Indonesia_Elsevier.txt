1. Introduction
Eastern Indonesia, particularly the Banda Sea region as presented in Fig. 1a, is a tectonically complex zone with a long history of seismic and tsunami activity (Hamilton, 1979; McCaffrey, 1988; Spakman and Hall, 2010; Pownall et al., 2016). While most high-profile tsunami events in Indonesia have occurred in its western regions, the eastern part—such as Ambon Bay—remains understudied, despite documented historical disasters and its tectonic vulnerability. A comprehensive understanding of tsunami hazards in this region requires both historical analysis and modern modeling techniques.

The 2018 Palu tsunami demonstrated how complex topography and non-seismic triggers, such as submarine landslides, can amplify disaster impacts. Although the triggering earthquake was strike-slip in nature, the resulting tsunami impact suggested that mass movement along unstable underwater slopes was a critical contributing factor (Gusman et al., 2019; Pakoksung et al., 2019; Socquet et al., 2019). This highlights the importance of considering submarine landslides in tsunami hazard assessments, particularly in narrow or semi-enclosed coastal areas with steep bathymetry.
Submarine landslides, either triggered by seismic activity or natural slope failure, are recognized tsunami sources worldwide. Examples include the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami (Heinrich et al., 2001; Kawata et al., 1999; Tappin et al., 1999), the 2018 Anak Krakatau flank collapse in the Sunda Strait (Pakoksung et al., 2020; Heidarzadeh et al., 2020; Muhari et al., 2019; Patton et al., 2018; Syamsidik et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020), and potentially the 2004 Mw 9.2 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2011 Tohoku tsunami events, where both thrust faulting and sediment failure might have contributed to tsunami generation (Sibuet et al., 2007; Song et al., 2005; Tappin et al., 2014). Recent studies on subaerial and submarine landslide tsunami generation highlight advances in numerical modeling and validation (Sabeti and Heidarzadeh, 2022). In many of these cases, the geometry of the basin or bay played a role in trapping energy and creating resonant oscillations along the coast.
In the context of the Ambon Bay, historical records point to significant tsunami events related to seismic and possible submarine landslide activity. Notably, on February 17, 1674, an earthquake-induced tsunami with an estimated run-up of 100 m devastated the northern coast of Ambon Island, claiming over 2300 lives (Rumphius, 1975; Rumphius, 1997). A later event on October 8, 1950, known locally as “Tanah Goyang” and “Air Turun Naik,” affected three villages but remains poorly documented due to political unrest. Eyewitness accounts preserved on dedicated platforms now serve as critical resources for understanding the bay's tsunami history.
Despite growing recognition of submarine landslides as a significant source of tsunamis, especially in tectonically active and topographically confined regions corresponding the Ambon Bay, most existing studies focus primarily on earthquake-induced tsunami generation (Gasperini et al., 2022; Zitter et al., 2012; Heidarzadeh et al., 2017). While recent events such as the 2018 Palu tsunami have highlighted the destructive potential of non-seismic triggers, modeling approaches often rely on simplified single-layer hydrodynamic models (Heidarzadeh and Mulia, 2022; Heidarzadeh et al., 2023; Mulia et al., 2024; Setyonegoro et al., 2024; Sepúlveda et al., 2020; Karima et al., 2024) that inadequately represent the complex interactions between submarine mass movements and the water column. Furthermore, limited research has explored the resonance characteristics of tsunami generated by submarine landslides in semi-enclosed coastal basins. A few studies incorporate high-resolution spectral analysis—such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Hovmöller diagrams —to characterize resonance patterns, edge waves, and energy amplification along coastlines (Pakoksung et al., 2023a, Pakoksung et al., 2023b; Melgar and Ruiz-Angulo, 2018). Therefore, identifying the resonant periods of Ambon Bay is essential for understanding how landslide-generated tsunamis may be amplified within the bay. Resonance-driven oscillations can amplify wave heights and prolong inundation, even when the initial tsunami wave is moderate, making resonance a critical factor in hazard assessment for semi-enclosed basins.
In particular, the Ambon Bay is without the subject of an integrated modeling and spectral analysis study that examines both the generation and resonance behavior of tsunamis from submarine landslides. This presents a critical research gap in both tsunami hazard assessment and methodological development for tsunami-prone coastal regions.
To address this gap, the present study employs a two-layer numerical model that simulates the interaction between fluidized sediment and seawater in a landslide scenario to generate a tsunami. To analyze the tsunami wave behavior, we apply spectral methods—including FFT and Hovmöller diagrams—to identify resonance modes, wave reflections, and frequency characteristics. along the Ambon Bay coastline. This integrated approach offers valuable insights for disaster risk reduction in similarly vulnerable coastal areas.
The two-layer landslide–tsunami model was employed in this study that has been previously validated on the real events, including the 2018 Palu Bay tsunami (Pakoksung et al., 2019) and the 2018 Anak Krakatau tsunami (Pakoksung et al., 2020). These validations confirm the applicability of the model to landslide-generated tsunami scenarios and provide confidence in its use for Ambon Bay.
The present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and methodological framework, including slope stability analysis, two-layer numerical modeling, and spectral analysis. Section 3 presents the results of the landslide scenario simulation, tsunami wave propagation, and resonance behavior. Section 4 discusses the implications of the findings, including tsunami amplification patterns, regional risk, and study limitations. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of key insights and recommendations for hazard assessment and future research.

The methodology of this study consists of slope stability analysis, landslide scenario development, two-layer tsunami simulations, and spectral analysis of wave oscillations, as summarized in the framework diagram (Fig. 2).

Methodological framework of this study, integrating slope stability analysis, landslide scenario development, two-layer tsunami simulations, and spectral analysis of resonance effects in Ambon Bay. The workflow explains the sequence from slope failure assessment to tsunami generation, propagation, and resonance assessment.

2.1. Topography and bathymetry data
We obtained detailed topographic and bathymetric data for the Ambon Bay region from Indonesia's national geospatial agency, Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG). The bathymetric data were sourced from the National Bathymetric Data (BATNAS) at a spatial resolution of approximately 180 m, while land topography data were acquired from the Digital Elevation Model Nasional (Demnas) at an 8-m resolution (BATNAS; Dempster, 2000). To ensure consistency and seamless integration between datasets, both were resampled to a unified resolution of 30 m, as shown in Fig. 1c. This process produced a comprehensive Digital Elevation Model (DEM) grid covering the entire Ambon Bay area, comprising 1065 columns and 778 rows. Even though a 30-m resolution might not be extremely high compared to site surveys scale, however, it is significantly finer than most regional tsunami simulations (100–500 m). The 30-m resolution can represent the highest obtainable bathymetric dataset for Ambon Bay.
2.2. Landslide scenario analysis
To evaluate potential landslide-prone areas contributing to tsunami generation, we employed the SHALSTAB (Shallow Landslide Stability) model—a physically based approach that integrates hydrologic and geotechnical parameters to assess slope stability under varying saturation conditions (Montgomery and Dietrich, 1994; Dietrich and Montgomery, 1998; Geohazard Plugin). Although originally developed for rainfall-triggered landslides on hillslopes, the SHALSTAB model provides a useful framework for assessing slope stability, and was adapted here to evaluate submarine slope failures under fully saturated conditions.
SHALSTAB estimates slope stability by calculating the ratio of resisting with a driving forces along a potential failure plane near the surface, under both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions (Dietrich et al., 2001; Castelli et al., 2025). The model uses a modified infinite slope equation that incorporates terrain slope, soil cohesion, internal friction angle, unit weight, and saturation depth. It is formulated as:
(1)
where 
 is the safety factor, 
 is the soil cohesion (kPa), 
 is the unit weight of the soil (kN/m3), 
 is the unit weight of water (typically 9.81 kN/m3), 
 is the soil depth (m), 
 is the slope angle (
), 
 is the internal friction angle (
), and 
 is the dimensionless ratio of water table height to soil depth (saturation ratio).
To assess the potential for submarine landslides along the slopes of the Ambon Bay, we adapted the SHALSTAB model, which was originally developed for evaluating shallow, rainfall-triggered slope failures in hillslope environments. For application in underwater settings, the model was modified by assuming fully saturated soils (saturation ratio 
) and incorporating the effects of buoyant weight to account for submerged loading. This adaptation allows SHALSTAB to estimate slope stability under submarine conditions, enabling identification of zones vulnerable to landslide initiation. To determine landslide depth, it assumed that areas with 
 represent unstable zones that might experience full-depth failure. The soil thickness parameter (
), ranging from 1 to 50 m, was consequently used to identify the landslide depth distribution across unstable slopes.
Although SHALSTAB was originally developed for rainfall-triggered landslides in hillslopes. The submarine pressure regimes and sediment rheology might contrast from soils on land; this conservative adaptation provides a first-order assessment of slope instability in Ambon Bay. The approach is therefore suitable for identifying zones most susceptible to submarine slope failure. This study recognizes that seismic shaking is a possible trigger for slope failures in tectonically active regions such as Ambon Bay; however, this aspect cannot be directly incorporated into SHALSTAB and therefore was not included in this study. To improve robustness, sensitivity tests were conducted by varying soil strength parameters such as cohesion and friction angle reported for Indonesian submarine sediments (Somphong et al., 2022).
This approach accounts for reduced shear strength under submerged conditions and is appropriate for modeling landslide scenarios on the seafloor. A safety factor less than 1.0 indicates a slope that is potentially unstable and prone to failure. To perform this analysis, we derived slope angles and soil layer thickness from the 30-m resolution DEM generated for the Ambon Bay. Geotechnical parameters, including effective cohesion, friction angle, and unit weight, followed Somphong et al. (2022). These parameters are summarized in Table 1. The computed safety factors were spatially mapped to identify zones with high landslide susceptibility (Fig. 3). Areas where the safety factor fell below the critical threshold were considered for subsequent tsunami simulation modeling using the two-layer wave model.

(b) Probability histogram of safety factor values, highlighting the frequency of marginally stable slopes across the study area.

The value of each soil parameter was collected based on geotechnical ground survey of sediments around the Palu bay area in Indonesia (Somphong et al., 2022). These parameters are consistent with previous study that applied the SHALSTAB framework for submarine slope stability and landslide-tsunami analysis (Macías et al., 2015; Pakoksung et al., 2019, 2020). Using these values certifies a realistic representation of the weakly consolidated sediments typically found in the Ambon Bay.
The slope stability analysis was applied in a GIS framework, demanding digital elevation/bathymetry data, soil parameters (cohesion, internal friction angle, unit weight), and pore pressure assumptions. Safety Factor (FS) map was the result for identifying potentially unstable slopes.
2.3. Two-layer wave propagation modeling
A specialized two-layer numerical model was developed to simulate landslide-generated tsunamis in the Ambon Bay. The model solves the nonlinear shallow water equations and incorporates appropriate kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the water surface, the interface between layers, and the seafloor (Pakoksung et al., 2019, 2020; Imamura and Imteaz, 1995). The objective is to represent the interactions between submarine landslides and tsunami generation. The unstable slopes (
) were used to define landslide source areas and depth distributions, which were input to the two-layer landslide–tsunami model.
The governing equations in the model are based on a depth-averaged, stratified two-layer system. The upper layer is treated as a homogeneous, inviscid fluid with constant density 
 (1024 kg/m3), representing seawater. The lower layer represents a fluidized granular material with a solid grain density 
 of 2000 kg/m3 and porosity 
 of 0.35. The effective density of the fluidized debris layer is given by 
, it is assumed that the water and debris layers are unmixable. The value of the model's parameters followed Macías et al. (2015), that their model simulated submarine landslide-generated tsunamis using a similar two-layer approach. The parameters provide an effective debris density consistent with previous landslide-tsunami studies (Pakoksung et al., 2019, 2020; Lahcene et al., 2021; Nagai et al., 2021; Somphong et al., 2022; Al Farizi et al., 2025). The governing equations for the two-layer model are as follows:
Continuity equation for the first layer:
(3)
Momentum equations for the first layer in the 
 and 
 directions:
(4)
Continuity equation for the second layer:
(5)
Momentum equations for the second layer in the 
 and 
 directions:

where 
 indices 1 and 2 refer to the upper and lower layers, respectively. 
 denotes the surface elevation of each layer, and 
 are the depth-integrated discharges in the 
 and 
 directions. 
 represents the thickness of each layer, 
 is the gravitational acceleration, 
 is Manning's roughness coefficient, and 
 is the respective density.
The equations were solved numerically using a finite difference scheme implemented on an Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) platform to enable efficient parallel computation. In this framework, the landslide layer is assumed to be in equilibrium (zero velocity) prior to failure. Upon triggering, the model simulates near-field tsunami generation, propagation, and coastal run-up.
In this study, the tsunami source was generated dynamically rather than prescribed as a static deformation. The spatial thickness of the submarine landslide was first derived from slope stability analysis and assigned to the lower layer of the two-layer model. The subsequent motion of the slide was calculated using the depth-averaged continuity and momentum equations (Equations (5), (6))), which determine the temporal change in slide thickness and downslope velocity. As the moving sediment mass displaced the overlying water, the resulting water surface elevation and velocity fields were computed directly from the two-layer governing equations. Physically, this process follows the recognized mechanism of landslide-generated tsunamis, wherein the downslope motion of sediment creates seabed deformation that induces depression near the head of the slide and uplift near the toe, producing both positive and negative waves that subsequently propagate outward (Pakoksung et al., 2019). In this study, a simultaneous failure of all unstable slopes was assumed to represent a conservative worst-case scenario for tsunami generation.
The two-layer landslide–tsunami model was done by three main steps: (1) definition of initial landslide geometry (depth distribution) from slope stability outputs; (2) input parameters into the two-layer coupled with landslide–water motion; and (3) propagation of generated waves across the computational domain. The model domain was discretized at 30-m resolution (
) and time step of 
 seconds was used (Pakoksung et al., 2019, 2020), confirming Courant numbers 
 during the simulation (LeVeque et al., 2011). In addition, conservation of mass and energy was tracked, with errors consistently <5 %. These values fall within acceptable limits for tsunami modeling and are consistent with the adapted two-layer model previously applied to the 2018 Palu landslide tsunami (Pakoksung et al., 2019). Open boundaries at the bay mouth were preserved with an artificial wave reflection. Additionally, wet/dry front treatment was implemented in the coastal areas to realistically simulate shoreline movement and inundation behavior (Imamura, 1995). The simulation was run in 5 h of physical time, and results included water surface elevation and time series of water level at virtual tide gauges.
The two-layer model is represented by a non-dispersive long-wave approximation, which might underrepresent higher-mode oscillations. However, the dominant resonance periods of Ambon Bay are principally governed by bay geometry, which the model determinations effectively. Future studies should apply dispersive or non-hydrostatic models for improved accuracy in capturing short-period dynamics. Bottom friction coefficients were used for the landslide body and for tsunami propagation in water, reflecting their different resistance forces. This clarification improves transparency in parameterization.
Although the two-layer model used in this study has been validated in the previous research in contradiction of the 2018 Palu Bay and the 2018 Anak Krakatau tsunamis (Pakoksung et al., 2019, 2020), this study adopted the model in a scenario-based method for Ambon Bay without direct validation from local events. The accuracy of the adopted model was assessed using the performance indices 
 (geometric mean ratio) and 
 (geometric standard deviation), following Aida (1978), Pakoksung et al. (2019, 2020). An acceptable tsunami model corresponds to a geometric mean ratio 
 between 0.95 and 1.05, and a geometric standard deviation 
 less than 1.45, where 
 and 
 are used to evaluate the agreement between observed and simulated maximum wave heights (JSCE, 2002). For the Palu tsunami case, the model produced 
 and 
, which marginally exceeds the acceptable range, suggesting moderate agreement. However, for the Anak Krakatau tsunami, the values of 
 and 
 clearly located outside the acceptable limits, indicating limited model accuracy.
2.4. Spectral analysis
To investigate the frequency-dependent behavior of tsunami and identify resonant oscillation patterns along the Ambon Bay coastline, we conducted a spectral analysis based on the simulated tsunami waveforms, following Catalán et al. (2015) and Ren et al. (2022). This analysis employs the FFT technique, implemented via the NumPy library in Python, as described by Harris et al. (2020). FFT is a well-established tool for transforming time-domain tsunami signals into their frequency-domain representations, letting the extraction of dominant periods and amplitudes. This method has been widely used in tsunami studies, including those by Munger and Cheung (2008), Roeber et al. (2010), Yamazaki and Cheung (2011), Heidarzadeh and Satake (2013), Pakoksung et al. (2022, 2023), and Wang et al. (2022a).
In this study, we analyzed 3-h time series data following the simulated landslide event. Virtual tide gauges were positioned at 100-m intervals along the coastline to record water surface elevations. A Hovmöller diagram originally introduced by Ernest Hovmöller (1949) for atmospheric wave studies was used to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of tsunami wave amplitudes (Melgar and Ruiz-Angulo, 2018). In the diagram, the horizontal axis represents the distance along the shoreline, and the vertical axis shows time, enabling clear identification of wave reflections, edge waves, and standing wave patterns.
Spectral analysis was conducted on the time series extracted from each virtual tide gauge. The FFT method was applied to compute the power spectral density (PSD), which quantifies the average power distribution of the tsunami signal across frequency bands. The PSD was estimated by squaring the FFT amplitude, in line with standard signal processing practices (DEMPSTER, 2000). The FFT coefficient corresponding (
) to frequency index 
 of a time series signal 
 of length 
 is followed by:
(7)
The power spectral density (PSD) is estimated as:
(8)
where 
 is the sampling interval in second. The PSD calculates the distribution of tsunami signal energy across frequency bands.
To identify spatial and frequency-domain characteristics, spectral plots were generated to show the relationship between period and amplitude, as well as between period and phase angle. The amplitude spectrum reveals the magnitude of energy associated with each wave period, while the phase spectrum provides information on the phase shift of wave components relative to a cosine reference waveform (Randall, 2000). By examining these spectra, we identified the dominant oscillation periods along different sections of the Ambon Bay shoreline and calculated the spatial peak period—the wave period corresponding to the highest spectral amplitude. The results of this analysis are shown in Section 3.3 (see Fig. 12, Fig. 13). This analysis enabled to assess localized resonance effects and energy amplification patterns critical to understanding tsunami impact zones.
Recent advances in tsunami spectral analysis, including applications of FFT and wavelet transforms, have demonstrated their practicality for undertaking both temporal and frequency-dependent tsunami characteristics (Wang et al., 2022b, 2025). These approaches provide complementary insights interested in resonance and energy distribution.
In addition to the FFT and PSD analysis, the natural resonance period of Ambon Bay was estimated using the empirical formula (Rabinovich, 2010; Ivanov et al., 2018; Pakoksung et al., 2023a, Pakoksung et al., 2023b):

where 
 is the length of the bay is measured in the direction perpendicular to the bay entrance and 
 is the width of the bay parallel to the entrance. 
 is the average water depth in the bay. In this study, the fundamental mode was considered with 
 and 
. Applying this method for the Ambon Bay shape with 
 km and 
 m, the natural resonant period of Ambon Bay was calculated as approximately 23 min.
3. Results
3.1. Submarine landslide scenario
The results of this study suggest that the tsunami in the Ambon Bay may have been initiated by a submarine landslide, triggered by significant sediment displacement along the upper submarine slope. The instability of this slope is identified as the most possible mechanism behind the failure, resulting in the formation of a seafloor landslide deposit and subsequent tsunami wave generation affecting the coastal areas.
To evaluate slope instability, a spatial distribution of the safety factor was computed using the SHALSTAB model. Areas with safety factors 
 less than 1 were classified as potentially unstable as presented in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the safety factor values across the study area range from 0.7 to 1.2. The most critical zones—where failure is most probable—are located along the middle section of the northern shoreline. The associated histogram in Fig. 3b indicates that most safety factors are concentrated between 0.95 and 1.05, with a skew toward marginal instability, highlighting the likelihood of slope failure under dynamic or external loading conditions.
Further analysis was performed to estimate the landslide depth distribution (Fig. 4) based on the soil thickness parameter 
 in areas where the computed safety factor (
) was less than 1.0, indicating potential instability. In this approach, it assumed that unstable slopes could experience full-depth failure, representing a conservative worst-case scenario. As shown in Fig. 4a, the predicted landslide source is placed in the middle northern section of the Ambon Bay, corresponding to zones with the lowest safety factors. The probability histogram in Fig. 4b indicates that most estimated landslide depths is approximately within 40–45 m, while the overall depth distribution ranges from 1 to 50 m, consistent with the soil thickness values applied in the slope stability model.

This scenario analysis presents a conservative estimate, assuming full-depth slope failure across all unstable areas. While idealized, it provides a critical framework for assessing the upper-bound tsunami hazard that could be generated by submarine landslides in the Ambon Bay. These findings were used as the basis for tsunami propagation simulations discussed in the following section.
3.2. Tsunami wave generation and propagation
In the model, the upper layer represented seawater with a constant density of 
, and the lower layer represented the fluidized sediment, modeled with a grain density 
 and porosity 
 (see Section 2.3 for parameter explanation).
The landslide source consists of two distinct failure zones identified from the slope-stability analysis (
), located along the central submarine slope and near the bay mouth (Fig. 4). The estimated displaced sediment volumes are approximately 0.063 km3 and 0.007 km3, respectively. Both failure zones were assumed to collapse simultaneously to represent a conservative scenario. Landslide motion begins at t = 0 s and continues for approximately 60–120 s, moving downslope toward the bay axis following local bathymetric gradients. This deformation of the seabed displaces the overlying water column, producing uplift near the slide toe and depression near its head, which together generate the initial tsunami wave. Fig. 5 shows the time evolution of this process at t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 s. A solitary-type leading wave is formed and propagates predominantly eastward along the bay axis. Between 5 and 15 s, both failure zones generate outward-propagating wave fronts, with stronger amplitudes toward the eastern and northern parts of the bay. By t = 30–60 s, the sliding mass stabilizes at a slope of approximately 5°, after which tsunami wave propagation becomes the dominant process. The maximum wave amplitudes during generation reach approximately 10–30 m.

Fig. 6 shows the maximum water levels across Ambon Bay from the single worst-case landslide simulation, which assumes simultaneous failure of unstable slopes identified in the stability analysis. The results show asymmetrical wave impact patterns, with higher water levels recorded along the southern coastline. Within this region, the western section experiences greater water elevation than the east, attributed to deeper bathymetric features that direct and amplify incoming waves through refraction and channeling effects. The top panel presents the maximum water levels along the northern coastline. While the northern coast is closer to the landslide source, it generally shows reasonable tsunami heights, expected due to the steep bathymetric slope that causes waves to propagate offshore more efficiently. The observed pattern is relatively uniform, with only minor fluctuations in wave elevation. In contrast, the bottom panel shows a more complex pattern along the southern coastline, which experiences significantly higher wave amplitudes, particularly in its western portion. This amplification can be attributed to the deeper and more irregular underwater topography in that area, which presents wave refraction and potential resonance. As waves interact with the curved in shoreline and seabed gradient, energy becomes trapped and redirected, rising water levels before landfall.

The top and bottom panels present the graph of maximum water levels recorded at the virtual tide gauges (see Fig. 1c), corresponding to gauges located along the coastline in the northern and southern regions, respectively. The results indicate higher wave amplitudes concentrated along the western shorelines. The map in the center was created using QGIS software version 3.34.7-Prizren (http://www.qgis.org). The basemap was collected from QuickMapServices (https://github.com/nextgis/quickmapservices).

Fig. 7 presents the distribution of tsunami arrival times along the Ambon Bay coastline. The results show a separate temporal asymmetry between the northern and southern shores. Along the northern coast—closer to the landslide source—tsunami arrive within approximately 1.5 min, with the latest arrivals occurring at approximately 20 min. In contrast, the southern coastline experiences a broader range of arrival times, from about 1 min near the landslide front to 25 min in the southeastern extents of the bay. These variations are primarily influenced by the location of the landslide, coastal bathymetry, and the varying propagation direction of tsunami and refract across a complex geometry of the bay. The top panel plots the arrival time profile along the northern coastline, presenting a relatively sharp increase in arrival time with distance from the source. At the same time, the bottom panel, representing the southern coastline, shows a more gradual and variable increase, reflecting the influence of wave path curvature, bottom friction, and shallow bathymetry within the bay.

Fig. 8 presents the distribution of tsunami inundation depth along the shoreline of the Ambon Bay, resulting from simulations based on multiple potential submarine landslide scenarios. Fig. 8a shows the spatial map that the northern shoreline experiences the most extensive inundation, with depths reaching up to 3 m across an estimated 5.0 km2 of affected land. This can be attributed to its relative proximity to the source and its curve in coastal shape, which enhances wave convergence and run-up. The southern coastline similarly demonstrates notable inundation, particularly in the western area, where tsunami runup inland with depths reaching approximately 10 m. In contrast, the eastern area of the southern coast is represented by shallower inundation depths, generally ranging between 1 and 3 m, due to milder slopes and a more diffuse wave impact pattern. Fig. 8b presents the accompanying histogram quantifies the distribution of inundation depths, showing a high frequency of shallow flooding and indicating the presence of localized zones with significantly deeper spreads. These spatial differences in inundation are closely related to variations in nearshore bathymetry, slope gradients, and the geometry of the coastline.

The tsunami simulations clearly demonstrate that submarine landslides in the Ambon Bay can generate high-energy waves with significant coastal impacts. The results reveal spatial variability in wave amplitude, arrival time, and inundation depth, largely influenced by the landslide location and underlying bathymetry. To further understand the wave behavior beyond initial propagation—particularly the frequency characteristics, resonance patterns, and energy distribution along the coastline—a detailed spectral analysis was conducted and is presented in the following section.
3.3. Spectral analysis of the tsunami
To investigate the frequency characteristics and resonance behavior of tsunami in Ambon Bay, we performed a spectral analysis on the simulated waveforms generated by the two-layer numerical model. The FFT analysis produced spectral amplitudes as a function of frequency (or period), enabling the identification of dominant oscillation modes, energy distribution patterns, and spatial variability in wave behavior. While FFT is widely used and effective in identifying dominant frequencies, it is limited in capturing the nonlinear and non-stationary nature of landslide-generated tsunamis (Constance and Heller, 2022). More advanced techniques such as the Wavelet Transform, wavenumber–frequency spectral density analysis (Romano et al., 2013), or nonlinear Fourier transforms (Brühl et al., 2022; Heller and Ruffini, 2023) may better reflect the underlying physics. These approaches are recommended for future investigation to enhance spectral characterization of such complex wave phenomena.
To explain the temporal evolution of tsunami oscillations, we first extracted waveforms at the virtual tide gauges located along the bay mouth as shown the gauge's location in Fig. 1. Fig. 9 resulted in the time series of oscillation amplitudes increase toward the bay, and repeated wave amplification continues over several cycles, consistent with resonance behavior.

To further examine the spatial and temporal evolution of tsunami wave behavior along the Ambon Bay coastline, we employed a Hovmöller diagram as presented in Fig. 10. This diagram visualizes the wave amplitudes recorded by virtual tide gauges positioned at 100-m (0.1 km) intervals along approximately 70 km of the Ambon Bay shoreline, as indicated by the blue line in Fig. 1c. In total, approximately 700-gauge locations were used to illustrate the Hovmöller diagram. The horizontal axis represents distance along the coastline, while the vertical axis corresponds to elapsed simulation time, capturing tsunami oscillations over a 3-h period. Together, the time series and the Hovmöller diagram provide complementary insights into the resonance characteristics of Ambon Bay.

The horizontal axis represents the distance along the coast, while the vertical axis denotes elapsed time. Distinct wave reflections and edge wave patterns able to observe, approximately 10 km and 50 km.

As shown in Fig. 10, the analysis revealed that the most prominent tsunami activity occurred within the 0–20 km and 40–70 km segments of the Ambon Bay coastline. These zones exhibited strong and persistent oscillations, indicating prolonged wave activity and potential resonance effects. Distinctive wave reflections appeared near the 10 km and 50 km coastal segments, indicated by repeated or intersecting wave patterns in the Hovmöller diagram. These reflections indicate that waves were bouncing off coastal boundaries or bathymetric features, contributing to constructive interference.
In addition, the diagram displays evidence of edge waves—low-frequency gravity waves trapped near the shore due to coastal refraction (Ursell, 1952; Heller and Ruffini, 2023). These edge waves, particularly noticeable at the similar 10 km and 50 km locations, appeared intertwined with shelf resonance phenomena. The combination of edge wave trapping and local resonant modes contributed to the extended tsunami duration in these areas. This behavior highlights the importance of nearshore geometry and bathymetric variation in modifying tsunami energy and determination along the Ambon Bay coastline.
Fig. 11 presents the results of the power spectral density (PSD) analysis conducted along the Ambon Bay coastline using data from all virtual tide gauges. This analysis provided detailed insights into the frequency characteristics of the tsunami wave and the influence of wave reflections and edge waves on localized energy amplification. Fig. 11a explains the spatial distribution of PSD values along the coast, highlighting areas of high spectral intensity. The strongest energy concentrations are observed in specific coastal segments, correlating with previously identified zones of wave reflection and prolonged tsunami duration.

Higher peak periods (up to ∼12 min) appear in shallower eastern and northern regions of Ambon Bay, indicating localized resonance effects.

Our analysis identified six dominant oscillation modes, with peak energy levels centered around periods of 5 min 13 s, 4 min 36 s, 3 min 45 s, 2 min 40 s, 2 min 15 s, and 1 min 41 s, as shown in Fig. 11b. These modes represent key resonant frequencies that were excited by the interaction between the external tsunami and the Ambon Bay with a complex coastal geometry. Notably, energy in the shallow central regions of the bay was predominantly associated with longer periods (>5 min), suggesting basin-wide resonance. In contrast, the deeper offshore areas exhibited a broader spectrum, with both high- and low-frequency components present near the boundaries of the domain, particularly at the start and end of the coastline.
Fig. 12 presents the spatial structure of six dominant oscillation modes identified from the spectral analysis. The first column (Fig. 12 a1–f1) explains the spectral amplitude distributions for each mode across the Ambon Bay. These maps reveal the intensity and spatial reach of each resonant frequency, providing insight into how tsunami energy is distributed throughout the bay. Despite the tsunami originating from the southwest, the energy patterns are shown to be relatively uniform across both northern and southern shorelines, indicating widespread resonance effects rather than directional concentration.
The second column (Fig. 12 a2–f2) presents the phase angle distributions associated with each oscillation mode. These phase maps offer critical insight into the wave structure—whether the modes exhibit standing or progressive wave characteristics. In several cases, the phase plots display steady, continuous changes rather than rapid shifts, indicating the presence of partial standing waves. This behavior results from Ambon Bay with irregular coastal geometry, which disrupts the formation of typical standing wave nodes and antinodes. In contrast, progressive wave patterns are identified in regions where the phase varies uniformly without reversal, highlighting the coexistence of different wave pattern within the bay.
Collectively, the spectral amplitude and phase plots in Fig. 12 provide a detailed understanding of how tsunami resonates within the Ambon Bay with complex bathymetric and coastal framework. These results assistance identify zones of energy concentration and clarify the interplay between standing and progressive wave behavior.
Fig. 13 provides a comprehensive overview of the spatial distribution of spectral energy and peak periods, offering further insight into the resonance behavior of tsunami in the Ambon Bay. Fig. 13a shows the total spectral energy, highlighting regions most vulnerable to strong oscillations. Areas with energy values exceeding 90 cm2 s are primarily concentrated along the northern and southern coastlines on the western side of the bay. These zones correspond to regions where resonance modes constructively amplify wave motion, increasing the potential for coastal impact. Additionally, elevated spectral energy is similarly observed in portions of the central bay, particularly near the submarine landslide source area, suggesting that localized bathymetric disturbances contribute significantly to energy accumulation. The peak periods were identified using a spatio-temporal Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to the simulated water surface elevation across both time and space. Fig. 13b presents the spatial variation of the peak period, the period associated with the highest spectral amplitude at each coastal point. The results indicate that peak periods vary between 4 and 14 min, with the longest periods (up to 14 min) concentrated in the eastern and northern regions of the Ambon Bay. These longer-period oscillations are attributed to the shallower bathymetry in these regions, which slows wave propagation and enhances resonance. This spatial variation in peak period is critical for identifying areas vulnerable to continued tsunami activity and potential amplification.
The theoretical natural oscillation period of Ambon Bay is approximately 23 min, based on the empirical formula (Rabinovich, 2010; Ivanov et al., 2018; Pakoksung et al., 2023a, Pakoksung et al., 2023b). However, spectral analysis of the simulated landslide-generated tsunami (Fig. 13b) shows a dominant peak period of approximately 14 min, indicating that realistic bathymetry and the narrowing bay geometry modify the fundamental resonance. In contrast, the shorter oscillations observed in Fig. 11 (1.7–5.2 min) represent local higher-order modes along the shoreline rather than the bay-wide resonance.
A sensitivity was conducted to examine the influence of landslide rheology and boundary conditions on tsunami response. Variations in sediment rheology such as friction angle, basal friction produced modest changes in maximum wave amplitude without the change in dominant resonance periods. This finding is consistent with recent sensitivity studies of landslide-tsunami models (Romano et al., 2020; Marbœuf et al., 2025), which showed that the rheology affects amplitude, resonance characteristics are primarily governed by basin geometry. In addition, the non-reflective open-sea boundary condition presented a result that showed minimal artificial wave return, confirming that the boundary treatment effectively blocked reflections.
4. Discussion
This study provides a complete investigation of tsunami hazards in the Ambon Bay, Indonesia, through an integrated approach combining slope stability modeling, two-layer tsunami wave simulation, and frequency-domain spectral analysis. The results confirm the vulnerability of the region to submarine landslide-induced tsunamis and reveal complex wave dynamics shaped by bathymetry and coastal geometry. These findings align with and build upon previous research on tsunami generation and resonance in enclosed or semi-enclosed basins.
4.1. Submarine landslide scenario
The slope stability analysis conducted using the SHALSTAB model identified regions within the Ambon Bay that are vulnerable to submarine slope failure, particularly along the northern coastal segment. These findings suggest that landslide-triggered tsunamis are a reasonable hazard in this area, especially given the steep underwater slopes of bay and moveable sediment composition. Although historical records do not confirm a submarine landslide-induced tsunami in the Ambon Bay, similar tectonically active regions in Indonesia, such as Flores in 1992, Papua New Guinea in 1998 and Palu Bay in 2018, have experienced destructive tsunamis from comparable submarine mass failures (Imamura et al., 1995; Tappin et al., 2001; Pakoksung et al., 2019). These parallels underscore the importance of investigating submarine slope instability in tsunami possible settings, even in the absence of direct historical precedent.
4.2. Tsunami wave generation and propagation
To simulate tsunami generation and propagation, this study employed a two-layer numerical model able of representing both water and sediment dynamics. Although the model has not been directly validated against a historical event in the Ambon Bay, its application in past events offers strong reliability. Specifically, the similar two-layer model has been successfully applied to simulate the 2018 Palu Bay tsunami and the 2018 Anak Krakatau tsunami, both of which involved submarine landslides and complex coastal geometries. In those cases, the model produced results with suitable agreement to observed tide gauge records and run-up data, as reported by Pakoksung et al. (2019, 2020), Lahcene et al. (2021), and Somphong et al. (2022).
Significantly, the model conformation used in the Ambon Bay was identical to that used for Palu Bay, and the bathymetric profiles of both bays are notably similar—narrow, enclosed, and deep—making the model suitable for simulating tsunami behavior in the Ambon Bay. Despite the lack of direct observational validation for the Ambon Bay, the prior accuracy of model in similar settings supports its use for forecasting reasonable tsunami impacts, including maximum wave heights up to 30 m and inundation depths exceeding 10 m along vulnerable shorelines.
Fig. 6, Fig. 7 provide a first-order indication of tsunami amplification patterns in Ambon Bay. They should not be interpreted as final inundation maps, as detailed inundation analysis requires higher-resolution (5 or 10 m) nearshore topography. Instead, these figures highlight relative hazard hotspots that can guide further site-specific investigations.
The Ambon Bay scenario shows typical characteristics compared with other Indonesian tsunamis. The Palu Bay tsunami in 2018 was generated by strike-slip faults associated by submarine landslides in a narrow and extended bay, leading to solid amplification along the bay (Pakoksung et al., 2019). In contrast, the Anak Krakatau tsunami in 2018 caused a volcanic flank collapse, producing extremely asymmetric waves that propagated across the Sunda Strait (Pakoksung et al., 2020; Muhari et al., 2019). In Ambon Bay, the submarine landslide source generates shorter-period oscillations and pronounced resonance effects due to the semi-enclosed, curved geometry of the bay. This comparison highlights that tsunami characteristics are shaped by both the triggering mechanism and the coastal basin morphology.
It should be noted that this study does not directly re-analyze the 2018 Palu or Anak Krakatau events, the previous studies have already validated the two-layer model against those observations. This study confirms that the present scenario-based analysis of Ambon Bay is grounded in a modeling framework that has been demonstrated to capture the dynamics of real-world landslide-induced tsunamis. The results presented in this study are derived from a single conservative scenario assuming simultaneous failure of unstable slopes. This provides a first-order exploration of potential tsunami hazards in Ambon Bay. While amplitudes vary under different parameter settings or partial-failure scenarios, the tests confirm that the dominant resonance period remains consistent. Future studies should incorporate multiple earthquake-triggered or progressive-failure scenarios to better constrain hazard ranges.
4.3. Spectral analysis and resonance behavior
The frequency-domain analysis provided additional insight into how tsunami energy is distributed and resonates within the Ambon Bay. The use of the FFT revealed six dominant oscillation periods ranging from approximately 1.7 to 5.2 min, which correspond to resonance modes excited by the geometry of the bay. These findings align with previous spectral studies of tsunami resonance in enclosed procedures of water, such as Piru Bay (Pakoksung et al., 2023a, Pakoksung et al., 2023b), Pago Pago Harbor (Roeber et al., 2010), and Quarry Bay (Ren et al., 2022).
The Hovmöller diagram and power spectral density maps confirmed the occurrence of wave reflections and edge wave formations, particularly approximately 10 km and 50 km along the coastline, areas that similarly corresponded to zones of continued wave activity. Additionally, peak spectral energy was concentrated in the west of the bay, with peak periods reaching 14 min in shallow regions of the east and north, pointing to strong shelf resonance and energy trapping in those areas. These patterns emphasize the importance of coastal morphology in modulating tsunami wave behavior and highlight specific locations within the Ambon Bay that may be at elevated risk during future tsunami events.
The comparison between theoretical and simulated resonance highlights the importance of both basin-scale geometry and local bathymetric effects. The theoretical fundamental natural oscillation period of Ambon Bay is approximately 23 min; however, the dominant modeled peak period of approximately 14 min (Fig. 13b) reflects a bathymetrically modified resonance mode that is dynamically excited by the landslide-generated tsunami. In contrast, the shorter oscillations of 1.7–5.2 min observed in Fig. 11 correspond to local higher-order modes produced by shallow nearshore areas and cannot be interpreted as the principal bay-wide resonance. These findings demonstrate that while the overall bay geometry governs the fundamental resonance, local bathymetric variations generate additional shorter-period oscillations.
4.4. Limitations of this study
This study contributes valuable understanding of tsunami risks in Ambon Bay; however, it has certain limitations, as outlined below. First, due to the lack of historical landslide-generated tsunami events in the Ambon Bay, the simulation results cannot be validated with observational data from the area. Even though Ambon Bay has no record of large submarine landslides, similar upper-slope failures have been observed in other Indonesian bays, particularly when triggered by strong earthquake shaking. This study could support the reasonableness of significant sediment displacement along the upper submarine slope as a potential tsunami source. Second, the landslide parameters used in the modeling are based on scenario assumptions from slope stability outputs and may not fully reflect real-time dynamic triggers, such as earthquake ground motion or rapid sediment loading. The scenarios presented in this study are conservative, assuming concurrent full-depth failure of identified unstable zones. Other scenarios, such as partial or deeper slope failures, could produce different amplitudes and waveforms. Nevertheless, because resonance characteristics are fundamentally controlled by the geometry of the bay, the dominant frequency content is expected to remain similar across a range of probable landslide scenarios. A limitation is that a full grid/time-step convergence test was not performed. However, prior validated studies using the same numerical settings and the present stability/conservation checks provide confidence in the robustness of our results. Although no additional convergence tests were performed, the consistently low Courant numbers and small conservation errors (<5 %) support the reliability of the numerical scheme.
Third, the spectral analysis employed the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which assumes linear, stationary wave behavior. This method may not adequately capture the nonlinear and transient characteristics of landslide-generated tsunamis, which are typically composed of complex, non-sinusoidal waveforms (Constance and Heller, 2022). More advanced techniques—such as wavelet transforms, nonlinear spectral methods, or wavenumber–frequency analyses—may provide more accurate representations and are recommended for future research. Finally, sediment rheology and material deformation during landslides are simplified in the two-layer model, which could affect the accuracy of initial wave generation.
A limited sensitivity analysis was conducted of which indicate that resonance periods are robust to variations in slide rheology and that the adopted boundary conditions do not introduce significant reflection. More extensive parameter exploration is recommended for future studies.
5. Conclusion
This study assessed the tsunami hazard in the Ambon Bay, Indonesia, by integrating submarine landslide scenario analysis, two-layer numerical tsunami modeling, and spectral analysis of wave behavior. Using detailed bathymetric and topographic data, slope instability was evaluated through the SHALSTAB model, revealing that confident underwater slopes in the northern bay exhibit safety factors below 1—indicating a high vulnerability to failure. Whereas previous studies have mainly focused on earthquake-generated tsunamis, this study investigates how submarine landslide tsunamis can induce resonance in Ambon Bay. Identifying the resonant periods of the bay is essential for understanding how tsunami waves may be amplified; resonance-driven oscillations can increase wave heights and prolong inundation even when the initial tsunami is moderate, making resonance a critical factor in hazard assessment for semi-enclosed basins. By integrating slope-stability analysis, two-layer tsunami modeling, and spectral analysis, this study provides a methodological framework for assessing landslide-induced resonance effects that can be adapted to other bays with similar geomorphological characteristics.
Overall, this study demonstrates that Ambon Bay is potentially vulnerable to damaging landslide-generated tsunamis under specific slope failure scenarios. The applied modeling approach offers a valuable tool for predicting tsunami impacts and supports early warning and coastal planning imaginations in Eastern Indonesia. Continued monitoring, high-resolution subsurface mapping, and the inclusion of seismic triggering mechanisms in future models are recommended to enhance tsunami risk mitigation strategies in this geologically active region.
