Abstract
In the twin-roll strip casting process, high-temperature molten metal solidifies upon contact with casting rolls, leading to complex heat transfer during solidification. However, few studies have simultaneously addressed the solidification heat transfer and wettability of copper alloys. This study experimentally investigates the interfacial heat transfer behavior of the Cu-9Ni-6Sn alloy under varying coating thickness and surface roughness. Temperature evolution profiles were obtained to characterize heat transfer performance under different substrate conditions. Numerical simulations were further employed to validate the experimental temperature curves and to further examine the wettability and spreading behavior of copper alloy droplets during solidification on metal substrates, confirming the robustness of the computational model. The results indicate that the copper substrate, due to its high thermal conductivity, exhibits faster heating and cooling rates and maintains lower temperatures compared to a steel substrate. Increasing the coating thickness reduces heat transfer efficiency, however, the combined effects of interfacial thermal resistance and coating thermal resistance diminish the marginal gains in thermal insulation. Furthermore, increasing substrate surface roughness impedes liquid alloy flow due to microscale asperities, promoting the formation of localized eddy currents and stagnation zones that enhance heat accumulation and localized heat transfer to the substrate. Simulations further reveal that the number of secondary droplets formed during splashing is lower on steel substrates than on copper substrates, and the droplet spreading distance increases with impact velocity within the range of 0∼0.3 m/s. These findings provide valuable insights into the heat transfer and solidification mechanisms of copper alloys during twin-roll strip casting.

1. Introduction
Cu-9Ni-6Sn alloy is widely used in high-tech fields such as precision electronic devices and aerospace connectors due to its high strength, excellent wear resistance, and corrosion resistance [1,2]. However, a major limitation of conventional casting lies in the strong tendency of Sn to undergo dendritic segregation, leading to pronounced microstructural and property inhomogeneities. This inherent issue necessitates subsequent processing steps, such as rolling and heat treatment, thereby increasing both the complexity and cost of the overall manufacturing process [3]. Twin-roll casting (TRC) technology produces thin strips directly from the melt via rapid solidification, thereby effectively suppressing elemental segregation and refining the microstructure. This makes TRC a promising solution to the aforementioned issues. However, the solidification and heat transfer behavior of Cu-9Ni-6Sn alloy in the TRC process is still unclear, which restricts process optimization and performance control.
Based on the physical state and contact behavior of the molten metal, the interface between the molten pool and the casting roll can be categorized into four distinct regions: the liquid-contact zone, the phase transition zone, the shrinkage zone, and the rolling zone [4]. Throughout the contact process, the interfacial heat transfer between the metal melt and the casting rolls in the twin-roll strip casting molten pool is accompanied by complex flow and phase transformation [5]. The average interfacial heat transfer coefficient is governed by a multitude of factors, including the casting material, pouring temperature, casting speed, molten pool height, roll material, coating thickness, roll surface roughness, casting force, and roll geometry [6].
Pioneering experimental investigations have established the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing solidification heat transfer. Tavares et al. [7,8] investigated the evolution of interfacial heat flux during the solidification of carbon steel using a twin-roll casting simulator, and examined the influence of strip thickness and pouring speed. Coates and Argyropoulos [9] reported that increasing surface roughness reduces the heat transfer coefficient at the metal/mold interface, whereas higher liquid metal temperatures enhance the heat transfer coefficient. Strezov [10] developed a custom experimental setup employing stainless steel as the melt and copper as the cooling substrate, simulating interfacial heat transfer and solidification in TRC. Xue et al. [11] proposed a three-dimensional numerical model incorporating surface roughness, substrate thermal properties, and contact pressure. Their results demonstrated that the local cooling gradient of impacting droplets governs solidification, droplet coalescence, and dendrite refinement.
The wettability of a material, which characterizes the spreading dynamics of molten metal droplets on a substrate, is another critical factor. Worthington pioneered the study of droplet impact dynamics, including surface deformation, energy dissipation, and splash behavior, laying the foundation for understanding and controlling droplet-substrate interactions. Subsequent studies revealed that droplet spreading and splashing depend on multiple factors, including droplet physical properties, substrate characteristics, and impact velocity [12,13]. Unlike simple liquid droplet impacts on solid surfaces [[14], [15], [16], [17]], molten metal droplets often undergo non-isothermal solidification during impact, involving complex thermodynamic phase transformations that are difficult to observe experimentally [18], consequently, numerical simulations have become an important tool. Zhang et al. [19]. showed via simulation that increasing superheat enhances substrate melting and droplet spreading, while insufficient superheat promotes premature solidification and splashing. They further proposed a simplified relation between the maximum spreading factor and Reynolds number, and emphasized the role of interfacial thermal resistance. Ma et al. [20]. studied droplet impacts of boron, gallium, and aluminum using numerical methods, concluding that droplet kinetic energy is the dominant factor determining impact outcomes. The twin-roll casting process inherently involves a complex multiphysics coupling among fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification. Recent studies have shown that the flow-field distribution within the melt pool exerts a decisive influence on the temperature field and the resulting solidification behavior. For example, Zhang et al. [21] revealed through numerical simulations that the vortex structures generated during pouring markedly influence the uniformity of solidification shell growth. In parallel, the application of external fields (e.g., electric fields) has been shown to effectively regulate this process. Zhang et al. [2] showed that the Joule heating and electromagnetic forces generated by electric fields can modify temperature gradients and enhance melt convection, thereby refining grain size and improving interfacial bonding. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of the coupled temperature and flow fields is essential for achieving a deeper understanding of the solidification heat-transfer mechanisms in twin-roll casting.
A review of the existing literature reveals that most studies on alloy solidification in TRC processes have predominantly concentrated on either heat-transfer behavior or interfacial wettability, with relatively few addressing the coupled effects between them. Furthermore, integrated experimental and numerical investigations specifically focused on copper alloys remain limited. Therefore, building upon previous research, this study develops a coupled fluid-thermal model to elucidate the interfacial heat transfer mechanisms of molten copper alloys during the twin-roll casting process. By combining experiments and numerical simulations, the effects of surface roughness, coating thickness [22], and wettability on thermal conduction and droplet spreading are systematically investigated. This research is expected to provide theoretical guidance for optimizing thermal management and enhancing solidification stability in the TRC of copper alloys. In addition, it aims to deliver practical process-optimization strategies, offering valuable insights for the production of high-performance, cost-efficient Cu-9Ni-6Sn alloy components for electronic and aerospace applications.

2.3. Experimental methods
The experimental setup employed K-type thermocouples to monitor real-time temperature variations at three locations (P1, P2, and P3) positioned at the center of the substrate. Each thermocouple was inserted into a pre-drilled hole in the substrate, and any gaps were filled with high-temperature adhesive to ensure secure fixation and minimize thermal resistance. Experiments were initiated only after the thermocouples were firmly installed. A rod-shaped copper alloy sample with a diameter of 2 mm was charged into a crucible and melted using an electromagnetic induction heating furnace operated at a power of 2900 W. The heating duration was maintained at 5 min per cycle, and the melt temperature was monitored in situ with a thermocouple until it reached 900 °C, ensuring complete liquefaction. The molten copper alloy was then poured onto the substrate surface. To control the volume of the poured melt, a ring with an inner diameter of 14 mm was fixed concentrically above the substrate. A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. During the experiment, temperature data from the thermocouples were recorded using a data acquisition unit at a sampling interval of 0.1 s. The collected data were stored on an SD card and subsequently transferred to a computer for further analysis [23].

In this paper, a 3D stereo model is built using SOLIDWORKS software to simulate the droplets falling onto a solid surface. Fig. 4 shows the model, with a cube of 100 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm in the liquid domain, and a cylinder of 80 mm and 40 mm in the solid domain consistent with the experimental substrate. The upper surface of the fluid domain is set to inlet, and the upper surface of the cylindrical substrate is set to wall-top, coupling the wall with the fluid domain [24]. The bottom face is set to the wall boundary with a no slip boundary condition. The heat transfer process was simplified to account only for conduction and convection, while thermal radiation and droplet surface evaporation were neglected. Regarding boundary conditions, the temperatures of the droplet, the wall, and the ambient air were all prescribed as fixed values. Set the gravity to 9.8 m/s2 and the direction is vertically down along the Y axis. The picture shows meshing, adopted, with a total of 7173394 elements.

The fall of copper alloy droplets on the substrate involves the flow and deformation of the gas-liquid interface, for which the VOF method in ANSYS Fluent was used to capture the change process at the gas-liquid interface. The discrete format is implicit, and the volumetric force format is implicit. To improve computational accuracy, convergence, and stability at the interface of incompressible two-phase flows, an implicit discretization scheme is employed for the governing equations, together with an implicit treatment of volumetric force term in the momentum equation. The solidification of the copper alloy droplets and the heat transfer between the substrate are also involved in the falling process, and the solidification/melting equation in ANSYS Fluent is used to calculate the heat transfer and solidification of the droplets. The droplet also involves viscosity, the k-omega model is chosen, the governing equation is discretized by the finite volume method, the pressure and velocity are coupled by the SIMPLEC method, the pressure is solved by the PRESTO method, the VOF equation is solved by the Geometric-Reconstruction Scheme method, the energy and momentum method is used by the Second Order Upwind, and the mesh adaptation is used to refine the droplet, which follows the morphological changes of droplets during the falling process. The ambient air temperature was set to 27 °C, consistent with the substrate temperature under the experimental conditions. The initial liquid temperature was specified as 1000 °C, and gravitational acceleration was taken as 9.81 m/s2. A hybrid initialization method was employed, assuming that the computational domain was initially filled entirely with gas. Only convective heat transfer was considered in the simulation, while radiative heat transfer was neglected. The time step is set to 0.001 s and the number of iterations per time step is 20.

3.3. Grid independence verification and verification of heat transfer temperature curve of copper alloy
In numerical simulations, the sparsity of the computational grid can influence the accuracy of the results; in principle, a higher mesh density generally yields more reliable predictions. To ensure adequate numerical accuracy, simulations of the heat-transfer behavior of copper alloys on the substrate surface were performed using grids of varying densities. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5. As the mesh density increases, the temperature at point P1 on the substrate exhibits a gradual rise. When the total number of cells reaches 7.17 million, this increasing trend stabilizes, indicating that further refinement has a negligible effect on the predicted temperature. To achieve an optimal balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, a mesh density of 7.17 million cells was adopted for the final simulations.

In the process of numerical simulation, the contact thermal resistance of the model during heat transfer will affect the results of the temperature change curve, according to the physical process, theoretically, before the formation of the solidified billet shell, the heat transfer thermal resistance is smaller, after the formation of the billet shell, the heat transfer becomes slower, and the thermal resistance becomes larger. To ensure the reliability for the simulation results, the temperature-time evolution of the copper alloy melt on the steel substrate surface was numerically reproduced for the experimental conditions. Subsequently, the interfacial thermal contact resistance between the molten alloy and the substrate surface during solidification was then determined through an inverse calculation procedure, and the corresponding results shown in Fig. 6 are obtained, the contact thermal resistance is 0 in 0∼5 s, 0.0002 in 5∼8 s, 0.001 in 8∼15s, 0.004 in 15∼25 s, 0.005 in 25∼35 s, 0.01 in 35∼45 s, 0.03 in 45∼50 s, 0.06 in 50∼60 s, 0.08 in 60∼70 s.

Through the comparison results, it can be seen that the numerical simulation method and physical model in this paper can be used to simulate the process of falling copper alloy droplets on the surface of the substrate.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Liquid-solid heat transfer temperature curve
Fig. 7(a) shows the thermal temperature curve of a molten liquid copper alloy on a smooth copper substrate. Upon contact with the substrate surface, the copper alloy rapidly solidified, transferring heat into the substrate. The temperatures recorded at points P1, P2, and P3 increased sharply, reaching a peaking of 190.3 °C at 5.3 s. Therefore, the temperature gradually decreased and converged to nearly identical values after approximately 30 s. Although the overall heat transfer behavior of the copper alloy on the steel substrate is similar to that observed on the copper substrate, the former exhibits a higher peak temperature of 350 °C, as shown in Fig. 7(b). In addition, the rates of temperature rise and fall at positions P2 and P3 are more gradual on the steel substrate.

A comparison of the temperature evolution at point P1 on the steel and copper substrates is shown in Fig. 8(a). On the copper substrate, the temperature increased and decreased rapidly, reaching its peak at 5.3 s. In contrast, the temperature on the steel substrate changes more gradually, attaining its maximum at 9 s. A direct comparison of the heat flux density in Fig. 8(b) further reveals that the rate of heat transfer at the steel-melt interface is markedly higher than that at the copper-melt interface. Furthermore, only a single peak is observed on the steel substrate surface, indicating that heat transfer on the steel substrate occurs at a slower rate and maintains a relatively uniform transfer speed over time.

The steel and copper substrates exhibit distinctly thermal behaviors due to their contrasting thermal conductivities. On the copper substrate, the temperature peaks at 190.3 °C and fluctuates rapidly, reflecting the alloy's efficient heat absorption, conduction, and subsequent dissipation to the surroundings. In contrast, the steel substrate reaches a higher peak temperature of 350 °C and exhibits more gradual temperature variations, consistent with its lower thermal conductivity, which limits the rate of heat transfer and slows heat loss. At the central point P3 in both substrates, temperature changes are gradual and peak value remain low, indicating significant thermal resistance and a long heat transfer path from the surface to the interior. Furthermore, the temperature at the mid-point of the copper substrate stabilizes 30 s faster than that of the steel substrate, indicating more efficient internal heat transfer and lower overall thermal resistance.
4.2. Simulation of solidification process of copper alloys
Fig. 9 shows the volume fraction contour map of the liquid copper alloy during solidification, simulates the solidification process of copper alloy on the surface of a steel substrate, which occurs relatively quickly and can be divided into three stages. Stage 1 (0.1–2 s): At this stage, the melt still contains a significant amount of liquid copper alloy, and its volume fraction decreases from 1 to 0.8. As shown in the figure, the copper alloy begins to solidify upon contact with the substrate surface, with the solidification area first appearing around the molten liquid, particularly where it contacts the substrate. And then the solidification area gradually expands from the periphery towards the center, primarily concentrating near the substrate surface due to the relatively rapid heat exchange between the copper alloy and the substrate, leading to a quicker attainment of solidification conditions. stage 2 (3–6 s): The liquid copper alloy inside the droplet rapidly decreased, with its volume fraction dropping from 0.7 to 0.2. During the period from 3 s to 5 s, the solidification area continues to advance towards the center, and the range of solidification further expands. By 5 s–6 s, the solidification area has significantly extended, indicating that heat continues to transfer from the interior of the alloy to the exterior, allowing more regions to reach the solidification point. Stage 3 (6–8 s): The liquid copper alloy inside the droplet is nearly depleted, with the entire mass having solidified almost completely. Its volume fraction has decreased from 0.2 to 0.06. Till 7 s, only quite small area is not solidified, small, and by 8 s, almost the entire copper alloy has solidified, only left a minimal amount potentially showing signs of incomplete solidification.

Fig. 9. Diagram of the solidification process of a copper alloy on a substrate.

Based on the solidification process demonstrated in the aforementioned simulation, we can base on the expansion of the solidified area during the solidification process, it is inferred that copper alloys primarily solidify in a layer-by-layer manner. Upon contact with the substrate, the molten copper alloy undergoes heat exchange with the substrate and the surrounding atmosphere, leading to the initial formation of a solid layer at the surface. This solidification front then propagates progressively advances inward, eventually leading to the complete solidification of the entire material.
4.3. Influence of different coating thicknesses on heat transfer
Fig. 10(a) presents the temperature evolution during heat transfer of liquid copper alloys on substrates with different coating thicknesses. As the coating thickens, the heat flux from the alloy to the substrate diminishes, leading to a lower maximum temperature at point P1. As Fig. 10(b) shows, the heat flux density curve shows that as the coating thickness increases, the heat flux density decreases, meaning less heat is transferred at point P1. The maximum temperatures recorded at point P1 were 190.3 °C, 167.0 °C, 138.2 °C, and 125.2 °C for coating thicknesses of 0 μm (uncoated), 58 μm, 79 μm, and 125 μm, respectively. The maximum temperature on the substrate surface exhibits an inverse relationship with the coating thickness, where thicker coatings impede heat transfer, leading to a lower substrate temperature. Furthermore, compared to the uncoated substrate, a 58 μm coating reduces the temperature by 23.3 °C. Additional temperature reductions of 28.8 °C and 13.0 °C are observed as the coating thickness increases from 58 μm to 79 μm and from 79 μm to 125 μm, respectively. Notably, further increase in coating thickness beyond this range produce only marginal decreases in the temperature at P1, indicating a saturation in the thermal resistance effectiveness of the coating.

Analysis of the experimental data above indicates that once the coating thickness exceeds a certain threshold, its ability to impede heat conduction begins to plateau. This behavior arises because thermal resistance exists at both the interface between the coating and the substrate, and at the interface between the coating and the liquid copper alloy. When the coating is relatively thin, the effect of the interfacial thermal resistance is minor, primarily due to the thermal resistance of the coating itself. However, as the coating thickness increases, the impact of the interfacial thermal resistance gradually becomes more pronounced. The combined thermal resistance arising from the interface and the coating exhibits diminishing returns. As a result, simply increasing the coating thickness becomes progressively less effective in enhancing the overall heat transfer resistance.
4.4. Effect of different roughness on heat transfer
As the smoothness of the surface increases, the maximum temperature at the substrate surface P1 decreases. As shown in Fig. 11(a), when the maximum profile height Rz is 1.122 μm, the maximum temperature of the substrate rises to 136.5 °C. When Rz is 1.236 μm, the maximum temperature of the substrate surface is 150.0 °C. When Rz is 2.640 μm, the maximum temperature of the substrate surface is 167.0 °C. When Rz is 3.094 μm, the maximum temperature of the substrate surface is 177.0 °C. As shown in the heat flux density curve in Fig. 11(b), an increase in surface roughness corresponds to enhanced heat absorption by the substrate. This demonstrates that a rougher surface promotes more efficient heat transfer, resulting in a higher equilibrium temperature.

Fig. 11. Heat transfer temperature curves and heat flux density variation curves of liquid copper on different coated surfaces (a) Temperature change curve; (b) Heat flux density curve.

Through analysis of experimental data and literature review, we found that increased surface roughness leads to higher heat transfer temperatures in copper alloys. Bouchard et al. also reached similar conclusions in their study. Fig. 12 illustrates contact surfaces with varying Rz values [28]. When copper alloys are heated to molten state, the fluidity of the liquid alloy increases. However, for a given projected area, the actual surface area of a rough interface is greater than that of a smooth interface, and the rough surface partially impedes the flow of the molten metal.

Fig. 12. Schematic diagram of contact on surfaces with different roughness.

Comparing the temperature change curves for different Rz values, as Rz increases from 1.122 μm to 3.094 μm, the peak temperature rises and heating rate accelerates. This behavior arises because higher surface roughness allows molten copper to flow into depressions on the substrate surface. Subsequently, the rough interface impedes the flow of molten copper, resulting in a relatively larger actual contact area. Increased contact between rough peaks leads to heat accumulation and more pathways for heat transfer. However, as Rz continues to increase, as shown in Fig. 12(c) and (d), air gaps form at the interface between the copper alloy and the substrate. These gaps enlarge with increasing Rz, and once Rz reaches 2.640 μm, the high thermal resistance of air becomes the dominant factor, diminishing the influence of contact area on heat transfer. Consequently, for Rz values of 2.640 μm and 3.094 μm, the maximum temperatures reached 167 °C and 177 °C, respectively, with a slower rate of temperature rise.
In summary, interfaces with moderate roughness enhance heat transfer performance by increasing the actual contact area. However, excessive roughness leads to the formation of air gaps, which impede heat transfer and render higher thermal resistance of air the dominant limiting factor. In the experiment, the heat transfer of copper alloy on a rough surface is greater because the liquid copper alloy flows more readily on a smooth surface, allowing its internal heat to disperse more easily during the heat transfer process, thus making it difficult for heat to accumulate in large amounts locally on the substrate surface. In contrast, the asperities of a rough surface disrupt the flow of the molten copper alloy, increasing flow resistance and promoting the formation of vortices and recirculation zones. These regions serve as sites for localized heat accumulation, thereby enhancing heat transfer to the substrate.
4.5. Copper alloy droplet simulation
4.5.1. Droplet fall process on different substrate surfaces
Fig. 13 illustrates the process of a droplet, with a diameter (D) of 3.8 mm, falling on the surfaces of a steel substrate and a copper substrate. The droplet descent can be divided into four stages. stage 1 occurs from 0 s to 0.15 s, during which the droplet is in the spreading phase. At this stage, the droplet gradually makes contact with the substrate surface and begins to spread. The spread length increases as the droplet descends, however, the apex of the droplet's central region remains slightly lower than the surrounding areas, indicating that it has not yet reached the same height as the adjacent central portions. Stage 2 spans from 0.15 s to 0.25 s, where the droplet is in the central falling and spreading phase. At this stage, the highest point of the droplet disappears, and the peripheral portion begins to dip below the center of the droplet, while the droplet continues to spread outward, stage 3 is from 0.25 s to 0.35 s, represents the rebounding stage. At this stage, after reaching its lowest point, the center of the droplet begins to rebound upward under the influence of surface tension, rising once again above the surrounding regions of the droplet. Finally, stage 4 lasting from 0.35 s to 0.5 s, is characterized by the stable oscillation phase. At this stage, the center of the droplet undergoes stable oscillations above and below the droplet's horizontal plane, with no further changes observed.

Fig. 13. The process of droplet impact on different substrate surfaces (a) Steel substrate; (b) Copper substrate.

By comparison, it is found that the number of droplets splattering on the copper substrate surface is greater, and the splattering occurs earlier. Due to the low interfacial energy on the copper alloy substrate surface, there is little difference in energy between the substrate being spread out or gathered by the droplet. The droplet lacks sufficient driving force for spreading. Therefore, upon impact, the droplet's available kinetic energy is predominantly converted into deformation. In the absence of a significant capillary-driven spreading force, the outer layer of the droplet becomes unstable and is more prone to detachment from the bulk, leading to an earlier onset and higher frequency of splashing. On steel substrates, the high interfacial energy generates a repulsive interaction that limits wetting. To minimize the system's total energy, the droplet assumes a flattened, stable morphology by maximizing its contact area with the substrate. This extensive spreading enables efficient dissipation of impact kinetic energy, stabilizing the droplet periphery against instability and rupture, thereby suppressing splattering. Therefore, copper alloys exhibit poor wettability on copper substrates. During the spreading process of copper alloy droplets, some droplets coalesce into smaller droplets and splash off under external disturbance. Consequently, a greater number of splashes occur on copper substrates, and these splashes appear earlier.
4.5.2. Droplet fall at different initial velocities
Fig. 14 illustrates the process of droplets impacting a copper substrate surface at different initial velocities, with the moment of first contact between the droplet and the wall defined as time zero. The results indicate that increasing the impact velocity significantly influences the spreading behavior. While droplets at different velocities exhibit qualitatively similar spreading and recoiling patterns, the spreading duration decreases with increasing velocity, with higher impact velocities lead to shorter spreading times. This behavior arises because droplets falling at higher velocities possess greater initial kinetic energy. A larger portion of this energy is rapidly converted into the surface energy required for spreading and is simultaneously dissipated more efficiently through viscous effects. As a result, the spreading process is accelerated, reducing the time needed to reach the maximum spreading diameter. After approximately 0.3 s, the recoiling stage is accompanied by the ejection of secondary droplets. Notably, the number of secondary droplets initially increases and then decreases with velocity. When the velocity is 0.1 m/s, one secondary droplet is observed, at the relatively low velocity of 0.1 m/s, the kinetic energy of the droplets is limited, resulting in a thin liquid film with insufficient retraction energy. This can only trigger limited capillary wave instability, leading to the generation of fewer secondary droplets. With the velocity increasing to 0.2 m/s, three secondary droplets are generated, at this stage, the impact kinetic energy significantly increases, causing the droplet to spread into a thinner layer and form a larger, less stable liquid film. During retraction, additional kinetic energy is converted into surface energy, leading to film rupture. The combined effects of Rayleigh-Plateau and crown instability intensify, promoting the formation of three secondary droplets and resulting in the highest degree of splashing. And the velocity increasing to 0.3 m/s, only one secondary droplet is produced. Despite the droplet possesses the highest initial kinetic energy, this energy promotes the formation of a thicker, more stable liquid film during the spreading. Simultaneously, the rapid dissipation of kinetic energy diminishes the intensity of the retraction process. Furthermore, the higher impact velocity can enhance the wettability between the droplet and substrate-establishing a more effective dynamic contact-which directs more energy toward sustaining spreading rather than driving splattering. As a results, the combined effects result in a reduction of secondary droplets to just one. These results suggest that an initial impact velocity of 0.3 m/s can effectively suppress excessive splashing while maintaining stable droplet spreading.

Fig. 14(d) presents that an impact velocity of 0.4 m/s, the droplet reaches its maximum spreading at approximately 0.24 s. Unlike lower velocities, the droplet does not rebound but instead undergoes fragmentation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the combined effects of droplet inertia and aerodynamic resistance. Under identical gravitational and volume conditions, the higher impact velocity generates increased air resistance, which counteracts the restoring force of surface tension. As a result, the droplet loses its spherical stability, elongates into a pear-shaped morphology, and ultimately breaks apart.
Fig. 15 shows the temperature distribution on the substrate surface at 0.1 s during the fall of copper alloy droplets at different speeds. When the speed of droplets increases to 0.1 m/s, 0.2 m/s and 0.3 m/s, the maximum temperature increases to 833 °C, 842 °C and 871 °C, respectively. Since the droplets begin to splash a lot and break after the velocity reaches 0.4 m/s, the droplets begin to splash and break, so in the range of 0–0.4 m/s, the greater the speed of descent, the greater the pressure exerted by the droplet on the substrate surface; thus, the droplet makes a more secure contact with the substrate surface, leading to a greater transfer of heat from the droplet to the substrate.

During the final spreading phase of the droplet, as the initial velocity increases, the spreading length of the droplet at the time of 0.5 s also increases correspondingly with the substrate. Fig. 16 compares the spreading lengths of the droplet at the time of 0.5 s, when the velocity is 0 m/s, 0.1 m/s, 0.2 m/s and 0.3 m/s, the spreading length is 36 mm, 37 mm, 38 mm and 39 mm, respectively. For every 0.1 m/s increase in velocity, the measured spreading length also increases by 1 mm. The primary reason for the linear increase in spreading length with initial velocity is that the additional kinetic energy of the droplet is largely converted into surface energy needed to overcome surface tension and form a new surface, leading to an approximately linear growth in spreading length.

5. Conclusion
This study systematically investigated the heat transfer behavior of liquid copper alloys on different substrates, coatings of varying thicknesses, and surfaces with different roughness, combining experimental characterization with numerical simulations. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the interfacial heat transfer and dynamic spreading behavior of liquid copper alloys, offering useful insights for the thermal design and optimization of coating systems in engineering applications. The key findings can be summarized as follows:
(1)
Heat transfer experiments on different substrates reveal that the copper substrate, owing to its higher thermal conductivity, can absorb and dissipate heat from liquid copper alloys more efficiently than the steel substrate. The central region of the copper substrate exhibits significantly higher heat transfer efficiency, leading to faster heating and cooling rates and lower equilibrium temperatures compared with the steel substrate.
(2)
Numerical simulations of the solidification process demonstrate that copper alloys solidify progressively in a layer-by-layer manner on the steel substrate. Heat is primarily dissipated through the substrate-alloy interface and subsequently conducted from the outer to inner regions, forming a stable and orderly solidification front facilitated by efficient interfacial heat transfer.
(3)
Heat transfer experiments with coatings of different thicknesses indicate that, within the range of 58∼125 μm, increased coating thickness suppresses heat transfer. However, the combined effect of interfacial and coating thermal resistance reduces the marginal gain of thermal resistance. This suggests the existence of an efficiency threshold in thermal regulation by simple coating thickening, highlighting the need for optimizing interfacial thermal resistance to enhance the overall thermal barrier performance.
(4)
For surfaces with varying roughness (Rz = 1.122–3.094 μm), reduced smoothness promotes greater heat transfer from the copper alloy to the substrate. On rougher surfaces, liquid spreading is hindered by micro-protrusions, generating more eddies and stagnation zones where heat accumulates, thereby facilitating enhanced heat transfer to the substrate.
(5)
Simulations of droplet impact dynamics show that fewer secondary droplets are generated on steel substrates compared with copper substrates. Within an initial velocity range of 0∼0.3 m/s, the spreading length of droplets increases with velocity. However, while the velocity increase to 0.4 m/s, droplet stability is disrupted by surface tension effects, resulting in droplet breakup.
