1. Introduction
With the rapid advancement of urban infrastructure construction, submarine tunnels have become increasingly utilized in urban transport and cross-sea passages as an efficient means of utilizing underwater space. Tropical regions present unique opportunities and challenges for the planning and construction of submarine tunnels due to their distinct geographical environments and climatic conditions (Hu and She, 2013; Zhou et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2018a, Hu et al., 2018b). Groundwater infiltration is a common issue encountered during excavation, which not only complicates construction efforts but also poses potential safety risks to adjacent structures. The implementation of the artificial freezing method effectively addresses the challenge of groundwater infiltration, particularly in the context of existing structures and in the construction of unstable, water-rich strata and weak soil layers (Qi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2019). Artificial ground freezing technology employs artificial refrigeration methods to freeze water within the soil strata, transforming the rock and soil into frozen ground. This process creates a freezing curtain in the area, which effectively isolates groundwater and enhances the strength and stability of the soil layer. However, it is important to note that this technology does not effectively prevent the collapse of soil in water-rich strata (Hu et al., 2018a, Hu et al., 2018b; Duan et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 1999). The pipe curtain construction method has emerged as a significant alternative for preventing soil collapse and mitigating various engineering risks. However, it presents certain limitations in water-rich strata, particularly in its ability to impede groundwater flow (Hu and She, 2013; Bai et al., 2023). Therefore, by integrating the pipe curtain method with the artificial freezing method to create the ‘pipe curtain freezing method’, a frozen soil curtain can be established around the pipe curtain through artificial freezing. This approach maximizes the benefits of both techniques: the high stiffness support provided by the pipe curtain method and the effective water sealing capabilities of the artificial freezing method (Hu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2022; Duan et al., 2021). As an innovative reinforcement technology, the pipe curtain freezing method integrates artificial ground freezing technology with pipe curtain support technology, demonstrating significant advantages (Mauro et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2017). The pipe curtain freezing method has been successfully applied in complex projects, such as the Gongbei Tunnel Project of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. This application not only provides valuable experience and practical guidance for similar projects but also marks the first successful implementation of the pipe curtain freezing method in tunnel undercuts in China (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2022).
In recent years, domestic scholars have achieved significant results in the study of forced thawing using the pipe curtain freezing method. They have conducted relevant research on the thawing temperature field through numerical simulations, model tests, and field measurements. Levin et al. (Levin et al., 2021) found that the natural thawing of frozen rock can be sustained for decades by understanding the thawing process of frozen rock within the permafrost wall. This understanding was achieved through a series of on-site measurements monitoring the thawing process of the freezing wall in a potash mine. Cai et al. (2023) conducted a large-scale physical model test on the natural thawing of an artificial permafrost wall. The test results indicated that the soil temperature underwent four distinct stages during the natural thawing process: a rapid rise, a brief lag, a secondary rapid rise, and a linear slow rise. These findings provide a robust foundation for developing a numerical computation model of the three-dimensional non-uniform natural thawing temperature field. Hong et al. (2021) established a robust prediction method for surface thawing and subsidence based on random medium theory. They formulated a time function for surface thawing, subsidence, and consolidation during the natural thawing period of the tunnel's horizontal freezing wall. The findings indicate that during the natural thawing process, the thawing displacement rate of permafrost exceeds the consolidation displacement rate. Consequently, permafrost undergoes consolidation at a lower settlement rate for an extended duration following the natural thawing. Fu et al. (2020) employed a three-dimensional finite element method to investigate the natural thawing characteristics of artificial horizontal permafrost in shield tunnel construction. They analyzed the isobars of the permafrost's natural thawing temperature field surrounding the tunnels, as well as the radial and vertical distributions of the natural thawing temperature. The findings of this study contribute to the limited existing database and enhance the understanding of the natural thawing heat transfer behavior of artificially frozen soils in shield tunnel construction. Zhang et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive and systematic study on the forced thawing temperature field generated by a single heat transfer pipe with an unstable outer surface temperature, utilizing analytical calculations grounded in similarity theory. Their research yielded insights into the distribution law of the thawing temperature field, the thawing radius, heat flow density, and the calculation formula for the average thawing temperature. Ren et al. (2023) aimed to comprehensively explore the mechanisms of the active freezing and thawing processes associated with the new pipe curtain freezing method in construction. They utilized finite element software to establish a numerical model for analyzing the temperature field of this method. The results indicate that a larger head difference correlates with an extended thawing time. Additionally, at a constant head, higher thawing temperatures result in shorter thawing times, with the thawing time at 50 °Cbeing approximately half that at 5 °C. Hu et al. (2017) conducted on-site prototype tests that focused on the thawing process and temperature field changes during both natural thawing and ‘natural + forced’ thawing. The results indicate that, due to the limited volume of permafrost, the duration required for both methods is shorter than that of conventional freezing methods. Furthermore, upon lifting the insulation curtains, the melting rate of the curtains is sufficiently rapid to close the reinforcing pipes. This study represents the first examination of the thawing law, which holds significant implications for subsequent construction efforts.
Generally, both domestic and international experts and scholars have conducted research on the changing patterns of thawing temperature fields resulting from various freezing methods, achieving notable progress in the study of natural thawing. However, there are still relatively few domestic projects that utilize the pipe curtain freezing method in undersea tunnels, and research on the forced thawing process of undersea tunnels using freezing methods remains scarce. This paper focuses on the pipe curtain freezing project of the Sanya Estuary Passage undersea tunnel, where similar model experiments are designed to analyze the experimental behavior of forced thawing under circulating hot water at 40 °C. The accuracy of the numerical model is validated by comparing the results of numerical simulations with model tests. Additionally, this study includes cloud diagrams of the temperature field under circulating hot water at varying temperatures, as well as an analysis of the thawing behavior of the permafrost curtain through numerical simulation.
2. Engineering background
2.1. Overview of the project
The Sanya estuary channel submarine tunnel project spans the estuary of the Sanya River, connecting the Hexi District and Luhuitou Peninsula. This section traverses an area characterized by dense urban development, including numerous sensitive buildings and a complex network of underground pipelines. Additionally, the estuary section contains underground fiber-optic cables and gas pipelines, resulting in significant mutual impacts between the project and its surrounding environment. The tunnel is planned to have a total length of approximately 3180 m. Within the estuarine section, the strata are predominantly composed of water-rich soils, characterized by low bearing capacity, high compressibility, and poor stability. Given these geological conditions, the project employs a pipe curtain freezing method for the construction of the estuary section, which differs from traditional pipe curtain methods. This approach utilizes a combination of combined pipes and independent pipes in a joint jacking process. Forced thawing is implemented to accelerate the thawing time of the soil compared to natural thawing, allowing for improved control over settlement caused by thawing. Fig. 1 illustrates the location of the Sanya estuary channel project.

2.2. Freeze programme design
As illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the freezing pipes for this project have a diameter of φ108 mm and a wall thickness of 10 mm, comprising a total of 176 pipes arranged in two layers. Specifically, 96 freezing pipes are positioned in the outer circle, while 80 freezing pipes are located in the inner circle. The freezing area is categorized into a strong freezing area and a weak freezing area. In the strong freezing area, the spacing between the pipes is 800 mm, whereas in the weak freezing area, the spacing is 950 mm. The pipe curtain in the strong freezing area is configured as a single steel pipe jacking, while the weak freezing area features three occluded steel pipes jacking. This arrangement aims to reduce freezing costs while ensuring effective water sealing and support. Additionally, 48 square freezing pipes, measuring 100 mm × 60 mm × 5 mm, are welded at the edges of the three occluded steel pipes and the independent steel pipes. In the estuary section, 28 steel pipes are arranged in a ring direction, consisting of 8 groups of occluded steel pipes and 4 independent steel pipes. The outer diameter of the middle pipe of the occluded steel pipes is 2.1 m, while the two side pipes have an outer diameter of 2.0 m, and the independent steel pipes have an outer diameter of 2.2 m. Upon completion of the freezing process, the steel pipes are interconnected by cutting and joining them, which effectively ensures water sealing and support while minimizing freezing costs. After freezing, the pipe curtain is formed by cutting and welding connecting steel plates between the steel pipes, with maximum vertical and horizontal dimensions of the encircled area measuring 18.43 m. The freezing curtain can be further categorized into top plate freezing area, bottom plate freezing area, west side freezing area, and east side freezing area based on their respective locations.

3. Similarity criteria
3.1. Derivation of the similarity criterion
The model test is a prototype similarity test conducted using an isometric or scaled-down model. Meeting the relevant similarity criteria—such as temperature field criteria and humidity field criteria—is essential for the successful execution of these tests. Therefore, this paper establishes a model test system for forced thawing of the most unfavorable soil layer in the tube curtain freezing method for shallow-buried tunnels in Linhai, drawing on experiences in physical model design and similarity theory (Qi et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2019). The equation analysis method is employed to ascertain the similarity criteria, as outlined below.
3.2. Temperature field similarity criterion
The differential control equation for soil thermal conductivity is:
(1)
where 
 is the radial coordinate; 
 is the time; 
 is the temperature at point r, the unfrozen zone at 
 and the frozen zone at 
; and 
 is the heat diffusion coefficient of the soil.
The initial and boundary conditions for the temperature field are:
(2)
where 
 is the initial soil temperature, 
 is the radius of the freezing pipe, 
 is the coordinates of the outer surface of the freezing wall, 
 is the soil freezing temperature, and 
 is the temperature of the freezing pipe wall.
The heat balance equation at the thaw front (
) is:
(3)
where 
 is the thermal conductivity of the soil and 
 is the latent heat of phase change of the soil.
According to Eqs. (1), (2), (3), the similarity criterion of the soil temperature field can be obtained by equation analysis:
(4)
Where 
 is the Fourier criterion, 
; 
 is the Kosovich criterion, 
; 
 is the specific heat capacity of the soil; 
 is the temperature; 
 is the geometrical criterion; 
 is the temperature criterion, 
; 
 and 
 are the mean temperature of the freezing wall and the brine temperature respectively. In order to reduce the error of the test, the soil used in this model test is taken from the construction site of the project, so 
, the water content is the same, and the latent heat generated by the phase change of ice and water in the soil is equal, which is obtained by substituting into Eq. (4)
(5)
(6)
From Eq. (5), the time similarity ratio in the model test is the square of the geometric similarity ratio, 
 is the geometric similarity ratio, and 
 is the time similarity ratio; from Eq. (6), the temperature in the model test is kept unchanged from the engineering reality, so the temperature similarity ratio is 1.
3.3. Moisture field similarity criterion
Due to the presence of a moisture field, moisture migration occurs in the formation during freezing as well as thawing. The differential governing equations are as follows:
(7)
The initial and boundary conditions for the humidity field are
(8)
where 
 is the moisture content and 
 is the moisture conductivity.
Based on Eqs. (7), (8), the similarity criterion equation for the soil moisture field was determined by equation analysis as:
(9)
where H is the humidity criterion and 
 is the humidity field Fourier criterion, 
.
From the above equation, it can be seen that the moisture migration process exhibited by the moisture field is similar to the freezing and thawing heat transfer process in terms of mathematical modelling, both of which satisfy the Fourier criterion. Therefore, under geometrically similar conditions, when the temperature field is consistent, the moisture field is also consistent. Based on the derived similarity criterion, the similarity of the most critical parameters in the model tests is shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Similarity constants for model tests.

Parameters	Geometric similarity ratio	Time similarity ratio	Temperature similarity ratio	Moisture Similarity Ratio
Similarity ratio	20	400	1	1
This test is based on the actual arrangement of steel pipes, the diameter of frozen pipes, and the expected freezing range for the Sanya Estuary Channel submarine tunnel project. Taking into account the test conditions, results, manual operability, and the fabrication level of pipe fittings and pipelines, a comprehensive geometric similarity ratio of 20 has been derived. A comparison of the parameter sizes between the prototype and the model is presented in Table 2.
Table 2. Prototype and model geometry.

Parameters	Prototype size	Model size
Diameter of occlusal steel tube / mm	2000	100
Intermediate diameter of occlusal steel tubes / mm	2100	105

4. Model test system
The purpose of this model test is to investigate the thawing behavior of the permafrost curtain during the forced thawing process associated with the pipe curtain freezing method used in the Sanya estuary passage project. The design of the physical similarity model test system adheres to the principles of similarity theory and complies with the Technical Conditions of Low Temperature Test Chamber (GB/T10589–2008). This system primarily comprises the test model box, freezing pipes, steel pipes, cryogenic freezing and refrigeration equipment, data acquisition devices, and sensor devices. The architecture of the model test system is illustrated in Fig. 3.

4.1. Model box
According to the freezing design scheme and the relevant design experiences and experimental conclusions from the Sanya Estuary Channel project, the influence range of the freezing area has been thoroughly considered. The model test was conducted using a geometric shrinkage ratio of 20, with the model test box dimensions measuring 1800 mm in length, 500 mm in width, and 1800 mm in height. To enhance the deformation resistance of the model box, a steel thickness of 25 mm was selected for the sides and 50 mm for the bottom. Additionally, to prevent the freezing expansion force from damaging the model box and to reduce the horizontal constraint capacity, the box was reinforced with channels on both sides, while the front and rear ends were supported with diagonally rolled beams and reinforcement plates. The model test box is illustrated in Fig. 4.

4.2. Freeze pipes and steel pipes
The steel pipe that constitutes the pipe curtain is made of high-strength stainless steel, comprising a total of 28 pipes. This includes 16 occlusal steel pipes with dimensions of φ100 × 5 mm, 8 occlusal intermediate steel pipes measuring φ105 × 5 mm, and 4 independent steel pipes sized φ110 × 5 mm. The freezing pipes are also constructed from seamless stainless steel, with their ends gradient-ground to facilitate positioning and waterproof sealing. There are a total of 176 round freezing pipes with dimensions of φ5.4 mm × 2 mm, and 48 square freezing pipes measuring 5 mm × 3 mm with a thickness of 2 mm. The steel tube and the freezing tubes are illustrated in Fig. 5.

4.3. Refrigeration equipment
The refrigeration circulating equipment is crucial for controlling the brine temperature during the freezing process, as it directly influences the test results. The effectiveness of the refrigeration box is pivotal to the entire experiment. To ensure optimal performance, the refrigeration box must provide a sufficiently high refrigeration capacity and circulation flow. Therefore, we selected the TMS9025-15 K refrigeration box, which has a refrigeration capacity range of 15 to 25 kW. This model can maintain a temperature control range from −40 °C to +50 °C and achieves a maximum circulation flow of 50 L/min. These specifications are essential to meet the temperature and circulation flow requirements for the brine cycle thawing process. The main components of the refrigeration equipment are illustrated in Fig. 6.

4.4. Data acquisition systems
Temperature data acquisition is a core component of the test, which is organized into a total of nine temperature measurement paths. Paths 1 to 4 are situated in the strong freezing area of the pipe curtain connection, with each path featuring the No. 4 observation point located at the center of the steel pipe gap. On either side of this point, three additional observation points are arranged at intervals of 0.05 m, corresponding to a numerical simulation distance of 1 m. Each path includes a total of seven measurement points, with the temperature observation points numbered from 1 to 7 and spaced 0.35 m apart. Paths 5 to 9 are located in the weak freezing zone, where the observation points on each path are symmetrically arranged in relation to the steel pipe of the pipe curtain. Specifically, the No. 2 and No. 3 observation points are positioned 0.05 m from the edge of the steel pipe, while the No. 1 and No. 4 observation points are also spaced 0.05 m apart. Each path consists of four measurement points, resulting in a total of 48 temperature measurement points across the test. The layout of the measurement points is illustrated in Fig. 7. The data acquisition system employed in the test includes T-type thermocouples, DAQM-4203 data acquisition and transmission devices, and computers. The accuracy of data acquisition is critical as it directly influences the analysis and processing of the test results. Sensors are securely fixed and calibrated using calipers and marking pens, and the connections are debugged via computer to ensure accurate data collection, with a data acquisition frequency set at one measurement per minute.

4.5. Experimental process
Approximately 2.5 cubic meters of soil excavated from the site were placed in a centralized location within the school testing area to dry under sunlight on a flat surface. Random samples of the soil were collected at three-day intervals and analyzed for moisture content to assess whether the drying process was satisfactory. Following several rounds of testing, the soil pieces that met the drying criteria were crushed and sieved. After multiple rounds of preliminary testing, the soil was selected for compaction after every 10 cm of filling. Each 100 cm2 of contact area was compacted with 20 strokes from a high drop distance and 30 strokes from a low drop distance to ensure the soil was flat and dense. The thickness of the soil lifted after compaction and the quality of the soil used were documented in the modelling box. Additionally, the quality of the pure water used was uniformly sprayed according to the specified standards. The soil was then sealed and allowed to consolidate for 48 h, after which the height and water content of the soil were recorded upon completion of the filling process. After filling, the height of the soil was recorded, and random points were sampled to determine the water content. The filling process continued in layers once the requirements were met. According to the freezing pipe arrangement plan, holes should be drilled in advance at the end face of the box to establish the positioning area. During the filling process, the freezing pipe and the steel pipe are inserted into the soil body of the box through the sealing fixture at designated positions. Based on the sensor arrangement plan, it is essential to determine the burial position of the sensors to ensure the accurate positioning of the measurement points. To prevent soil settlement from causing movement of the measuring points, which would affect measurement accuracy, the testing procedure was conducted after the soil body was compacted and allowed to consolidate. Prior to burying the sensors, a level was used for surface measurement, and a measuring tape was employed to determine the exact location for sensor burial, ensuring that the measuring points accurately correspond to the layout of the program. The thermocouples are secured with stainless steel rods to ensure precise control over the spacing and positioning of the measurement points during the filling process. Once the freezing pipe and steel pipe are inserted into the box according to the arrangement, a waterproof sealant is applied to the contact surfaces of the sealing device and the pipes to ensure effective sealing throughout the testing process. Before activating the freezing system, insulation is applied to the model box and pipes to prevent cold loss and maintain freezing efficiency. The aforementioned test process is illustrated in Fig. 8.

5. Analysis of experimental results
5.1. Analysis of path observation points
The warming curves for the seven temperature observation points along paths 2 and 4 are illustrated in Fig. 9. The two paths within the strongly frozen zone exhibit a similar development pattern of warming curves throughout the thawing period. During the forced thawing process, temperature changes in both the strong and weak thawing zones can be categorized into four distinct stages: Stage A (rapid rise), Stage B (phase change latent heat), Stage C (secondary rapid rise), and Stage D (linear slow rise). In the pre-thaw period, temperature observation points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on both paths demonstrate a faster warming rate when no phase change occurs in the frozen wall. The four observation points, Path2-(3,5) and Path4-(3,5), are closest to the freezing tube; consequently, the lower temperatures at the time of freezing result in lower temperature values during thawing. However, under the influence of a temperature gradient of 40 °C, rapid warming occurs, and the warming rate decreases as the temperature approaches approximately 0 °C, marking the onset of a brief ice-water phase transition. This transition phase is notably short, with the most extended duration occurring prior to this phase. Following this, the temperature rises rapidly, entering a stable thawing phase, where the temperature gradually increases and eventually stabilizes. After approximately 0.42 h of thawing, the observatory returns to a room temperature of about 20 °C. The observation points Path2-(2,6) and Path4-(2,6) entered the ice-water phase transition stage almost simultaneously, requiring 7.2 min to complete the transition. Following this, the warming rate increased, although it remained slower compared to observation points 3 and 5. This discrepancy can be attributed to the positioning of observation points 2 and 6 at the edge of the freezing tube, which necessitated additional time for heat transfer from the thawing tube to these areas. Approximately 1.1 h into the thawing process, both observation points returned to a room temperature of around 20 °C. In contrast, observation points Path2–4 and Path4–4, located within the freezing area but situated in the gap between the pipe curtains and steel pipes, entered the phase transition stage later, at 0.48 h, but experienced a shorter duration in this phase. Subsequently, their temperatures rose linearly at a faster rate than those of observation points 3 and 5, primarily due to the heat transfer from the freezing pipes on either side of the strong freezing zone to the gap between the pipe curtain and steel pipe. On the other hand, Path2-(1,7) and Path4-(1,7), positioned at the edge of the freezing area, only reached a temperature of approximately −1 °C by the end of the freezing process. Their distance from the freezing tube resulted in minimal heat transfer to this thawing area initially. Moreover, once the freezing pipes ceased operation and began thawing, the heat transfer effect caused the colder frozen region to transfer cold to the edge frozen region. This phenomenon contributed to a slower rate of temperature increase in the edge frozen region during thawing, prolonging the duration of the phase change stage, which lasted until 1.38 h before the phase change process was completed. Ultimately, it took approximately 2.64 h of thawing for the site to return to a room temperature of about 20 °C.

Fig. 9. Warming curves of characteristic monitoring points in strongly frozen areas.

The temperature observation points are situated within the phase change stage between ice and water. During this phase change, the rate of warming is notably slow, and the temperature curve exhibits a smooth and linear trend. This phenomenon primarily results from the latent heat absorbed during the melting of ice into water within the soil, which causes a flattening of the warming rate over a specific period.
Fig. 10 illustrates the warming curves of four temperature observation points located along paths 5, 8, and 9. The warming curve development pattern for the three paths within the weakly frozen zone remains consistent throughout the thawing period. As depicted in the graphs, observation points 2 and 3 on paths 5 and 8, which are situated closer to the freezing tube, exhibit a faster warming rate prior to the occurrence of phase change in the frozen wall. Subsequently, they enter a brief phase change phase that lasts approximately 5 min, which is notably longer than the duration observed at the observation points near the freezing tube within the strongly frozen zone. Following this, the temperature rises rapidly, reaching room temperature after approximately 0.6 h of thawing. Conversely, observation points 1 and 4, located further from the freezing tubes, experience a prolonged phase transition process, lasting around 0.72 h. This duration exceeds that of the observation points near the freezing tubes in the strongly frozen zone, with room temperature being attained after approximately 2.4 h of thawing. The warming pattern observed at the points on path 9 aligns closely with that of the other weakly frozen zones. This is attributable to the arrangement of the temperature observation points, where observation points No. 1 and No. 2 are positioned within the inner measurement of the freezing zone, closer to the inner measurement of the strongly frozen zone, while observation points No. 3 and No. 4 are situated farther from the outer strong freezing zone. During the previous freezing process, the intense freezing area created by the cold can be rapidly transferred to observation points 1 and 2. Consequently, prior to thawing, their temperatures are lower than those of the symmetrically arranged observation points 3 and 4. Although observation point 3 enters the phase transition stage earlier than observation point 2, it takes 3.6 min longer to complete the phase transition and an additional 0.24 h to reach room temperature. Similarly, observation point 4 takes 0.3 h longer to complete the phase transition compared to observation point 1, and 0.18 h longer to achieve room temperature.

5.2. Temporal and spatial profiles of path temperature
To further investigate the temperature change dynamics within the strong freezing zone, specifically at the intersection gaps of steel pipes, we selected temperature change data from two monitoring paths: Path 1, located on the left side, and Path 3, situated on the top plate of the strong freezing zone. The thawing times analyzed include 0 h, 0.12 h, 0.24 h, 0.36 h, 0.66 h, 1.14 h, 1.56 h, and 1.98 h, enabling a comprehensive spatio-temporal pattern analysis of temperature variations within the strong freezing zone. Fig. 11 illustrates the temporal and spatial change patterns observed on the left side and the top plate of the strong freezing zone.

Fig. 11. Analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of temperature change in the path of the strong freezing zone.

As illustrated in Fig. 11, the lowest temperature at the gap occurs at a distance of 0.05 m from the center of the gap, where the temperature deviates most significantly from the phase change temperature. At a freezing time of 0.12 h, the temperature observation point located 0.1 m from the gap center shows a marked change compared to the previous time point. This indicates vigorous heat exchange between the soil body and the freezing pipe, resulting in significant temperature variations. In contrast, the temperature change at the center of the gap is minimal, as the heat generated by the frozen pipes on either side is not transferred to the center of the gap in a short time frame. As thawing progresses, the temperatures at the observation points 0.1 m away from the center of the gap continue to rise. The overall thawing and melting of the frozen soil at the gap primarily depend on the heat emanating from the inner and outer freezing tube areas, gradually warming the region. Ultimately, the temperature at the gap reaches above 0 °C at approximately 0.66 h. Between 0.66 h and 1.14 h, the temperature at the center experiences considerable fluctuations due to significant temperature changes between the inner and outer soil and the center position. The reason for this is the significant temperature gradient that exists between the outer soil and the soil at the center. However, the temperatures at the observation points located 0.15 m from the center remained relatively unchanged. Notably, the temperature did not exhibit any significant variation until 1.14 h into the thawing process, and the increase in temperature was minimal. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the arrangement of the freezing tubes was appropriate, as the center of the gap, which is distanced from the thermal source, approached room temperature during the mid to late stages of thawing.
To further elucidate the temperature change dynamics within the weakly frozen zone, we extracted the temperature change data from paths 6 and 7 for a comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal temperature variation in this zone, as illustrated in Fig. 12. The figure demonstrates that the spatio-temporal temperature change trends at each observation point in the weakly frozen zone on the right side are relatively similar to those on the upper side. Notably, at a distance of 0.05 m from the edge of the steel pipe, the warming rate between the temperature observation points from 0 h to 0.24 h is notably rapid. Once the temperature approaches approximately 0 °C, a marked flattening of the warming rate occurs, indicating a transition into the transient phase transition stage. Subsequently, a significant temperature increase is observed during the period from 0.36 h to 0.66 h, with the highest heating rate recorded at 1.2 °C/min. In contrast, the observation point located 0.1 m from the edge of the steel pipe exhibits a smaller temperature change from 0 h to 0.66 h, remaining consistently below 0 °C, thus indicating a prolonged duration before entering the ice-water phase transition stage. Following this, a notable temperature increase is recorded from 0.96 h to 1.62 h, with the rate of increase reaching 0.44 °C/min. Overall, as illustrated in the figure, it is evident that the melting of the frozen wall in the weakly frozen zone occurs more rapidly on the inner side of the curtain compared to the outer side.

6. Numerical simulation analysis
6.1. Basic model assumptions
The numerical model is developed based on several fundamental assumptions to facilitate calculations and ensure the relative accuracy of the results. These assumptions include:
(1)
The temperature distribution around the freezing tube is uniform, and the heat transfer within the frozen porous medium adheres to Fourier's law;
(2)
The decrease in the freezing point due to solute concentration is negligible; ice remains stationary and does not undergo deformation;

It is assumed that the walls of the circular and square freezing tubes act as the temperature load. The refrigerant temperature is derived from the wall temperature, with no energy loss occurring during heat transfer between the refrigerant and the soil. Heat conduction and convection are the primary mechanisms of heat transfer during the establishment of the temperature field, which is characterized as transient heat conduction;

The effects of gravity and other stresses are not considered in the model's coupling process. Soil freezing occurs when the temperature of the soil body falls below −1 °C. Water migration during the phase change of the soil is neglected, with only the latent heat generated during the phase transitions of ice and water being accounted for.
6.2. Numerical modelling
In accordance with the actual buried depth of the project, the boundary error resulting from the influence range of the freezing wall and the complexity of the model calculations necessitated the establishment of a three-dimensional finite element model. The model's pipe curtain, freezing pipe diameter, spacing, and arrangement form are consistent with the actual project specifications. The dimensions of the freezing pipe are φ108 mm × 10 mm. The selected model dimensions for the temperature field analysis of forced defrosting are 30 m × 10 m × 30 m, as depicted in the overall model figure. The model is surrounded by an adiabatic impermeable boundary, with a temperature load applied to the frozen pipe. The numerical model is calculated using a user-defined free tetrahedral mesh with an adaptive method. To reduce computational error and enhance convergence, the freezing pipe is meshed first to minimize its mesh size. In the boundary region, the grid size can be increased appropriately, as it is not directly influenced by the temperature changes of the freezing tube, allowing for a reasonable division of grid density. The final grid of the numerical model consists of 726,421 cells. This process is illustrated in Fig. 13.

6.3. Comparative analysis of numerical modelling and testing
To facilitate a better comparison between the results of numerical simulations and model tests conducted under corresponding scaled conditions, the thawing time derived from the numerical simulations was converted to align with the model tests. Representative temperature monitoring data were extracted, and two observation points were selected for comparative analysis within the strong and weak freezing zones: Path1–4, Path2–7, Path5–4, and Path9–1. Fig. 14 illustrates the comparison of temperature data from both the tests and numerical simulations during the thawing process in the strong and weak freezing zones.

Fig. 14. Comparison of model test and numerical simulation temperature data.

As illustrated in Fig. 14, the experimental cooling curves obtained from the temperature measurement points during the thawing and melting process exhibit similarities to the cooling curves derived from numerical simulations. Specifically, the measured temperatures and the corresponding numerical simulation results for the Path1–4 measurement points are 39.93 °C and 37.927 °C, respectively. For the Path2–7 measurement points, the values are 31.814 °C and 30.616 °C; for the Path5–4 points, they are 36.223 °C and 35.428 °C; and for the Path9–1 points, they are 38.556 °C and 37.428 °C, respectively. The temperature differences between the measured and simulated temperatures for these four points range from 1.5 °C to 2 °C, which aligns with the acceptable error margins. Notably, the numerical simulation temperatures for the four measurement points are lower than the experimental temperatures during the initial phase of thawing. However, as the circulating hot water temperature rises to 40 °C, the numerical simulation temperatures gradually exceed the experimental temperatures in the later stages of thawing.
The physical parameters of the soil utilized in the numerical simulation align with those of the physical model test; however, the numerical simulation undergoes phase transformation and completes this process earlier than the physical test. Factors such as heat loss and human construction at the test site introduce discrepancies when comparing the results of the numerical simulation and the model test. Nevertheless, by analyzing the temperature changes at both numerical and simulated measurement points, it is evident that the warming patterns are consistent across both research methods, thereby confirming the reliability of the established numerical model.
6.4. Forced thawing temperature field analysis
The comparative analysis of the numerical simulations and the test data indicates a temperature difference of approximately 1.5 °C to 2 °C, which serves to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulations. To investigate the effects of varying temperatures of circulating hot water on the thawing temperature field, we analyzed the forced thawing temperature fields at circulating hot water temperatures of 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C, alongside the 0 °C isotherm for comparative purposes. In this context, the black line in the temperature field cloud represents the 0 °C isotherm. Fig. 15 illustrates the temperature field cloud diagram and the 0 °C isotherm at different temperatures of circulating hot water.

Fig. 15. Temperature field cloud diagrams at different temperatures of circulating hot water and 0 °C isotherms.

In the early stages of thawing, as illustrated in Fig. 15, the 0 °C isotherms are predominantly concentrated around the freezing tube. The inner and outer strong freezing zones are the first to exhibit an intersection of the 0 °C isotherms, indicating that only a limited area of the strong freezing zones within the permafrost curtain has begun to melt. The application of 20 °C circulating hot water took 7 days to achieve the intersection of the 0 °C isotherms in both the inner and outer strong thawing zones. It took 5 days to complete the intersection at 30 °C and 40 °C, 4 days for 50 °C and 60 °C, and 3 days for 70 °C and 80 °C. In the middle stages of thawing, as heat spreads outward, the permafrost curtain began to melt more extensively, resulting in the inner and outer strong and weak thawing zones achieving the intersection of the 0 °C isotherms. At this stage, a thawing circle formed, although a gap in the curtain remained unmelted. The time taken for the intersection of the 0 °C isotherms within the strong and weak thawing zones is inversely correlated with the temperature of the circulating hot water. As thawing time increases, the 0 °C isotherm gradually diminishes, indicating that the permafrost curtain has completely melted and the temperature has risen above 0 °C. Ultimately, the time required for complete thawing of the soil under varying temperatures of circulating hot water was recorded as follows: 36 days for 20 °C, 26 days for 30 °C, 21 days for 40 °C, 17 days for 50 °C, 15 days for 60 °C, 14 days for 70 °C, and 13 days for 80 °C circulating hot water.
6.5. Analysis of path observation points
In order to better understand the thawing behavior of forced thawing soil under varying temperatures of circulating hot water, temperature observation points were selected in the strong freezing zone on the left side and the weak freezing zone at the top, specifically at Path1–4 and Path7–4, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 16, it is evident that an increase in the temperature of the circulating hot water results in a faster warming rate. When the temperature of the circulating hot water exceeds 50 °C, the phase transition stage is reached earlier, thereby accelerating the phase transition process. This acceleration is primarily due to the higher thermal energy of the circulating hot water, which significantly enhances the heating of the soil body. At the conclusion of the phase transformation process, the temperature observation points in the strong freezing zone exhibited a faster warming rate compared to those in the weak freezing zone. This phenomenon can be attributed to Path1–4 being situated within the gap of the pipe curtain steel pipe; when the temperatures on both sides of the strong thawing zone reach 0 °C or higher, a substantial temperature differential exists with the gap of the steel pipe, facilitating increased heat transfer. Conversely, Path7–4 is positioned at the edge of the weak thaw zone, where only a limited amount of heat is transferred from one side of the weakly frozen zone to the edge.

6.6. Complete thawing time of soil under circulating hot water at different temperatures
Fig. 17 illustrates the relationship between the complete thawing time of the soil body and the temperature of the circulating hot water. From the figure, it is evident that the thawing time decreases significantly as the circulating hot water temperature increases. Specifically, when the temperature rises from 20 °C to 50 °C, there is a marked reduction in thawing time. However, once the circulating hot water temperature exceeds 50 °C, the effect on shortening the thawing time becomes less pronounced, suggesting that the thawing time stabilizes at a certain temperature threshold.

7. Conclusion
This paper is based on the Sanya estuary channel project, focusing on the forced thawing laws and characteristics of the pipe curtain freezing method. A physical model freezing test system has been designed and constructed to simulate the forced thawing process observed in the actual project. Additionally, COMSOL finite element software has been utilized to establish a three-dimensional model grounded in the theory of heat transfer in porous media. Initially, results from the numerical simulation are compared with those from the model tests to validate the accuracy of the numerical model. Subsequently, simulations are performed to analyze the temperature field distribution under the influence of hot water circulating at various temperatures, alongside the thawing dynamics of the permafrost curtain. By integrating physical model tests with numerical simulations, this study systematically elucidates the evolution of the temperature field and the melting behavior of permafrost during forced thawing using the pipe curtain freezing method. This research provides theoretical support and technical references for similar projects. The main conclusions drawn are as follows:
(1)
The scientific validity and reliability of the two methods are confirmed through a comparative analysis of the results from numerical simulations and similar model box tests. The temperature change trend during the freezing process of the two research methods aligns closely, with a temperature difference ranging from 1.5 °C to 2 °C. The temperature values calculated via numerical simulation are generally higher than those obtained from the model tests, primarily due to the more idealized parameter conditions in the numerical simulations, whereas the model tests are influenced by more complex factors. Nevertheless, the overall trends and thawing behaviors observed in both methods remain consistent, establishing the reliability of the numerical model.
(2)
From the analysis of the experimental results, it is concluded that the warming curves of the strong and weak thawing zones are essentially similar. Closer proximity to the thawing tube results in a faster warming rate, and the duration of the ice-water phase transition is notably shorter. In the strong thawing zone, the nearest temperature observation point to the freezing tube experiences a phase change in only 0.05 h, taking 0.42 h to reach room temperature. Conversely, the observation point located at the farthest edge requires 1.3 h for the phase change and 2.64 h to achieve room temperature, resulting in a difference of 1.25 h and 2.22 h, respectively. In the weak thawing zone, the nearest observation point to the freezing tube also undergoes a phase change in just 0.083 h, taking 0.6 h to reach room temperature. For observation points along path 10, points 3 and 4, situated within the inner measurement of the tube curtain, are closer to the strong thawing zone. Consequently, their melting rate is faster compared to observation points 1 and 2 on the outer side.
(3)
The central point of the gap in the strong thawing area represents a unique location. Analysis of the temporal and spatial change curves of the observational path indicates that during the pre-thawing period, the temperature remains relatively stable. Overall, the thawing and melting of permafrost at the crevice is primarily attributed to the gradual warming of the heat sources in both the inner and outer strong thawing areas. Consequently, the temperature at the crevice rises above 0 °C within approximately 0.66 h. Notably, the temperature at the center of the crevice experiences significant fluctuations between 0.66 h and 1.14 h, which can be attributed to the steep temperature gradient between the inner and outer soils and the soil at the center.
(4)
The temperature field cloud diagram and the 0 °C isotherm clearly illustrate that varying temperatures of circulating hot water significantly influence the temperature field during forced thawing, as well as the thawing rate. Notably, the inter-circle time of the strong thawing zone, along with the inner and outer strong and weak thawing zones, decreases markedly with the increase in circulating hot water temperature. Specifically, the inter-circle times for the strong thawing zone at circulating hot water temperatures of 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C are 7 days, 5 days, 5 days, 4 days, 4 days, 3 days, and 3 days, respectively. Meanwhile, the inter-circle times for the inner and outer strong and weak thawing zones are 13 days, 11 days, 10 days, 8 days, 7 days, 6 days, 5 days, 10 days, 8 days, 7 days, 6 days, and 5 days, respectively.
(5)
The rate of heating increases with the temperature of the circulating hot water. When the temperature of the circulating hot water exceeds 50 °C, the phase change stage is entered earlier, thereby accelerating the phase change process. As the thawing duration extends, the 0 °C isotherm gradually diminishes, signifying that the permafrost layer has completely melted. The thawing time of the soil significantly decreases with an increase in the temperature of the circulating hot water. Specifically, when the temperature rises from 20 °C to 40 °C, the thawing time decreases sharply. However, once the temperature exceeds 50 °C, the effect of further shortening the thawing time becomes less pronounced, indicating that the thawing time stabilizes as the circulating hot water temperature reaches a certain threshold.
