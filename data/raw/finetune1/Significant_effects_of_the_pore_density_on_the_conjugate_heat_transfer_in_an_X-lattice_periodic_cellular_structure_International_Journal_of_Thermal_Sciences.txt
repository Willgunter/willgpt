Abstract
Periodic lattice structures demonstrate considerable potential for applications in heat exchange and thermal management systems. To further improve the thermal performance of the previously developed X-lattice periodic cellular structure with good heat transfer performance, this study proposes three variants with one, two, and three cell layers, denoted as CXL, DXL and TXL based on variations in pore density. The influence of pore density on turbulent flow and heat transfer characteristics was systematically investigated. Numerical simulations were carried out following model validation. The results indicate that under constant Reynolds number, pressure drop, and pumping power conditions, the overall heat transfer performance improves with increasing pore density. Specifically, the maximum enhancement in the overall Nusselt number reaches 163 %, 91 %, and 112 %, respectively. Increased pore density substantially augments the bulk turbulence intensity, which is efficiently conveyed to the endwalls via unique spiral flow structures. Consequently, local heat transfer is markedly improved on both the endwalls and the ligaments, with maximum enhancement rates of up to 48 % and 74 %, respectively. Furthermore, the underlying heat transfer enhancement mechanisms are elucidated. Quantitative analysis reveals that the improved thermal performance is primarily attributed to the significantly enhanced local heat transfer over the lattice core and the increased core surface area. By systematically evaluating thermal performance and clarifying the mechanisms through which pore density enhances heat transfer, this study provides valuable guidance for future engineering applications.

1. Introduction
Open-cell porous media are good convective heat transfer enhancement materials due to its high surface area density and flow mixing capability, which have been widely in heat exchangers and thermal management systems. Such materials can be classified into two main types based on the regularity of their microstructures: the disordered and ordered. In the disordered category, metallic foams predominate, comprising both open-celled and close-celled structures. In contrast, the ordered category primarily consists of structures with various topologies, which is typically open-celled design [1,2]. Disordered porous materials are characterized by randomly formed void structures, where the cell walls of the microstructure exhibit bending deformations, resulting in lower load-bearing capacity. Although these materials possess favorable heat transfer properties, their randomly distributed and complex void structures introduce significant fluid flow resistance [3]. Periodic cellular structures, composed of regularly arranged unit cells, have higher structural load-bearing capacity [4]; they also exhibit good heat transfer performance. Moreover, they provide greater flexibility in topological design, designating them as the key subject of this investigation.
Periodic cellular structures with specifically designed topologies are promising in many applications [5]. In particular for multifunctional applications, these structures are required to fulfill multiple functions, such as providing mechanical strength while enabling convective heat transfer [2]. Specific examples include the active cooling systems of combustion chambers of scramjet engines, passive cooling systems for ventilated brake discs in high-performance vehicles [[6], [7], [8], [9]], etc. Periodic cellular structures typically exhibit complex morphological characteristics that pose challenges for conventional manufacturing processes. Recent advances in additive manufacturing have provided viable solutions to this limitation. This emerging technique is suitable for fabricating complex topological structures.
The superior heat transfer of periodic cellular structures stem from their interconnected porous networks, which simultaneously increase specific surface area and enhance fluid mixing. Therefore, heat exchangers and radiators incorporating such periodic cellular structure generally show enhanced heat transfer capacity per unit volume [10]. Over the past few decades, the academic community has invented various periodic cellular structure, such as those depicted in Fig. 1. As a key component of periodic cellular structure, the morphology of the unit cell plays a crucial role in determining performance. The heat transfer performance and pressure drop of the periodic cellular structure can be modified by changing the morphology of the unit cell [11]. First, different topologies can induce varying flow characteristics and vortex structures, which in turn affect turbulent transport mechanisms and pressure drop. Second, the complex flow behavior of the fluid significantly increases the complexity of fluid interaction with the adjacent structure, thereby enhancing the local thermal heat transfer efficiency at the endwalls and ligaments [8,[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]].

Recently, the authors conducted a systematic review and comparison of periodic cellular structures, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Among all the structures examined, the X lattice demonstrated notable competitiveness under conditions of both fixed pressure drop and pump power conditions [18]. This finding underscores the significant research value that the X-lattice continues to hold. Previous studies have demonstrated that, under identical pressure drop and pumping power, the X-lattice with rectangle cross-sectioned ligaments exhibits comparable heat transfer to the X-lattice with circle cross-sectioned ligaments. However, the friction factor of the latter one is significantly lower than that of the former one. In terms of flow characterization, the unique helical topology of the X-lattice generates highly turbulent spiral primary flows along its more blocked orientation (depicted as OA in Fig. 1), as well as multiple interconnected secondary flows [10,19]. Built upon the unique flow mechanisms of the X-lattice and the factors influencing its thermal performance, the circular X-lattice is selected as the research object in this study.
While modifying the porosity, effective thermal conductivity [20] and specific surface area of the periodic cellular structures are critical, pore density also significantly affects heat transfer performance [21] since different morphologies obtained by varying pore densities correspond to distinct heat transfer areas and flow patterns around the ligaments. As anticipated, pore density significantly influences the thermal performance of porous materials. Kemerli et al. [22] investigated the flow and heat transfer characteristics of metal foam fins with varying porosities and pore densities. Their results demonstrated that these porous fins with modified pore densities could remarkably enhance heat transfer performance under specific operating conditions. Hamidi et al. [23] further analyzed forced convective heat transfer in metal foams with five distinct pore densities across various Reynolds numbers, revealing that pore density directly affects both velocity distribution and local Nusselt number. Analysis of existing literature reveals that studies on the influence of pore density on the thermal performance of porous materials have primarily focused on disordered structures, particularly metal foams. In an overall point of view, the flow in such porous media is actually homogeneous. In contrast, the effects of pore density in periodic cellular structures has received considerably less attention. In the periodic cellular structures, there exists periodic mainstream and vortices. For a given height of the material block, the layer number of the unit cells varies along the height direction. In such situations, the vortices and turbulent transport in different layers are expected to exhibit complex interaction. Therefore, the flow and heat transfer characteristics at different pore densities can not be simply represented by those of the single layered case. For a given porosity, how the variation of pore density affect the overall conjugate heat transfer and pressure drop in such periodic cellular materials remains unknown.
In view of the above, taking the promising X-lattice with circular ligament as the representative, this paper conducts a numerical study of the forced convective fluid flow and heat transfer by comparing the original circular X-lattice with two modified X-lattices featuring different pore densities. For fair comparison, the height and porosity of the three periodic cellular structures remain unchanged, while the pore density is increased by augmenting the number of layers of the unit cells. Evaluation was conducted to compare the heat transfer and thermal dissipation characteristics of the three lattices, under fixed Reynolds number, pressure drop and pumping power conditions, respectively. The main focus of this paper is to investigate: (a) how change in pore density affect thermal performance; (b) the impact of pore density on the local heat transfer at the endwalls and core; (c) the underlying flow and heat transfer mechanisms behind these effects.
2. Morphologies of the X-lattice periodic cellular structure
The three periodic cellular structures compared in this study are shown in Fig. 2(a). The single layered X-lattice with circular ligaments (abbreviated as CXL) is selected as the reference, which was derived from a rectangular cross-sectional X-lattice and has been studied in a previous study [10]. Under a fixed total height, the number of layers of the X-lattice unit cells along the cell height is doubled and tripled to form the other two periodic cellular structures with different pore densities, which are abbreviated separately as DXL and TXL, hereafter. These periodic cellular structures can be fabricated by the additive manufacturing techniques [[24], [25], [26]].

Fig. 2. Morphological details of the circular X-lattice periodic cellular structure with three different pore densities at a fixed porosity of 92.18 %: (a) overview of the structures with a fixed height; (b) geometric parameters.

A previous study [27] demonstrated that the unit cell height significantly affects the thermal performance of porous media. To ensure a systematic comparison among the three periodic cellular structures, an identical unit cell height (H) of 9.66 mm is adopted. Additionally, all the three periodic cellular structures share the same porosity (ε) of 92.18 %. The CXL has overall cell dimensions of l = 12 mm and w = 12 mm. To ensure that the DXL and TXL maintain the same total height as the CXL, their unit cell length, width, ligament diameter, etc. Were proportionally scaled, correspondingly. To minimize the entry and exit effects for convective heat transfer in periodic cellular structure, ten unit cells along the flow direction are considered according to Ref. [18]. This choice also helps to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, the thickness (ts) of the substrate is set to 0.9 mm. For clarity, detailed specifications of the periodic cellular structure are provided in Fig. 2(b) and Table 1.

Fig. 3 compares the heat transfer areas on the endwalls, ligaments and the whole wetted regions among the three periodic cellular structures. Since the three periodic cellular structures have the same total height and the pore density of the DXL and TXL are doubled and tripled reference to the CXL, the core surface area density of the DXL and the TXL are also doubled and tripled. However, the surface area density of the endwalls does not change with the pore density. It is evident that the CXL, which has the lowest pore density, exhibits the smallest heat transfer area, while the TXL, with the highest pore density, exhibits the largest heat transfer area.

3. Numerical details of the convective heat transfer
Convective heat transfer in the three periodic cellular structures were numerically simulated by using the ANSYS CFX. The numerical model was validated according to similar existing experimental studies. Detailed information regarding the numerical setup, evaluation and validation of the numerical model are presented as follows.
3.1. Computational domains, governing equations and boundary conditions
Fig. 4(a) illustrates the computational domain and boundary conditions. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the three periodic cellular structures exhibit geometric symmetry. Accordingly, the fluid dynamic behaviours and heat transfer processes can also be considered symmetric. To mitigate computational complexity, only half of the unit cell array is modelled along the mainstream, encompassing both solid and fluid domains. To ensure numerical stability, two empty channels of length Hi are incorporated upstream and downstream of each periodic cellular structure, promoting convergence toward accurate numerical solutions.

This study employs steady-state numerical simulations with incompressible air as the working fluid, adopting operating parameters detailed in Table 2. Consistent with previous investigations [2,13,28,29], the flow regime is considered turbulent for Reynolds numbers ranging from 2692 to 11087, with the fluid assumed to be remaining stable and possessing constant thermophysical properties. The shear-stress transport turbulence model [30] is implemented to accurately capture the convective heat transfer characteristics in complex periodic cellular structure geometries, leveraging its robust capability to smoothly transition between the low-Reynolds-number k-ω formulation near walls and the high-Reynolds-number k-ε model in bulk flow regions.

The inlet boundary condition is defined by a fixed fluid temperature (Tf,in) of 25 °C and fully developed turbulent flow field two parallel plates, as detailed and validated in Ref. [13]. The outlet employs a mass flow rate boundary condition to ensure mass conservation. The Reynolds number, calculated using the upstream channel average velocity and height, ranges from 2692 to 11087, consistent with the experimental data from published literature used for validation. Symmetric boundary conditions are imposed on the symmetric surfaces for both the fluid and solid domains, ensuring zero gradients for all field variables. Uniform heat flux of q" = 10000 W/m2 is applied to the outer surface of the bottom substrate. Conservative interface flux boundary conditions are used at all solid-liquid interfaces, ensuring continuity of temperature and heat flux across the interface. The remaining surfaces of the computational domain are set to be adiabatic; and all wall surfaces are treated as smooth and no-slip walls.
3.2. Numerical methods
As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), both the solid and fluid domains employ a hybrid grid discretization strategy. The domains are discretised by tetrahedral and prism elements. Tetrahedral cells dominate the bulk regions of both domains, while ten progressively refined prism layers resolve near-wall regions in the fluid domain, ensuring precise capture of flow and thermal boundary layers. The mesh configuration maintains a first-layer height of ∼0.01 mm at solid boundaries, achieving a non-dimensional wall distance (y+) below 1.0 throughout the computational domain [32].
To solve the governing equations numerically, several popular solvers exist in the field of conjugate heat transfer, such as ANSYS Fluent and CFX. Both solvers are based on the finite volume method. The difference between them is that the physical quantities in CFX are stored at the mesh node, while these values are stored at the cell centres in Fluent. During integration of the governing equations for a control volume, physical values at the surfaces of the control volume are obtained by the finite element method in CFX, in which all the nodes in a mesh element are considered. In Fluent, however, these surface values are obtained by the traditional upwind interpolation method. Essentially, the interpolation accuracy in CFX is better with the performance of the finite element method. Based on the authors experience in solving the flow and heat transfer in both solvers, it was found that fluent is very sensitive to mesh quality. Sometimes, with even a small number of poor-quality elements, the solution is very difficult to converge. To fully utilize the potential of the SST k-ω turbulence model, the mesh element size should be small enough to ensure y+<1.0. For the present X-lattice cellular structures, the mesh quality of a small number of elements near the intersected regions among the ligaments and endwalls is difficult to ensure. Based on our tests, the solution did not converge in Fluent. In contrast, the solution was very robust and fast in CFX with the same set of mesh to get a converged solution. Some investigations [33] also demonstrated that the numerical results from ANSYS CFX and Fluent are almost the same as long as convergence and mesh independency are ensured. Therefore, we used the ANSYS CFX to solve the governing equations. The numerical solution employs the high-resolution scheme for the advection terms and the central differencing scheme for diffusion terms in the governing equations, with detailed implementation available in Ref. [34]. Key parameters including total pressure drop, average endwall surface temperature, and conservation imbalances (energy, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulence frequency) throughout the iterative process were monitored. The solution convergence criteria are: (a) normalized residuals stabilizing below 10−6 with no further reduction, (b) conservation imbalances maintained below 0.1 %, and (c) variations in both total pressure drop and average wall temperature remaining within 0.1 % over 200 consecutive iterations.
3.3. Definition of the performance indices
In this study, all periodic cellular structures maintain an identical height H, which serves as the characteristic length scale for determining the Reynolds number (ReH), Nusselt number (Nu), and friction factor (fH). These dimensionless parameters facilitate objective comparison of the flow and thermal performance across different periodic cellular structures configurations.
The Reynolds number (ReH) is expression as [18]:
(19)
where Vm represents the average velocity at the inlet of the upstream flow development channel.
The local Nusselt number (Nu) is used to quantify the local heat transfer and is defined as [18]:
(20)
where h(x, y, z) is the local heat transfer coefficient, which is defined as [18]:
(21)
where q"(x, y, z) and Ts(x, y, z) represents the local heat flux and the local surface temperature; Tf,bulk(x, y, z) denotes the bulk average fluid temperature, and is defined as [18]:
(22)
where Tf,in is the inlet fluid temperature, z is the Cartesian coordinate along the main flow direction with the coordinate system defined in Fig. 4(a).
To evaluate the thermal performance of each periodic cellular structure encompassing both endwall and core regions, the concept of the overall Nusselt number is introduced. Given the periodic arrangement of unit cells along the flow direction, the calculation excludes cells near the inlet and outlet to eliminate entrance and exit effects, focusing instead on the fully developed flow region from the mth to nth unit cells. This methodology provides a robust assessment of the periodic cellular structure’ overall heat transfer performance. The overall Nusselt number is defined as [18]:
(23)
where i represents the sequence number of the unit cells starting from the inlet. Nui represents the overall Nusselt number for the ith unit cell, which is expressed as [18]:
(24)
where hi is the overall heat transfer coefficient for the ith unit cell, defined as [18]:
(25)
where To,i and Tin,i refer to the mass flow rate-weighted average fluid temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the ith unit cell. These temperatures can be obtained through post-processing of the numerical data. Tw,i represents the average temperature of the inner surface of the bottom endwall of the ith unit cell.
To evaluate the pressure drop, the dimensionless friction factor (fi) for each unit cell is introduced. It is defined as [18]:
(26)
where Δpirefers to the mass flow rate-averaged pressure drop across the ith unit cell. Similar to the definition of the overall Nusselt number, the overall friction factor (fH) is defined as [18]:
(27)
3.4. Validation of the numerical model
Validation of the numerical methodology was performed to ensure the reliability of subsequent analysis. Fig. 5 summarizes the numerical predictions and experimental measurements extracted from Refs. [2,13,28,29,35], including overall Nusselt numbers and friction factors. The validation encompasses reference structures including rectangular X-lattice (RXL), Kagome lattice (KL), circular tetrahedral lattice (CTL), and X-lattice honeycomb as documented in Refs. [2,13,28,35]. While experimental details are comprehensively described in these references and thus not repeated here, our comparative analysis reveals maximum relative errors below 13 % between numerical predictions and experimental measurements, within acceptable margins given experimental uncertainties. It should be mentioned that validations of the inlet boundary conditions, endwall flow patterns and streamwise profiles of Nusselt number against experimental results for similar periodic cellular structures have been well documented in Refs. [13,28], which are not presented here for brevity. The demonstrated agreement from both the present results and those from previous studies, coupled with similar heat transfer characteristics observed in the current periodic cellular structure configuration, confirms the appropriateness of the adopted numerical approach for comparative performance evaluation.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. The effects of pore density on the overall heat transfer and pressure drop
The analysis of heat transfer characteristics in specific channels necessitates careful consideration of inlet and outlet effects, particularly for shorter channels where these effects become significant. The introduction of periodic cellular structure core leads to distinct flow features, with lattice topology variations producing different inlet and outlet flow patterns. Detailed examinations of these boundary effects are available in Refs. [2,10,18], the present study focuses on the fully developed flow regions to enable meaningful performance comparisons among the three channel configurations. Specifically, we evaluate the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics by computing averaged values of the overall Nusselt number (NuH) and friction factor (fH) across the fifth to ninth unit cells using Eqs. (5) and (9), respectively. This methodology provides thermal engineers with practical guidelines for periodic cellular structure selection under varying coolant flow conditions.
Prior to performance comparisons, Fig. 6(a) presents the pore density dependence of the overall Nusselt number across three periodic cellular structures at varying Reynolds numbers. Here, the pore density is defined as pores per inch (PPI) along the core height. It can seen that the overall Nusselt number and friction factor increased approximately linearly with the pore density in the logarithmic coordinates throughout the investigated Reynolds number range. Therefore, the overall Nusselt number and friction factor show power-law relationships with the PPI.

Comparison of the overall Nusselt number and friction factor among the periodic cellular structures: (a) and (b) the effect of pore density on overall heat transfer and pressure drop, respectively; (c) and (d) overall Nusselt number and friction factor as a function of Reynolds number, respectively.

Fig. 6(c–d) present the comparative analysis of overall Nusselt numbers and friction factors across Reynolds numbers ranging from 2692 to 11087, revealing TXL sandwich panel as the top-performing configuration in thermal performance, followed by the DXL one. Quantitative analysis shows that the TXL achieves 30.9–41.7 % and 118.5–163.4 % higher Nusselt numbers than the DXL and CXL, respectively. In addition, the superiority of TXL relative to the RXL [2,19] is up to 58.3–96.5 %. In terms of pressure drop, the TXL also has lower friction factor than the RXL. Therefore, the TXL exhibits evidently enhanced heat transfer but with lowered pressure drop, highlighting its superior thermal efficiency and practical advantages for heat transfer applications. Parallel analysis of DXL reveals similarly promising thermal performance, with Nusselt numbers surpassing CXL by 66.9–85.9 % and RXL by 20.9–38.7 %. The pressure drop of the DXL is also evidently lower than that of the RXL.
The preceding analysis conclusively establishes that pore density-dependent topological modifications exert substantial influence on thermal transport characteristics, necessitating a systematic examination of both fluid flow behavior and localized heat transfer characteristics among the periodic cellular structures configurations to fundamentally elucidate the mechanistic origins of their different thermal performances.
4.2. The effects of pore density on the fluid flow
To fundamentally understand the mechanisms of the superior performance of the periodic cellular structure, the following section first investigates pore density effects on flow field characteristics as the basis for elucidating localized thermal transport phenomena. Fig. 7(a) presents the three-dimensional streamline visualizations colored by the turbulence kinetic energy, displaying only half of the symmetric unit cell structure for each configuration. All three periodic cellular structures exhibit characteristic spiral flow patterns, with DXL and TXL developing two and three spiral streams per layer channel respectively, as highlighted in Fig. 7(b), featuring alternating rotational directions between adjacent streams. Pore density variations significantly modify both vortex intensity and turbulence field distributions, with the TXL displaying the highest turbulence kinetic energy magnitude owing to its increased vortex number. While CXL concentrates high turbulence intensity predominantly on ligament leeward surfaces, DXL and TXL additionally exhibit elevated turbulence kinetic energy at spiral vortex interaction zones. These enhanced turbulence regimes originate primarily from strong shear layers formed between: (1) low-speed separated flows and high-speed mainstream flows, and (2) counter-rotating vortex pairs.

As a supplement to the streamline visualization in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 employs the Q-criterion [36] to identify vortex structures through iso-surfaces of the velocity gradient tensor's second invariant, with method validation established through streamline correspondence. The analysis reveals nearly identical vortex patterns between Ligaments A and B as depicted in the figure, mirroring the three-dimensional streamline characteristics, where DXL develops two systems of distinct spiral vortices compared to TXL's three systems. The dominant flow features consist of merged counter-rotating vortex pairs combining with larger longitudinal vortices near Ligaments A and B, while comparatively weaker separation vortices persist along the ligament leeward surfaces and endwall proximity regions.

The distinct flow patterns and vortex configurations in the three periodic cellular structures yield fundamentally different turbulence generation, transport, and dissipation dynamics. As illustrated in Fig. 9, elevated turbulence levels occur near vortex boundaries owing to intense shear between high- and low-velocity regions, while turbulence dissipation remains comparatively weak in these zones. Notably, vortex-induced turbulence intensity substantially exceeds that produced by wall boundary layer shear, with rapid dissipation occurring in the viscous sublayer due to dominant shear effects. As illustrated in Fig. 9(b), high turbulence kinetic energy presents at ligament junctions, driven by strong shear interactions between vortices downstream of ligament A and adjacent high-speed flows. While CXL relies on single spiral flows to transport turbulence kinetic energy, DXL and TXL employ multiple counter-rotating spiral vortices that promote vigorous fluid mixing.

To establish correlations between global flow features and localized thermal transport characteristics, velocity distributions at representative cross-sections were analyzed, as illustrated in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11. Fig. 9(a) demonstrates the velocity distributions on the x-z plane at y = 0.1 mm over the bottom endwall, where fully developed inflow encounters flow obstructions that promote spiral flow development across the initial three-unit cells, thereby enhancing tangential velocity components in the x-y plane while reducing bulk flow velocity until achieving fully developed flow. Since structural similarities in the first-layer configurations across all three periodic cellular structures, comparable bottom endwall velocity distributions can be observed.

Fig. 9(b) displays the turbulent kinetic energy distribution on the aforementioned x-z plane, revealing higher turbulent kinetic energy levels for both the TXL and DXL compared to the CXL. This enhancement originates from their multi-vortex systems, which generate stronger turbulent kinetic energy and facilitate better transport to the endwall than the single-vortex system of the CXL. Notably, DXL outperforms TXL in turbulent kinetic energy distribution due to its distinctive two-vortex systems: minimal turbulent kinetic energy dissipation occurs at the unconstrained vortex-pair interface; consistent rotational direction promotes turbulent kinetic energy transport towards far from x-axis wall regions as shown in Fig. 10; both vortices maintain direct endwall contact for efficient energy transport. In contrast, TXL's triple-vortex system, while similarly avoiding interface dissipation, spiral vortices on both sides transport partial turbulent kinetic energy to its middle vortex, which cannot contact side endwalls, resulting in less efficiency the energy transport for the endwalls than DXL.
Quantitative assessment of spiral flow intensity and turbulence transport dynamics was performed through analysis of tangential velocity distributions at the inlet, midpoint, and outlet regions of the eighth fully-developed unit cell, as shown in Fig. 11. It is revealed that spiral flows substantially augment peripheral tangential velocities while ligament-induced flow obstructions generate a low-velocity central core. The observed high-velocity zones predominantly align with ligament peripheries, demonstrating consistency with the three-dimensional flow patterns visualized in Fig. 7, Fig. 8.
4.3. The effects of pore density on the local heat transfer
The turbulent flow characteristics exhibited by the three periodic cellular structures configurations yield significantly different localized thermal dissipation patterns at both endwalls and ligaments, which collectively govern their global heat transfer performance. To get insight into these mechanisms, local heat transfer patterns on the endwalls and ligaments are discussed in this section.
4.3.1. Local heat transfer on the endwall
Fig. 12(a) presents the local heat transfer characteristics at the endwalls for all the three periodic cellular structures, as indicated by the local Nusselt number (Nu) derived from Eqs. (2)–(4). The contours reveal progressive development patterns for local heat transfer, similar to turbulent kinetic energy and velocity field distributions, exhibiting pronounced entry effects before fully-developed regions. Commonly, the contours show that the fully-developed regions have higher local Nusselt number at region B than that at region A. The helical flow within the channel effectively transports the high-turbulence fluid to region B, where subsequent boundary layer development and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation occur along the no-slip wall, resulting in local heat transfer diminishment progressively along the y-axis. Furthermore, both DXL and TXL demonstrate significantly enhanced local Nusselt numbers compared to CXL, with endwall heat transfer performance showing positive correlation with pore density. The spiral vortex count enhances turbulent kinetic energy, while the intensified spiral transport mechanism facilitates more efficient thermal exchange between endwalls and incoming coolant the dominant mechanism governing local heat transfer variations.

Fig. 12(b) quantitatively compares the endwall thermal performance through the averaged local Nusselt number (Nue, H) for the fifth to ninth cells across all periodic cellular structures at varying Reynolds numbers, revealing that substituting RXL rectangular ligaments with circular rods diminishes its endwalls heat transfer capacity. CXL displays the lowest Nue,H values, reflecting the inferior endwall thermal performance. However, pore density optimization in CXL partially mitigates this limitation. Compared to the CXL, TXL and DXL demonstrate enhanced endwalls heat transfer coefficients, with improvements of 39.8–48.3 % and 25.6–30.3 %, respectively.
4.3.2. Local heat transfer on the lattice core
Fig. 13(a) presents the local heat transfer distributions across the lattice cores of the three matastructures, with the local Nusselt numbers calculated consistently with Fig. 12(a). Morphological variations in the lattice geometry alter the internal flow dynamics, thereby modifying core-region energy transport. The change from single-layer to multi-layer structure introduce dual spiral vortices and increases coolant mass flow rates along ligament windward surfaces. Consequently, Fig. 13(a) demonstrates markedly superior thermal performance in DXL and TXL compared to CXL. Vortex-driven mechanisms account for the observed heat transfer differentials between windward and leeward ligament surfaces, where enhanced flow blockage induces pronounced downstream separation and stronger longitudinal vortices that propagate sequentially between ligaments as shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 8. Although the first X-lattice layer maintains consistent thermal performance across all configurations due to structural similarity, regions influenced by spiral flows particularly in high pore density zones of DXL and TXL exhibit substantially improved heat transfer. These spiral flows, governed by longitudinal vortices, maximize thermal performance on windward surfaces, whereas leeward-side vortices interact minimally with downstream faces, resulting in attenuated heat transfer. The substantial heat transfer surface area within the lattice core facilitates enhanced fluid-structure thermal exchange, while the geometrically complex topologies of DXL and TXL induce greater flow obstruction that amplifies local turbulence intensity and mixing efficiency, synergistically contributing to their superior ligament core thermal performance (see Fig. 14).

Fig. 13(b) quantifies the local thermal performance within the lattice core by presenting the averaged local Nusselt numbers (Nuc,H) for the fifth to ninth cells across all periodic cellular structures at varying Reynolds numbers, revealing that TXL exhibits superior performance in terms of local Nusselt number. Notably, TXL and DXL exhibit 53–74 % and 29–39 % greater local Nusselt number than CXL, respectively. Relative to the RXL configuration, TXL and DXL demonstrate enhanced performance with improvements of 37.6–41.2 % and 9.9–19 %, respectively.
4.4. Quantification of the heat transfer enhancement mechanisms
For the three types of periodic cellular structures, the quantification of local heat exchange contributions to overall heat transfer has been specifically detailed in Refs. [37,38]. To avoid redundancy, this study does not repeat those calculations. The overall Nusselt number for the three periodic cellular structures can be expressed as [37,38]:
(28)
The contribution of enhanced heat transfer on specific surfaces (e.g., the core surface) of TXL compared to CXL to the overall heat transfer enhancement can be quantified as [37,38]:
(29)
Table 4 summarizes the C1 and C2 coefficients along with the averaged Nusselt numbers for bottom endwall, top endwall, and core surfaces across all three periodic cellular structures at the Reynolds number of 11087, while Fig. 13(a–b) quantitatively demonstrate the relative contributions of each surface to the overall thermal enhancement for DXL and TXL relative to CXL. The analysis reveals that TXL 109.5 % improvement in overall Nusselt number over CXL predominantly originates from core surface heat performance enhancement, with negligible contributions from endwall surfaces, whereas DXL exhibits a similar trend with a 59.4 % core heat performance improvement. These results demonstrate that pore density modification in TXL and DXL increases the effective core heat transfer surface area while maintaining identical porosity and ligament-specific surface area, representing one of the primary mechanisms for enhanced thermal performance.

4.5. Evaluation of the overall thermal performance
Fig. 6 demonstrates that pore density variations substantially affect both overall heat transfer and pressure drop compared to the CXL configuration. Therefore, a comparative performance evaluation under both fixed pressure drop and fixed pumping power conditions is necessary. Fig. 15 presents the correlation between the overall Nusselt number and non-dimensional pressure drop (fRe2) or pumping power (fRe3). As demonstrated in Ref. [10] and presented in the figures, the CXL has similar thermal performance to the RXL. At the fixed pressure drop condition, it reveals that the TXL exhibits a 77.8–90.9 % and 24.9–28.2 % higher overall Nusselt number than the CXL and DXL, respectively. At the fixed pumping power condition, the superiority elevates to 91.8–112 % and 51.4–60.9 %.

5. Conclusions
To enhance the thermal performance in the X-lattice periodic cellular structure, this paper numerically investigated the effects of pore density on the turbulent flow and heat transfer in single-layered, double layered and triple layered X-lattices (separately denoted as CXL, DXL and TXL), with fixing core height and porosity. Conclusions drawn in this study are summarized as follows.
(1)
For a given Reynolds number with in the range of 2692–11087, TXL achieves the best heat transfer; the overall Nusselt number of the TXL exceeds those of the DXL and CXL by 30.9–41.7 % and 118.5–163.4 %, respectively. DXL shows 66.9–85.9 % improvement in the overall Nusselt number over the CXL as well. Correspondingly, the friction factors of the TXL and DXL are 227–248 % and 109–116 % higher than that of the CXL, respectively. Both the heat transfer and pressure drop increases with the increase of pore density.
(2)
With the increase of the pore density, the primary flow within half an array of unit cells gradually changes from the single spiral flow system to the three spiral flow system. More interesting, the exits evident interactions between the adjacent spiral flows. For the DXL, the two spiral streams significantly enhance the bulk turbulence kinetic energy level mainly by reduced dissipation; the highly turbulent fluid can be effectively transported to the endwalls. For the TXL, similar intensification of the turbulence is achieved; However, the high turbulence for the middle spiral stream can not be efficiently transported to the endwalls.
(3)
Corresponding to the turbulence field, the DXL and TXL show evidently higher local Nusselt number than the CXL, with the increment as high as 39.8–48.3 % and 25.6–30.3 %, as well as 53–74 % and 29–39 %.
(4)
Mechanisms quantification demonstrates that the enhanced heat transfer is mainly attributed to the enhance local heat transfer on the ligaments and the enhanced core heat transfer area.
(5)
For a given pressure drop, TXL also achieves the best heat transfer; the overall Nusselt number of the TXL exceeds those of the DXL and CXL by 77.8–90.9 % and by 24.9–28.2 %, respectively. For a given pumping power, the overall Nusselt number of the TXL exceeds those of the DXL and CXL by 91.8–112 % and 51.4–60.9 %, respectively. Therefore, the thermal performance also increases with the increase of pore density.
