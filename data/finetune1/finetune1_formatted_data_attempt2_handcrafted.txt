Q: What are some key factors that drive growth in behind-the-meter Photo-Voltaic systems?

A: 
- Costs of Photovoltaic has fallen by 50% over the last years
- Levelized electricity costs are now below $0.16 per kWh for distributed rooftop systems in many regions 
- State and federal subsidies improve the private economics of PV, for example, the federal investment tax credit, which covers up to 30% of installation costs
- Net-metering policies, where utilities pay customers for hourly energy production that exceeds their consumption, require utility companies to purchase excess distributed solar PV production at retail rates.

Q: What properties of EMGRAs could potentially assist with optimizing anchorage design in rock mass engineering?

A: 
- Experimental increase of > 50% pull-out resistance of EMTRAs compared to OM-grouted anchors
- Improved tensile and bending effects and more effective mobilization of the rebar's tensile capacity
- Improved slip resistance and enlarged mortar damage zone due to rebars rib induced scraping action

Q:  What properties make the piston–cylinder liner pair one of the most failure-prone components in heavy-duty diesel engines?

A: 
- The piston crown is exposed to combustion gases > 2000 °C
- The sliding contact between the piston rings and the liner wall reaches 300 - 400 °C
- The liner must withstand explosion pressures over 10 MPa and high-frequency reciprocating inertial forces
- Carbon deposits and acidic oxides generated during combustion corrode the contact surfaces
- Lubricating oil film may rupture under heavy loads, leading to boundary or even dry friction

Q: What primary factors contribute to crankshaft failure in diesel engines?

A: 
- Excessive bending vibrations due to imbalance
- The absence of a proper balancing system
- Inadequate lubrication between the bearings and journals
- High combustion pressures within the cylinders
- Manufacturing defects, particularly in the fillet regions of the crankpin-web and main journal-web transitions
