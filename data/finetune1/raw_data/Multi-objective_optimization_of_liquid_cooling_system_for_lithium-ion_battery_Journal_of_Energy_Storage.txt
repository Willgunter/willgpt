Abstract
The battery thermal management system is critical for the lifespan and safety of lithium-ion batteries. This study presents the design of a liquid cooling system with asymmetric flow channels. To achieve optimal overall performance, a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework is proposed to optimize the system parameters. The numerical model of the liquid cooling system is developed and validated. The ranges of the optimization variables are determined through the single-factor analysis. The errors of the RSM, Kriging and RBF surrogate models are compared, and the RSM surrogate model is selected due to highest accuracy. The global sensitivity analysis is performed using the Sobol method to identify the optimization variables that significantly affect the system performance. With the maximum temperature (Tmax), maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax), and pressure drop (Δp) as optimization objectives, the mass flow rate (Vc), channel length (l), and coolant temperature (Tc) as optimization variables, the multi-objective optimization function is established, and the NSGA-II algorithm is employed to solve the function. Three distinct weighting strategies is carried out to explore the effect of different weight combinations on the optimization results, including sole weight, equal weight, and entropy weight. The TOPSIS and LINMAP methods are employed to select the optimal solution from the Pareto front. The results show that both the entropy weight-TOPSIS and entropy weight-LINMAP methods achieved the same effect. Compared with the initial design, the optimal design reduces the Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp by 5.90 %, −0.78 % and 7.20 % respectively. The multi-objective optimization framework proposed in this study could provide a reference for the battery thermal management system and other fields.

1. Introduction
The transportation sector requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions [1], electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit considerable potential [2]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in EVs because of their advantages, such as high energy density, high power density, low self-discharge rate, and long cycle life [3]. However, the performance of LIBs is highly susceptible to temperature variations. Extreme temperatures can lead to capacity degradation [4,5], shortened cycle life [6,7], and even thermal runaway [8]. Moreover, temperature disparities within battery packs may result in inconsistent aging rates among individual cells. Specifically, when the temperature difference exceeds 5 °C, the capacity of the battery pack may decline by 1.5 % to 2 % [9]. It is imperative to maintain the temperature of LIBs within the range of 25–40 °C, and control the temperature difference within 5 °C [10]. Thus, an effective battery thermal management system (BTMS) is crucial for enhancing LIBs performance.
Current BTMS mainly adopts the type of air cooling [11], liquid cooling [12], phase change material (PCM) cooling [13], heat pipe cooling [14], and hybrid cooling [15,16]. Among these, the type of liquid cooling is widely utilized because of its high specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity [17]. Liquid cooling systems can be categorized into direct and indirect cooling systems. The performance of indirect cooling systems is affected by several factors, including the type, temperature, and flow rate of the coolant, as well as the structure and arrangement of the cooling plates. Recent studies have substantially enhanced the performance of liquid cooling systems by utilizing novel coolants and optimizing the structure and arrangement of cooling plates [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]].
To further enhance the comprehensive performance of liquid cooling systems, it is essential to optimize the parameters influencing the system performance. Wang et al. [23] employed the orthogonal testing to analyze the effects of different factors on the heat dissipation performance and determined the sensitivity of each factor for multi-objective optimization. Guo et al. [24] utilized the gray relational analysis to determine the correlation degree between various factors and evaluation indicators, and constructed a multi-objective optimization function. Huang et al. [25] and Zhang et al. [26] established Kriging-based high-dimensional models, and selected the factors with high sensitivity as the optimization factors by using the global sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method. Li et al. [27] established multiple surrogate models and selected the best model for multi-objective optimization after evaluating accuracy. Wang et al. [28] constructed a particle swarm optimization-support vector machine model, and screened the optimal solution in the Pareto optimal solution set by linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods. Deng et al. [29] utilized the Latin hypercube method for sampling and constructed a response surface surrogate model for the multi-objective optimization. Shi et al. [30] used the entropy weight-TOPSIS method to identify the optimal design among 625 candidates. Wu et al. [31] proposed a secondary optimization strategy based on the entropy weight-TOPSIS method to select optimal structures for different optimization objectives. Table 1 summarizes the multi-objective optimization frameworks of the aforementioned literature.

In summary, the optimization process of BTMS includes optimization variable selection, surrogate model development, optimization algorithm solution, and optimal solution determination. Current researches focus on certain procedures of the multi-objective optimization but neglect the development of a comprehensive optimization framework. To address this situation, a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework has been developed in this study to enhance the design efficiency of the battery thermal management system, which integrates the entire processes from the optimization variable selection to the optimal solution determination. Furthermore, this study has comprehensively explored the effect of different weight strategies and decision-making methods on the optimization results, and contrastively analysed the effectiveness of these methods based on the same subject. This study could provide a systemic solutions and reference for the optimization of the battery thermal management system.
2. Model and validation
2.1. Geometric model
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the overall structure of the battery module exhibits the arrangement of LIBs positioned between two cooling plates. Specifically, the battery module comprises three LIBs and four liquid cooling plates (LCPs), labeled consecutively from left to right as Plate1, Plate2, Plate3, and Plate4. The coolant flow directions within adjacent LCPs are opposite to each other. The gaps between the LCPs and batteries are filled with thermal conductive material (TCM), as depicted in Fig. 1 (b). The number of flow channel turns within Plate1, Plate2, Plate3, and Plate4 is 2, 4, 4, and 2, respectively. Given the symmetry of the flow channels, only two distinct internal flow channel configurations of the LCPs are presented in Fig. 1 (c) and Fig. 1 (d). The structural parameters of the liquid cooling system are summarized in Table 2, while the thermal physical properties of the respective materials are outlined in Table 3.

2.2. Governing equations
The conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy of the coolant in the LCPs are illustrated as follows [32],
(1)
(2)
(3)
Where ρw, cw, kw, Tw, 
 and p are the density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, temperature, velocity vector and static pressure of the coolant, respectively.
The frictional head loss of the incompressible viscous fluid flowing steadily in a rough channel can be expressed by the Darcy-Weisbach equation [22].
(4)
(5)
Where hf is frictional head loss, λ is frictional head coefficient, for laminar flow λ = 64/Re, and for turbulent flow, λ can be found in the moody figure. l is the length of the channel, d is the equivalent diameter, v is velocity of the coolant. g is the gravitational acceleration.
(6)
Where hj is the local resistance loss, ξ is the local resistance loss coefficient.
The total loss is equal to the sum of all hf and hj.
(7)
Therefore, the pressure drop in the channel can be expressed by the following equation.
(8)
The energy conservation equations of LIBs, LCPs and TCM are as follows,
(9)
(10)
(11)
where b, lcp and tcm represent LIB, LCP and TCM, respectively. Qv is the heat generation rate of the LIB.
According to the Bernardi heat generation model [33], the heat generated by the LIB is mainly composed of irreversible heat and reversible heat, and the heat generation model can be given by,
(12)

where Ta is the ambient temperature, h is the heat transfer coefficient.
2.3. Boundary condition
The inlet and outlet of the coolant are mass flow inlet and pressure outlet respectively. The initial temperature of LIBs, coolant and ambient temperature are 25 °C respectively. The convective heat transfer coefficient of the outer surface of the battery module is 5 W⋅m−2⋅K−1 [20]. The thermal radiation and the thermal resistance between LCPs and LIBs are disregarded in this study.
The flow type of coolant is determined by utilizing the Reynolds number, which is calculated using the following formula [22]:
(14)
where μ is the viscosity of the coolant.
In this study, the maximum mass flow rate is 1.8 g⋅s−1 and the minimum channel cross-sectional area is 4 × 5 mm2. The Reynolds number is calculated to be 450, which is <2300. Therefore, the flow state of the coolant is laminar.

The internal resistance, entropy heat coefficient, and temperature rise of the batteries were measured through experimentation. The experimental equipment comprises a temperature transmission module, PT100 temperature sensors, a thermostat, a computer, and a battery test system, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Five temperature sensors were evenly attached to the LIB surface. Sensors 1 to 3 are positioned on the front of the LIB and sensors 4 to 5 are positioned on the back.

2.5. Grid independent test
The polyhedral grid configuration was adopted for the grid division of the overall model. Three layers of prismatic grids were established between the coolant and the solid material, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). Five different mesh models were employed to conduct the grid independent test. Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp were used to assess the independence of the grid quantity. The effect of varying grid quantities on the computational results is depicted in Fig. 4(b). When the grid quantity increased to 998,841, Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp increased by 0.0149 %, 1.157 %, and 0.005 %, respectively. Considering both computational accuracy and cost, a grid quantity of 998,841 was ultimately selected for subsequent simulations.

The maximum relative error value is 2.59 %, which occurred at the end of the 3C discharge. Therefore, the model is suitable for subsequent simulation analyses due to a high accuracy.

3.1. Construction of the surrogate model
Before constructing the surrogate model, sample points must be obtained through experimental design. Common experimental design methods include Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) [29], optimal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS) [35], Box–Behnken design (BBD) [24], central composite design (CCD) [36], and orthogonal experimental design [28]. OLHS was chose for sampling in this study because OLHS could ensure the spatial filling, uniformity and randomness.
Surrogate models primarily include response surface methodology (RSM) [29], radial basis function (RBF) networks [24] and Kriging model [25]. Different surrogate models may exhibit varying predictive accuracies depending on the type of data. The predictive capabilities of RSM, RBF and Kriging can be evaluated by comparing the prediction errors of each model with the same test set. The model with the lowest error would be selected for subsequent optimization to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the optimization process.
Although the RSM model performs excellently with simple nonlinear problems, it may not adequately capture all nonlinear characteristics of highly complex systems. The relationship between input variables and the objective function of RSM is described as follows [29],
(18)
Where yRSM is the approximate value of the response, α0, αi, βi, μi, ηi, βij are undetermined coefficients.
The RBF model performs well in many problems because of the flexibility, particularly in cases of sparse data. The RBF model is a neural network model that employs radial basis functions as activation functions. Assuming the hidden layer comprises n hidden nodes and the output layer has m output nodes, and the activation function is the Gaussian function, the expression of RBF can be formulated as follows [24],
(19)
Where wij is the weight of the i-th neuron node in the hidden layer to the j-th node in the output layer, xp is the p-th input sample, ci is the centroid of the i-th neuron in the hidden layer, σ is the width of the Gaussian function, n is the number of nodes in the hidden layer; m is the number of output samples.
The Kriging model has significant advantages in dealing with nonlinear and complex problems, and can provide uncertainty estimates. However, its high computational cost may be a limiting factor when dealing with large-scale datasets. The relationship between input variables and objective function of Kriging is described as follows [25],
(20)
Where f T(x) is the basis function of the regression model, β is the undetermined parameter of the basis function, z(x) is a random function of deviation.
To evaluate the accuracy of different surrogate models, the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) were adopted as evaluation indexes. The calculation formulas for each evaluation indexes are as follows:
(21)
(22)
(23)
Where y is the result of numerical calculation,
is the prediction result of the surrogate model, 
is the average value of CFD calculation result, n is the number of sample points.
When R2 is close to 1, and MAE and RMSE are close to 0, the surrogate model has high fitting accuracy.
3.2. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
To determine the parameters that influence the comprehensive performance of liquid cooling systems, the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was implemented to assess the sensitivity of various factors by using the Sobol method. The Sobol method decomposes the variance of the model's output into different contribution parts of individual input parameters and their interactions based on the principle of variance decomposition, thereby the influence degree of each parameter and its interactions on the model's output can be quantified. The output of the Sobol sensitivity analysis comprises first-order sensitivity indices, second-order sensitivity indices, and total sensitivity indices. The first-order sensitivity index represents the effect of the i-th input parameter on the model's output by oneself. The second-order sensitivity index represents the effect of the interaction between the i-th and j-th parameters on the model's output. The total sensitivity index represents the overall effect of the i-th parameter on the model's output, including the effect of the i-th input parameter by oneself and the effect of the interaction with other parameters [37]. The model's output is expressed as Eq. (24).
(24)
Where Y is the output of the surrogate model, i.e. Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp. x = (X1,X2, …,Xk) are the parameters to be optimized.
f (X) can be decomposed as [38]:
(25)
Thus, the decomposition of the variance can be expressed as:
(26)
Where Vi、Vij and V1,2, …, k are the variances of fi、fij and f1,2, …, k, respectively.
The sensitivity index can be expressed as Eqs. (27), (28), (29).
(27)
(28)
(29)
Where Si is the first-order sensitivity index, Sij is the second-order sensitivity index, STi is the total-order sensitivity index, V-i is the sum of all variances except Vi.
3.3. Multi-objective optimization algorithm
In this study, Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are selected as the optimization objectives. Consequently, the multi-objective optimization function is formulated as:
(30)
 
The value range of the optimization parameters is presented in Table 6. The NSGA-II algorithm possesses advantages such as fast computational speed and robustness [39], hence the NSGA-II is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization function.

3.4. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods
Three weight strategies and two decision methods are carried out to explore the effect of different weight combinations and decision methods on the optimization results. The weight strategies include sole weight for single objective (OW), equal weight (SW) for three optimization objectives, and entropy weight (EW) for three optimization objectives. The decision methods include the TOPSIS method and the LINMAP method.
The formula of the entropy weight method is shown as follows [30].
(1)
The initial matrix X = (xij)n×m

Where n and m are different evaluation objects and evaluation indexes, respectively, i = 1, 2, …, n; j = 1, 2, …, m.

(44)
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Single-factor analysis
The parameters that affect the thermal performance and pressure drop of the liquid cooling system include mass flow rate (Vc), channel length (l), and coolant temperature (Tc). The single-factor analysis method was adopted to determine the value ranges of these optimization variables. The variation trends of the Tmax, ΔTmax, and Δp were observed when one parameter value was changed and the others were constant. The initial values of Vc, l, and Tc were 1.0 g⋅s−1, 12 mm, and 25 °C, respectively. The single-factor analysis was conducted under a 3C discharge rate.
Fig. 7(a) illustrates the simulation results when Vc ranges from 0.2 g⋅s−1 to 1.8 g⋅s−1. As Vc increases, Tmax gradually decreases. Specifically, Tmax decreases by 6.88 °C when Vc increases from 0.2 g⋅s−1 to 1.0 g⋅s−1, while Tmax decreases by 1.95 °C when Vc increases from 1.0 g⋅s−1 to 1.8 g⋅s−1. The cooling effect diminishes with the increase of Vc due to the limited heat exchange capacity of the coolant. The variation trend of ΔTmax is similar to that of Tmax. As Vc increases, Δp gradually rises. The increase of the flow velocity in the channel lead to the increase of frictional and local losses. It's noteworthy that ΔTmax exceeds 5 °C when Vc is <0.6 g⋅s−1. Conversely, Δp continuously increases, but Tmax and ΔTmax slowly decreases when Vc exceeds 1.4 g⋅s−1. Therefore, the value ranges of the mass flow rate for subsequent optimization is 0.6 g⋅s−1 to 1.4 g⋅s−1.

Fig. 7(b) illustrates the simulation results when l ranges from 5 mm to 15 mm. As l increases, Tmax gradually decreases. Specifically, Tmax decreases by 0.88 °C when l increases from 5 mm to 15 mm. As l increases, ΔTmax increases. The increase of contact area between the cooling plate and coolant lead to the rapid decrease of the temperature at the LIB's surface. However, the internal heat cannot be transferred to the surface promptly due to the low thermal conductivity in the y-direction, which leads to an increase of ΔTmax. Conversely, Δp continuously decreases as l increases. Therefore, the value ranges of the channel length for subsequent optimization is 5 mm to15mm.
Fig. 7(c) illustrates the simulation results when Tc ranges from 23 °C to 27 °C. As Tc increases, Tmax gradually increases, but ΔTmax gradually decreases. The heat exchange capacity is reduced due to higher coolant temperatures, then the amount of heat absorbed from the LIB decreases. As Tc increases, Δp is constant. The change of coolant temperature do not affect frictional and local losses. Therefore, the value ranges of the coolant temperature for subsequent optimization is 23 °C to 27 °C.
In summary, the value ranges of optimization variables are outlined in Table 6.
4.2. Surrogate model validation
A total of 125 sample points were drawn within the sampling range by utilizing the OLHS method and divided into a training set (the first 100 sample points) and a testing set (the last 25 sample points) with a ratio of 0.8:0.2. The training set was employed to train the surrogate models, while the testing set was employed to calculate the errors of the surrogate models. Fig. 8 illustrates the uniform distribution of the 125 sample points within the sampling range. Table 7 presents the simulation results of Tmax, ΔTmax, and Δp for the 125 sample points under the discharge rate of 3C. Fig. 9 visually demonstrates the predictive performance of three surrogate models with the testing set. The RSM surrogate model exhibits superior prediction performance compared with the RBF and Kriging surrogate models. The MAE and RMSE values are 0.5413 and 0.7101, respectively. Therefore, the RSM surrogate model was selected for subsequent multi-objective optimization.

Fig. 10. (a) first-order sensitivity index and total sensitivity index with the output of Tmax, (b) second-order sensitivity index with the output of Tmax; (c) first-order sensitivity index and total sensitivity index with the output of ΔTmax, (d) second-order sensitivity index with the output of ΔTmax; (e) first-order sensitivity index and total sensitivity index with the output of Δp, (f) second-order sensitivity index with the output of Δp.

As depicted in Fig. 10(a), Vc has the most significant effect on Tmax, and Tc has the second significant effect on Tmax, while l has the least effect on Tmax. As depicted in Fig. 10(c), Vc has the most significant effect on ΔTmax, and Tc has the second significant effect on ΔTmax, while l has the least effect on ΔTmax. As depicted in Fig. 10(e), l has the most significant effect on Δp, and Vc has the second significant effect on Δp, while l nearly has no effect on Δp. This is attributed to that the effect of coolant temperature changes on the firictional head and local resistance losses is negligible. Notably, the total sensitivity indexes of Tmax, ΔTmax, and Δp are relatively close to their first-order sensitivity indexes, which indicates that the interaction between Vc, l, and Tc is weak.
It is evident that Vc, l, and Tc exert varying effect on the three optimization objectives through sensitivity analysis. Hence, it is imperative to identify the optimal combination of these variables to achieve superior overall performance of the liquid cooling system.
4.4. Multi-objective optimization
The solution parameters of the NSGA-II algorithm are shown in Table 8.
Table 8. Solution parameters of the NSGA-II algorithm.

Parameter	Value
Size of population	500
Number of samples per iteration	500
The maximum number of iterations	200
Crossover probability	0.8
Mutation probability	0.1
Maximum allowable Pareto percentage	30
The Pareto optimal solution set is depicted in Fig. 11, which comprises 150 non-dominated solutions. In order to select the optimal solution from this Pareto set, three weighting combinations were contrasted and the TOPSIS and LINMAP methods were utilized to rank the 150 solutions, respectively. The weighting combination calculated by the entropy weight method is presented in Table 9. The weights of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are 0.2635, 0.2569, and 0.4796 respectively.

The results corresponding to different weights and decision methods are illustrated in Fig. 11, and the specific data is presented in Table 10. The corresponding optimal solution of the EW - TOPSIS is Vc = 1.2071 g∙s−1, l = 14.6847 mm and Tc = 23.6594 °C. The corresponding values of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are 32.9858 °C, 4.1845 °C, and 27.5096 Pa, respectively. The optimal solution obtained by the EW - LINMAP is consistent with the result by the EW - TOPSIS.

The corresponding optimal solution of the SW - TOPSIS is Vc = 1.3610 g∙s−1, l = 14.2449 mm and Tc = 23.1050 °C. The corresponding values of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are 32.2217 °C, 4.0604 °C, and 32.8058 Pa, respectively. The corresponding optimal solution of the SW - LINMAP is Vc = 1.3502 g∙s−1, l = 14.2797 mm and Tc = 23.4257 °C. The corresponding values of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are 32.4487 °C, 4.0522 °C, and 34.4590 Pa, respectively. The corresponding Tmax of the SW - TOPSIS is lower than that of the SW - LINMAP, while the corresponding ΔTmax and Δp of the SW - TOPSIS is higher than that of the SW - LINMAP. The result difference between the two method is relatively small.
When the Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are used as the single objective respectively, the corresponding values of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are 32.0859 °C, 3.7512 °C, and 12.4565 Pa, respectively. The results of single objective could be used for comparison with the results of multi-objective optimization.
To validate the accuracy of the optimal solution presented in Table 10, the errors of the optimal solutions were calculated. As depicted in Fig. 12, the relative errors of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp are all within 5 %, thus the proposed multi-objective optimization method and its outcomes are reliable and valid.

Fig. 12. Relative error results for the optimal solution.

Table 11 presents the simulation data of Tmax, ΔTmax and Δp under the condition of the initial design and the optimal solution. Fig. 13 illustrates the improvement of the optimal solution compared to the initial design. Both the Tmax values of EW solution and SW solution decrease compared with the initial design. Notably, the ΔTmax values of EW solution increases, while the Δp values of EW solution decreases compared with the initial design. In contrast, the ΔTmax values of SW solution decreases, while the Δp values of SW solution increases compared with the initial design. It needs to be emphasized that the increase of ΔTmax values does not exceed 5 °C, and the increase is slight compared with the initial design. In summary, the results screened by EW-TOPSIS and EW-LINMAP are finally selected as the optimal design in this study. Compared with the initial design, Tmax and Δp decreased by 5.90 %, 7.20 %, respectively, while ΔTmax increased by 0.78 %.

In summary, varying weights and decision-making methods exert distinct effects on the ultimate optimal solution. As an objective weighting approach, the entropy weight method could effectively determine the weight of the optimization objective. It must be acknowledged that the entropy weight method solely relies on the information entropy within the Pareto optimal solution set to reflect the disparities and significance of the optimization objective, which may result in deviations between the calculated weights and actual design objectives. However, in the absence of specific optimization objective weights, the weights derived from the entropy weight method may serve as a valuable reference. In practical engineering applications, if the optimization objectives fall within a reasonable range, the weight values of specific objectives could be elevated to achieve the desired results, as exemplified in references [24,27].
5. Conclusions
This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework for liquid cooling systems. The mass flow rate (Vc), channel length (l), and coolant temperature (Tc) are used as optimization variables. The maximum temperature (Tmax), maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax) and pressure drop (Δp) are used as optimization objectives. The optimal solution is obtained by using the entropy weight method and the TOPSIS method. The key findings are summarized as follows:
(1)
As the Vc increases, the Δp increases, while the Tmax and the ΔTmax decreases. As the l increases, the Tmax and Δp decrease, while the ΔTmax increases. As the Tc increases, the Tmax increases, while the ΔTmax decreases, and the Δp holds constant. The value ranges of Vc, l and Tc are 0.6 to 1.4 g⋅s−1, 5 to 15 mm, and 23 to 27 °C, respectively.
(2)
The RSM, Kriging and RBF surrogate models exhibit low errors when they predict Tmax and ΔTmax. However, the RSM surrogate model exhibits the smallest error when they predict Δp. Based on these results, the RSM surrogate model is chosen for subsequent optimization.
(3)
The Vc has a significant effect on Tmax and ΔTmax, while its effect on Δp is relatively small. The l has a lesser effect on Tmax and ΔTmax, while its effect on Δp is significant. The Tc has a significant effect on Tmax, and a minor effect on ΔTmax, while no effect on Δp.
(4)
The optimal solutions screened by the entropy weights method show a decreasing trend in Tmax, Δp. And the increase of ΔTmax is slight. The results screened by the EW-TOPSIS and EW-LINMAP methods are finally selected as the optimal design in this study. Compared with the initial design, Tmax and Δp decreased by 5.90 %, and 7.20 %, respectively, while ΔTmax increased by 0.78 %.
