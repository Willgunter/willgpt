1. Introduction
Recent years have seen growing interest in novel approaches and applications of phase change materials (PCMs) in solar energy systems [1]. These materials store and release thermal energy via latent heat, enabling controlled thermal management for uses such as renewable energy storage and refrigeration. Applications in solar thermal power plants, solar air and water heaters, and solar cookers have been extensively reported [2], [3], demonstrating the practical potential of latent heat storage across a range of devices.
Numerous numerical and experimental studies have characterized melting behavior and heat transfer in phase-change media confined within enclosures of various geometries, which are common in thermal energy storage systems [4]. For example, Oliveski et al. [5] examined melting in a rectangular cavity heated on one side and insulated on the others, showing that horizontal partial fins can reduce overall melting time and increase total heat transfer while decreasing the surface-averaged Nusselt number. Izadi et al. [6] numerically investigated charging in a grid of small, thermally conducting, impermeable cells and found that such subdivision can suppress convective circulation and thus prolong charging time.
Annular and spherical configurations have also been studied to probe the interplay between conduction and buoyancy-driven convection. Longeon et al. [7] used an annular heat-exchanger geometry with visualized melting/solidification fronts and emphasized the importance of natural convection during charging. Yuan et al. [8] reported that fin orientation in annular units can inhibit convection yet still increase melting rates by enlarging the heat-exchange area. In spherical capsules, experimental and numerical work by [9] and [10] showed that transient melting is strongly affected by thermal and geometric parameters (e.g., temperature difference, shell diameter): after an initial diffusion-dominated phase, buoyancy enhances melting in the upper region while more complex interface shapes appear below.
Common heat sources in the literature include resistive heaters, convective heating, and solar radiation. Studies under artificial solar or infrared sources [11], [12] show how fins or internal wires modify melting times; for instance, experiments without fins reported complete melting after 199 min under 800 
. Zhang et al. [13] used a spotlight (
), to evaluate a microthermal storage element coupled to a thermoelectric generator, highlighting the need for careful source calibration and showing that latent storage can smooth sensitivity to solar fluctuations.
Despite comprehensive reviews on PCM materials and latent heat storage, most experimental and numerical investigations assume quasi-uniform heating or bulk convective sources. Recent studies that address non-uniform or discrete heating reveal important departures from uniform-heating behavior: Srikanth and Balaji [14] showed that spatially discrete heat sources generate hotspots that strongly affect melting/solidification cycles in PCM-based heat sinks; Tamuli et al. [15] demonstrated that temperature fluctuating heat sources (representative of solar collector output) change the balance between convection and conduction and can lead to the re-emergence of conduction-dominated regimes; numerical analyses of radiant heating systems with PCM (e.g., González and Prieto [16]) highlight how radiative distribution and band placement alter charge–discharge dynamics; and recent experimental–numerical work on transport phenomena during phase change [17] emphasizes the complexity of convective patterns and interface morphology induced by localized forcing. Together, these findings indicate that spatially localized irradiation or discrete heating can produce distinct buoyancy-driven flows and asymmetric interface evolution not captured by uniform heating models, which motivates the present combined experimental–numerical study.
The use of radiation — particularly spatially localized radiation — as the primary heat source for latent thermal storage has received relatively little attention. Most experimental studies apply quasi-uniform heating or use bulk convective sources, leaving open questions about how localized irradiance alters melting dynamics, convective patterns, and temperature fields at the scale of practical devices.
In this study we address that gap by investigating localized radiation as the heat source for a phase-change medium using combined experimental and numerical analyses in a Hele-Shaw cell configuration. Our primary objective is to elucidate how a confined, localized radiative input modifies melting rates, interface evolution, and the temperature distribution relative to more uniform heating conditions. The experiments provide time-resolved visualization and temperature measurements, while the numerical model solves the conservation equations described in Section 2. We discuss the results in Section 3, and conclusions and practical implications are given in Section 4.
2. Problem formulation
2.1. Experimental setup
The most efficient method for storing solar energy in PCMs is direct exposure, which minimizes energy conversion steps before reaching the PCM. However, direct sunlight exposure introduces challenges due to daily fluctuations in solar radiation, leading to inconsistent energy absorption rates. To address this, our experiment employs an incandescent light source to simulate a controlled radiation environment.
The Hele-Shaw cell configuration enables direct observation of heat transfer dynamics during phase change. Thermal imaging provides non-intrusive measurements of the temperature field, while the vertical orientation highlights gravitational stratification and convective effects. By exposing the system to localized radiation, this setup emulates non-uniform heat flux conditions analogous to those in solar concentrators (e.g., parabolic troughs or Fresnel systems). Unlike bulk PCM storage, small-scale systems often exhibit stratification—a behavior replicated here to isolate the roles of conduction, convection, and radiation in phase-change processes.
Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup consisting of a phase change material (paraffin wax) in a Hele-Shaw cell. This cell, measuring 30 cm × 30 cm, consists of two glass plates with a gap that holds a paraffin sheet with a thickness of 0.2 cm. One side of the cell is illuminated with a 250 W incandescent light source through a screen that restricts radiation to a central circular area measuring 3.81 cm in diameter.
The paraffin was heated in a container on a Thermo Scientific 350 W hot plate until melted for deposition between the glass plates. A summary of paraffin’s thermal properties is included in Table 1 for reference. Further information about thermophysical properties of paraffin and other PCMs can be found in [18], [19]. Before deposition, the glass sheets were preheated with a heat gun to prevent solidification upon contact. The molten paraffin was carefully deposited onto the glass surfaces, and pressure clamps were subsequently applied to secure the assembly. The paraffin within the Hele-Shaw cell was fully remelted by using a heat gun to eliminate air bubbles. This process enables the formation of a uniform, gravity-driven layer.

We placed the cell at approximately 13 cm from the light source to achieve an irradiance of approximately 1000

The main experimental procedure consists of two parts: (i) analysis of the melting curve, and (ii) analysis of the solidification (cooling) curve. Each test lasts 90 min. Five-minute intervals were used to measure temperature during melting and solidification. Temperature measurements were taken using a Fluke Ti 401 PRO thermal camera. This camera features a high-resolution detector with a 320 × 240 pixel resolution and an emissivity corrector, ensuring accurate temperature readings. The minimum focus distance is 15 cm, and it can measure temperatures from −20 °C to +650 °C with an error of ±2 °C. The emissivity and distance values were set to 0.9 and 40 cm, respectively.
2.2. Governing equations
In general, phase changes involve the solution of the Stefan problem. [20]. In this case, the melting/solidification front is treated as a time-dependent boundary condition, with the front position unknown. The numerical solution of this problem is not trivial and requires moving boundaries and deformable meshes. An alternative solution is the enthalpy method [21], [22], where the energy equation is written in terms of enthalpy rather than temperature. Here, we take advantage of the fact that, during the phase change process, the enthalpy change is constant and equal to the latent heat. Knowing the phase-change temperatures, the melting front will be a step function of the enthalpy change. The main advantage of this method is that the phase change front is not explicitly tracked, avoiding issues related to the mesh implementation.
The model consists of a two-dimensional representation of the Hele-Shaw cell. To include convection effects, the gravity term is added in the vertical direction of the momentum equation. The volume expansion of the PCM is approximated as a linear variation of density using the Boussinesq approximation. For the phase change process, the enthalpy formulation is employed to represent the latent heat. The model is based on the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations. The system is assumed to be incompressible, and the paraffin is considered a Newtonian fluid with constant thermophysical properties, as shown in Table 1. The external heat source is modeled as a volumetric heat generation term in the energy conservation equation. The governing equations are given by:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where 
 represents the fluid’s velocity, 
 is the PCM’s density, 
 denotes its kinematic viscosity, 
 the pressure, 
 the gravity acceleration, and 
 denotes thermal conductivity. The total enthalpy 
, is given by:
(4)
where the sensible heat capacity, or sensible enthalpy, 
 is defined as
(5)
where 
 is the specific heat at constant pressure, and the enthalpy change (
) depends linearly on the latent heat as 
; 
 is the liquid fraction and can be computed by the step function:
(6)
The term 
 in Eq. (2) is a source term from the Darcy law that describes the effects of convection in the phase change process given by
(7)
where 
 is a constant that is related to the mushy zone of the phase transition process. This value is in the range 
 for paraffin [23].
The heat source term in Eq. (3) is modeled as a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution [24], emulating the radiation of the lightbulb. The effect of convective cooling was considered during the melting process, as the cell is a surface in the ambient. For solidification, only the convective cooling is considered. The heat source term is given by:
(8)
where 
 is the light source intensity and 
 is a constant related to the area covered by the light source, 
 is a volumetric heat transfer coefficient of the whole cell with the air. These values were adjusted by trial and error, comparing the intensity and area with experimental data from pure heat conduction. The volumetric heat transfer coefficient was adjusted by comparing the experimental solidification rate with the numerical solidification.
The boundary conditions are set at room temperature 
 for the temperature and no-slip boundary condition for the velocity.
2.3. Numerical methodology
The Hele-Shaw cell system described in Section 2 was modeled numerically as a 2D sheet with the following assumptions:
1.
Flow simplification: two-dimensional flow with negligible wall effects (validated by the high aspect ratio of the cell).
2.
Phase-change modeling: enthalpy method to track melting/solidification without interface-tracking meshes.
3.
Material properties: Thermophysical properties from Table 1 held constant except for density, treated via the Boussinesq approximation.
4.
Boundary conditions: thermal boundaries fixed at ambient temperature (volumetric cooling dominates). For the velocity is no-slip. The gravity field is aligned with the 
-direction.
5.
Heat source: Gaussian radiative flux (Eq. (8)) emulating localized irradiation.
The domain for the simulations considers a 30 × 30 cm mashed with uniform quadrilateral elements. The governing equations (1)–(3) and boundary conditions described in the previous section are solved numerically using the finite volume software ANSYS Fluent [25]. A pressure-based model is used for the solutions. In the 
 direction, the natural convection caused by the buoyancy force is considered. A user-specified function is used to compute the external heat source 
. The boundaries of the computational domain are set at a temperature of 
, the same as the initial ambient temperature of 
. The values of the convergence residuals are fixed at 10−6, for the momentum, and 10−9, for the energy. A domain of 200 × 200 elements is used for the mesh. The time step is fixed at 0.05 s.
A grid convergence analysis is performed, evaluating the temperature on a central line for three different mesh sizes: 
, 
, and 
, squared elements. As we can observe in Fig. 2, the difference between temperature profiles in the medium and fine meshes is small, and the computation time is reduced using the medium mesh.

3. Results and discussion
In the Hele-Shaw configuration, the flow is predominantly two-dimensional. Experimental observations (see Fig. 3) reveal three distinct zones: (1) a circular inner zone dominated by radiative heat transfer, (2) an intermediate zone governed by convection, and (3) an outer zone characterized by conductive heat dissipation and convective cooling.
The liquid fraction in the experimental images was determined by thresholding the temperature data based on the melting and solidification temperatures of paraffin. This approach enables the identification of the phase change front and the quantification of the liquid fraction over time.

Fig. 3. Heat transfer zones observed during the experiment: Radiation, convection, and conduction.

Fig. 4 depicts the experimental temperature contours and liquid fraction evolution during the paraffin melting process. Initially, melting occurs only in the confined area under incident radiation. As shown in Figs. 4-(a) and (g), a small circular liquid pool forms after 15 min of irradiation, with negligible convection effects at this stage. As time evolves, the temperature rises, and the melted zone expands into adjacent cell regions. After 40 min, convection becomes pronounced: buoyancy-driven flow causes the hotter liquid to rise, inducing further melting of the surrounding PCM and deforming the interface into an elliptical shape. The melting front evolves asymmetrically due to this interplay of conduction and convection. The experimental melting process concludes within 90 min. Beyond this time, the paraffin temperature surpasses its maximum operational limit, risking material degradation.
Fig. 5 depicts the solidification process of the PCM, showing the experimental temperature contours and liquid fraction. The process begins immediately after the light source is turned off. Heat is removed from the cell solely through convective cooling to the surrounding environment. While the fluid within the convection cell remains hot, the solidification process initiates at the bottom and propagates upward as it cools. The convection zone gradually shrinks to a small area. Finally, although the paraffin is fully solidified, it continues to cool gradually, approaching thermal equilibrium with the environment.

Fig. 6 presents the temperature distribution and liquid fraction derived from the numerical solution. Elevated temperatures are concentrated within a localized circular zone of the cell, corresponding to the region where paraffin initiates melting. Consistent with experimental observations, the solid material surrounding the hot fluid undergoes heating and melting in alignment with convective flow patterns. Once a portion of the paraffin has melted, convection becomes the dominant heat transfer mechanism, accelerating the phase transition process.
The simulated temperature distribution and liquid fraction evolution during solidification are displayed in Fig. 7. Solidification occurs vertically from bottom to top within the cell, in agreement with experimental results. Interestingly, the PCM in the top region can continue to melt neighboring solid material for a few minutes after the external heat source has been turned off. Gradual solidification occurs as heat is removed from the cell via convective cooling. As convective heat transfer decreases beyond 120 min, the paraffin transitions into a mushy region before completely solidifying.

In addition to temperature and liquid fraction fields, velocity fields were analyzed. Fig. 8 illustrates velocity magnitude contours during melting (top row) and solidification (bottom row). Convection dominates the melting phase: a small convective cell forms at 30 min and propagates upward as paraffin melts. Higher velocities occur at the solid–liquid interface, where restricted flow forces hot fluid to recirculate, shaping the elliptical melting front. During solidification, heat diffusion initiates at the cell’s base, while convection persists in the upper region. Flow in the lower section is constrained by solidified material, suppressing mixing and creating a cold zone where solidification begins. Velocity fields diminish before complete solidification, vanishing entirely as the mushy zone transitions to a fully solid state.

The experimental and numerical results generally show similar behavior. The melting process is non-uniform due to convective effects, which are more pronounced in the upper region of the cell. During solidification, the observed pattern suggests that the upper liquid solidifies more slowly than the bottom liquid due to residual buoyancy effects. However, some differences exist between the numerical and experimental results for both melting and solidification patterns. Experimentally, the melting front has an oval shape that grows upward, as shown in Fig. 4, while in the numerical counterpart, the melting front is more circular and expands both horizontally and vertically, as shown in Fig. 6. For the solidification process, the behavior is similar in both cases.
These discrepancies may be caused by limitations in the model: first, heating of the glass sheet could influence the melting process through conduction; second, the radiation source is not perfectly uniform, which could lead to non-uniform heating of the paraffin; third, three-dimensional effects are not considered in the model, which could affect flow patterns; wall effects in the cell are ignored; and finally, the numerical model does not account for air bubbles or paraffin decomposition at high temperatures, which could impact the melting and solidification processes. However, the implementation of a more sophisticated model in the same problem would not help due to the longer computation times and complexity of the real problem.
The temperature profiles along the mid-horizontal and mid-vertical axes of the cell were analyzed at various time intervals during solidification and melting (Fig. 9). For the melting process, the experimental profiles along 
-axis (Fig. 9-(a)) initially exhibit a Gaussian temperature distribution, which intensifies over time, a trend also observed in the numerical simulations. However, a notable discrepancy arises at higher temperatures: while the experimental curves maintain a smooth Gaussian shape, the numerical profiles display a slight central discontinuity. The model incorporates a melting temperature range of 56–60 °C, resulting in a gradual slope in the numerical profiles that represent the paraffin’s mushy region during the phase change.

The melting curves along 
-axis (Fig. 9-(b)) follow a comparable pattern. Initially, a Gaussian profile is observed, which gains amplitude over time. In the experimental profiles, a constant temperature is maintained, whereas the numerical curves reveal the presence of the mushy zone. Additionally, a peak with a higher temperature is observed in the numerical profiles, corresponding to the center of the heat source. This peak reflects the higher energy density and increased heating in the molten paraffin.
The solidification profiles are shown in Figs. 9-(c) and 9-(d). These profiles demonstrate closer agreement between the experimental and numerical studies, with both the temperature magnitude and shape being consistent. A flattened Gaussian profile is observed across all cases. During the solidification process, the temperature distribution becomes more homogeneous throughout the cell.
Numerical profiles exhibit higher peak temperatures compared to experimental profiles, particularly during the initial melting phase. This discrepancy may be attributed to the idealized assumptions made in the numerical model, such as uniform material properties and the omission of the maximum operating temperature for the material. Numerical profiles also resolve the transition zone more clearly, capturing discontinuities in temperature. In contrast, the experimental profiles show a more gradual transition from solid to liquid phase, with smoother heating due to the camera resolution.

Fig. 10(a) presents the temporal evolution of the liquid fraction during the melting stage, comparing the experimental results with the numerical data. The numerical simulation reproduces the main experimental trend: a short heating period followed by a rapid increase in liquid fraction and a progressive stabilization as melting approaches completion. The overall agreement in the final liquid fraction suggests that the latent heat content is correctly represented in the numerical model. Nonetheless, certain discrepancies are evident. The onset of melting occurs slightly earlier in the experiment, and the experimental curve exhibits a steeper initial slope. This difference indicates that convective heat transfer within the experimental cell, enhanced by the localized radiative heating from the lamp, accelerates the melting process. The numerical model, based on a two-dimensional Gaussian representation of the heat source, produces a smoother and more symmetric thermal field. The experimental data display small oscillations in the liquid fraction, associated with transient convective plumes and the dynamic evolution of the melt front. The numerical model describes the global melting dynamics, but it underestimates the initial melting rate and does not reproduce the transient fluctuations observed experimentally due to the model simplifications.

Fig. 10. Volume melted rate during (a) melting and (b) solidification for experimental and numerical data.

Fig. 10(b) illustrates the evolution of the liquid fraction during the solidification stage. Both the experimental and numerical results show a decreasing trend with time, confirming that the enthalpy formulation adequately reproduces the overall phase-change behavior. The experimental curve exhibits a more irregular pattern, with intermittent plateaus and abrupt drops, while the numerical prediction shows a smoother, monotonic decay. These irregularities are consistent with the presence of localized solidification fronts and the intermittent shutdown of natural convection as the melt fraction decreases. The completion time of solidification also differs slightly between both cases. The experiment reaches full solidification earlier than the numerical simulation, which suggests that the actual heat removal in the physical setup is stronger than the one modeled. Despite these deviations, the agreement in the total amount of solidified material supports the adequacy of the latent heat treatment in the numerical formulation.
The observed differences between melting and solidification arises from the distinct dominant heat-transfer mechanisms in each process. During melting, the localized radiative heating generates strong buoyant plumes that enhance mixing and accelerate the phase change, leading to a faster and less homogeneous evolution of the liquid fraction. Conversely, during solidification, convective motion weakens progressively as the liquid region shrinks, resulting in slower and more stable cooling fronts.
The discrepancies between experimental and numerical results can be attributed mainly to (i) the simplified representation of the heat source as a symmetric Gaussian function, which does not fully reproduce the spatial irradiance of the lamp, and (ii) the limited spatial and temporal resolution, which tends to smooth out transient convective features.
4. Concluding remarks
The phase change process of a PCM (paraffin wax) exposed to a localized radiation heat source has been studied experimentally. Natural convection was observed in a two-dimensional flow by placing the material in a Hele-Shaw cell configuration. Thermographic analysis was performed. Results were presented as images of the melting-solidification cycle. Numerical simulations were performed to predict the melting time, temperature, and velocity of convection during the process. The influence of heat transfer mechanisms on the phase change cycle was investigated.
The application of concentrated radiation to melt the PCM results in inhomogeneous melting. During experiments, we observed unmelted regions within the cell, a phenomenon attributable to slow conductive heat transfer in areas not directly exposed to radiative heating, as well as convective heat losses. In the initial melting phase, radiation heats paraffin regions exposed to higher light intensity, inducing localized melting. Once melting initiates, convection dominates, enhancing the melting rate and shaping the advancing melting front. As the molten region expands, the central paraffin region reaches elevated temperatures due to concentrated radiative heating. Near the melting interface, heat transfer occurs through a combination of convection and conduction, accompanied by the formation of a mushy zone at the fluid–solid boundary.
During solidification, heat transfer is governed primarily by convection and conduction. The process initiates in the lower region of the cell due to buoyancy-driven stratification, where hotter fluid remains in the upper region. Fluid recirculation around the molten region forms convection cells, though fluid velocity diminishes to negligible levels as the solidification cycle nears completion.
Unavoidable factors like material leakage, air bubbles during filling, image reflections, and other problems must be addressed to obtain more precise measurements. The melting process may be influenced by heating effects on the glass sheets, which could introduce discrepancies between experimental and modeled results.
The goal of this was to investigate how radiation influences the flow and how it might improve thermal energy storage in solar applications. We also examined how convection affects melting and solidification processes in Phase Change Materials (PCM). Simulations were performed using the enthalpy method in ANSYS Fluent, based on the finite volume method. Results were compared with thermographic images from experimental data. While discrepancies were observed in the spatial distribution of temperature and melting fronts, the overall qualitative behavior is similar. The numerical model has limitations, such as assuming a 2D flow, approximating the radiation source with a Gaussian distribution, and relying on an empirical mushy zone constant to model melting speed. Despite these limitations, the study represents an important first step in evaluating radiation effects and nonuniform heating on thermal energy storage.
Latent heat thermal energy storage systems are essential for effective energy management, and their advancement is highly dependent on phase-transition phenomena. Radiative heat transfer is very important in these systems because it offers significant benefits for solar energy harvesting, industrial recycling, and temperature control in buildings.
