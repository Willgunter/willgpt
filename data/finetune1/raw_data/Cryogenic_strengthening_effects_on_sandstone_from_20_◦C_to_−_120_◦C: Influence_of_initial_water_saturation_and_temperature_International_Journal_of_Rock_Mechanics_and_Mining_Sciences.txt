ABSTRACT
The underground storage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an emerging concept aimed at large-scale natural gas
storage. A comprehensive understanding of rock mechanics at ultra-low temperatures is essential for the safe and
efficient design of such storage facilities. This study conducted uniaxial compression tests on sandstones at
temperatures ranging from 20 ◦C to − 120 ◦C to assess the effects of temperature and initial water saturation prior
to freezing on their mechanical properties. Results indicate that sandstone strength increases progressively as
temperatures decline under varying water saturation conditions. At − 40 ◦C and − 80 ◦C, the sandstone initially
weakens at low water saturation levels but strengthens as saturation rises further. In contrast, at − 120 ◦C,
strength correlates positively with higher initial water saturation, with fully saturated samples exhibiting a 425
% strength enhancement compared to water-saturated sandstone tested at 20 ◦C. Micro-CT imaging indicates
minimal changes in pore structure at − 120 ◦C, suggesting negligible frozen damage to the sandstone. The significant strengthening observed at ultra-low temperatures can be attributed to three main factors: (1) the
enhanced mechanical properties of rock minerals at low temperatures, as confirmed by in-situ nanoindentation;
(2) increased ice strength with decreasing temperature, allowing ice to bear compressive loads; and (3) the
prestress provided by ice expansion to surrounding rock minerals, placing them in a multiaxial stress state that
significantly enhances strength. These results suggest that rock strength, particularly under water-saturated
conditions, improves substantially at ultra-low temperatures, which is advantageous for underground LNG
storage applications.
1. Introduction
Liquefied natural gas (LNG), being increasingly favoured compared
to non-clean energy such as coal and oil, is expected to play a more
important role in the future energy system.1 Thus, the demand for LNG
has rapidly increased in Europe, America and Asia.2,3 This trend is
particularly evident in China, where the net LNG import is projected to
grow significantly by 2050, approximately doubling from current levels
to 120–130 million tonnes.4 This increase in LNG import draws attention
to the problem of storage. Because ground tanks require a large area of
land for construction and disaster prevention,5 this storage method is
not the best, especially in urban or coastal regions where space is
limited. Thus, significant interest has been attracted in recent years to
the possibility of the storage of LNG in underground rock caverns.6,7
Underground rock caverns provide larger storage capacity with lower
construction and operational costs than traditional above-ground tanks,
which is crucial for meeting peak energy demands.
However, during underground LNG storage, due to the ultra-low
temperature of LNG reaching − 162 ◦C, the surrounding rock temperatures at the storage site can be reduced to a range between − 50 ◦C and
− 162 ◦C because of thermal conduction.6 Meanwhile, the rock surrounding the cavern needs to be drained during the first phase of construction to prevent unacceptable hydrostatic pore pressure and ice
formation behind the cavern lining.8 The formation of ice ring due to
cooling after LNG storage can be used as additional sealing barrier
against LNG leakage (Fig. 1). The water saturation of the rock surrounding the cavern gradually increases from the pre-drained zone towards the fully saturated zone before freezing. Therefore, predicting
how mechanical properties of frozen rocks with different initial water
saturations will behave under ultra-low temperatures is essential to
avoid leakage and ensure the long-term safety of storage sites.
Since the 1970s, researchers have conducted extensive studies on the

strength of different types of rocks at low temperatures. Rocks, including
sandstone, limestone, granite, basalt, marble, andesite and tuff, are
generally strengthened after freezing.5,9–14 The mechanical properties of
rocks, including uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, and
Young’s modulus, are reported to increase after freezing compared to
those at room temperature.
However, most previous research mainly focuses on mechanical
properties of frozen rocks at temperatures above − 50 ◦C,15–21 whereas
the research under ultra-low temperatures (referring to extremely low
temperatures below − 100 ◦C22) conditions has mainly focused on both
dry and saturated conditions.5,9,10,12,23 The strength variation of rocks
with different water saturation at ultra-low temperatures is not
well-defined. Fig. 2 summarizes up-to-date previous studies of strength
variation of rocks at ultra-low temperatures. Mellor10 indicated that the
strength of sandstone, limestone, and granite slightly increased as the
temperature decreased under dry conditions, whereas in saturated
conditions, all three types of rocks showed a significant increase in
strength as the temperature decreased. However, after − 120 ◦C, the
strength of all three rocks decreased. Inada and Yokota5 revealed that
rock strength with varying water saturation levels increased almost
linearly with decreasing temperature. Interestingly, rocks with higher
water content had lower strength compared to those with less water
content under the same conditions. Wang23 showed minimal strength
variation for sandstone and dry tuff, but a significant increase in the
strength of saturated tuff, highlighting the impact of water content on
the mechanical properties of rocks under low temperatures. Conversely,
Zhang et al.12 showed that when the temperature dropped from room
temperature to − 180 ◦C, the strength enhancement of both saturated
and dry sandstone was not significant. In summary, rock strength in
general increases at ultra-low temperatures, but the strengthening effects vary with rock types. Moreover, the influence of initial water
saturation on frozen rocks at ultra-low temperatures remains unclear.
It is well known that water has weakening effects on the mechanical
properties of rocks.24 However, the situation becomes complex when
rock freezes at different low temperatures and with different compositions in pores (ice, air, and unfrozen water inside). Three key questions
remain unsolved: 1) how the mechanical properties of rocks vary with
different initial water saturation from room temperature to ultra-low
temperatures, 2) what roles unfrozen water and ice play on rock
strength at different low temperatures, and 3) what are the microscopic
mechanisms of these influences.
In this study, we investigated the effects of both temperature (from
20 ◦C to − 120 ◦C) and initial water saturation (eleven saturation levels
from 0 % to 100 %) on the mechanical properties of frozen sandstones.
Moreover, the hardness variations of single rock minerals were
measured by in-situ nanoindentation at ultra-low temperatures. Thermal
strain observed under these conditions using microscopy was also analysed. Computed tomography (CT) was used to analyze the changes in
pore structure and damage situation of sandstones before and after the
ultra-low temperature treatment. The potential roles of unfrozen water
weakening effects as well as the ice strengthening and damage effects on
mechanical properties were discussed. The results are of great significance to the evaluation of the surrounding rock stability of underground
LNG storage and provide suggestions for their safety design.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sample preparation
The sandstone samples used in the test were sourced from Yaan City,
Sichuan Province of China, and exhibited a reddish-brown colour. To
minimize differences in the original parameters of different sandstone
samples, all samples were taken from the same intact rock block. The
average porosity and dry density of the samples are 7.64 % and 2.39 g/
cm3
, respectively, and the properties of the dry sandstone are shown in
Table 1. X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 3) reveals that the primary
mineral components are quartz and albite, with minor amounts of
calcite and other minerals. According to the recommendations of the
International Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, the
rock samples were prepared as standard cylindrical samples with dimensions of Φ50 × 100 mm. The diameter deviation along the sample
height does not exceed 0.3 mm, and the end-face distance deviation does
not exceed 0.05 mm.
In this study, samples with varying water saturation levels were
prepared under four different temperature conditions: 20 ◦C, − 40 ◦C,
− 80 ◦C, and − 120 ◦C. For each temperature, 11 groups of samples were
created with water saturation levels ranging from 0 % to 100 % with 10
% increment. Each group consisted of 5 samples with a total of 220
samples.
The samples were first dried by placing them in an oven at 105 ◦C for
12 h. After drying, samples were taken from the oven and weighed after
cooled to room temperature in a desiccator. After that, samples were
submerged in water within a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pressure of
100 kPa was applied for 12 h until no bubbles were observed on the
sample surface. The pressure was then released, and the samples were
saturated for another 12 h before their weight was recorded.
The porosity of the samples was calculated using the dry and saturated weights. The mass of each sample corresponding to its water
saturation level was determined. Fully saturated samples were prepared
using the vacuum saturation method, while samples with high water
saturation levels were partially dried in a well-ventilated area, weighed
every 30 min until the desired saturation was achieved. For samples with
lower water saturation levels, an oven at 80 ◦C was used, with weights

recorded every 30 min until the required mass was reached. The preparation of fully dry samples followed the same drying procedure. After
preparation, all samples were tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and
sealed, then left to equilibrate for 10 d at room temperature to ensure
uniform moisture distribution.
2.2. Ultra-low temperature treatment
The samples wrapped in cling film were placed in a cryogenic freezer
(Guangdong Aoxue DW-150W42) for low-temperature pre-treatment.
Before treating the samples, the temperature inside the freezer was
calibrated, as shown in Fig. 4a. A rock sample of Φ50 × 100 mm was
drilled at the center of its end face to a depth of 50 mm, where a T-type
thermocouple was embedded. The hole was filled with a mix of rock
powder and concrete, and after drying, another T-type thermocouple
was attached to the sample’s surface. The sample was then wrapped in
cling film.
During calibration, a thermocouple was also attached to the inner
wall of the freezer, which was then cooled to the corresponding testing
temperatures. The cooling curves for the freezer wall, sample surface,
and sample core are shown in Fig. 4b. Initially, the freezer wall cooled
faster than the rock, with a temperature difference of about 25 ◦C. The
temperature difference between the rock surface and core was less than
3 ◦C, narrowing as the target temperature was approached. Due to the
thermal insulation provided by the cling wrap and heat loss in the
freezer, the temperature difference between the sample core and the
freezer wall stabilized at around 8 ◦C. It took over 8 h for the samples to
cool to − 120 ◦C, thus they were placed in the freezer 12 h in advance
before uniaxial compression tests to ensure thorough cooling. The
temperature treatment paths of the samples in the tests at different
temperatures are shown in Fig. 4c.
2.3. In-situ uniaxial compression tests at ultra-low temperatures
The uniaxial compression strength tests were conducted using the
electro-hydraulic servo control testing system at Hebei University of
Technology, Tianjin (Fig. 5). The equipment is computer-controlled,
with a maximum load capacity of 600 kN, load control precision of
10− 6 kN, and displacement control precision of 10− 4 mm. A lowtemperature chamber, using liquid nitrogen cooling, was installed
around the equipment, allowing temperature control from room temperature down to − 180 ◦C. For room temperature tests, the lowtemperature chamber was not used. For low-temperature tests, the

chamber was first cooled to the target temperature. The rock samples,
taken from the cryogenic freezer and stripped of cling wrap, were placed
at the center of the loading platform. The chamber was then sealed, and
the loading axis was adjusted to contact the rock surface, maintaining
this setup for a period to minimize the impact of temperature loss during
sample transfer on the testing results.
One rock sample with a thermocouple inside was placed in the lowtemperature chamber. The loading program was initiated once both the
temperature of chamber and the calibration sample reached the target
temperature. In accordance with ISRM recommendations, all samples
were loaded at a constant rate of 0.2 mm/min. During the test, loaddisplacement data and failure modes of the samples were recorded.
2.4. Microscopic experiments
2.4.1. In-situ nanoindentation tests at ultra-low temperatures
The pure mineral samples of quartz, calcite, and feldspar were
sequentially ground into thin slices of 5 × 5 × 0.8 mm using 450 mesh,
800 mesh, and 1200 mesh sandpapers. The samples were then polished
to a mirror finish using alumina suspension (0.5 μm) and polishing cloth,
followed by ultrasonic cleaning. The tests were conducted on a nanoindenter (Bruker TI 980) equipped with a low-temperature environmental chamber and cooling/heating stage (Fig. 6). The temperature of
the cooling/heating stage is regulated through a combined system of
liquid nitrogen cooling and resistance heating elements, operating from
− 120 ◦C to 600 ◦C with a precision of ±0.001 ◦C. The testing temperature was the same as that used in the uniaxial tests, and six indentation
points were selected for each mineral under each temperature condition.
The sample holder was fixed on the stage, and the relative position of the
load head and microscope was calibrated before the room temperature
test, while also performing an air calibration to prevent interference

with the pressure sensor. The indenter was adjusted to ensure it was
level with the sample surface, and the smoothness of the sample surface
was checked to meet the testing requirements.
During the test, a maximum load of 10 mN was applied to quartz and
feldspar, and a maximum load of 6 mN was applied to calcite. The
loading scheme was as follows: load for 5 s, hold for 2 s, and unload for 5
s. Before the low-temperature tests, the environmental chamber was
sealed, and the cooling stage was filled with liquid nitrogen to lower the
temperature to the testing conditions. Simultaneously, low-temperature
nitrogen was introduced into the environmental chamber to cool the
load head, thereby preventing excessive temperature differentials between the sample and the loading apparatus. The indenter was adjusted
to make initial contact with the sample to ensure that the indenter and
sample reached thermal equilibrium, while maintaining a drift rate of
the indenter less than 2 nm/s. The indentation hardness can be derived
from the O&P method25 and the calculation method can be found
elsewhere.26
2.4.2. X-ray micro-CT imaging
The sandstone sample was polished into a cubic shape with dimensions of 5 × 5 × 10 mm. After ultrasonic cleaning and drying, it was
scanned using YXLON FF35 X-ray micro-CT. The scanning parameters
for the X-ray tube are shown in Table 2. The same sample was scanned
three times: dry sample before freezing, sample after freezing at dry
condition, and sample after freezing at water-saturated condition. The
freezing conditions involved wrapping the sample in plastic wrap and
placing it in a freezer at − 120 ◦C for 24 h. The sample was then removed,
allowed to return to room temperature, and dried. CT images and pore
structure changes in the same area of the sample before and after
freezing were compared.
2.4.3. In-situ DIC tests at ultra-low temperatures
In-situ digital image correlation (DIC) under an optical microscope
was used to analyze the thermal strain of sandstone samples at ultra-low
temperatures. The sandstone sample was polished into thin slices of 10
× 10 × 1 mm, then ultrasonically cleaned, dried, and saturated. One side
of the sample was coated with white primer and sprayed with fine black
speckles, then stored in an airtight environment for later use. An optical
microscope (Emspira 3, Leica, Germany) equipped with a cooling stage
(Instec, USA) was used to photograph the sample (Fig. 7). The sample
was placed in the center of the cold stage, sealed, and nitrogen gas was
introduced to prevent internal water vapor from forming frost. The cold
stage was cooled using liquid nitrogen, adjusted to the desired test
temperature (20 ◦C to − 160 ◦C), and held for 10 min to ensure uniform
temperature across the sample. During testing, nitrogen gas was
continuously blown onto the cold stage window to prevent frost from
affecting the results. A photograph was taken at room temperature
(20 ◦C) as the deformation starting point. At other temperatures, five
consecutive photos were taken at 30-s intervals. VIC-2D software was
used to analyze the captured images and calculate the thermal strain of
the sandstone at different temperatures.
3. UCS test results
3.1. Stress-strain curves of sandstones at different temperatures
The typical stress-strain curves of rock samples under uniaxial
compression can generally be divided into four stages: initial compaction stage, linear elastic stage, plastic yielding stage, and post-peak
failure stage. Some of the testing results are shown in Fig. 8. At room
temperature, the stress-strain curves of sandstone exhibit the characteristics of typical curves, with a distinct compaction stage and a relatively long linear deformation stage. This is because the sandstone
samples used in the test have a high porosity, making the compaction
stage more pronounced. Meanwhile, the yielding stage is shorter, and
the post-peak failure is abrupt. Most samples fail directly in the linear
elastic stage, indicating high brittleness of the sandstone with almost no
plastic deformation. Saturated sandstone is significantly affected by
water weakening, making the yielding stage more pronounced.
As the temperature decreases, the linear elastic stage of the rock
samples progressively lengthens, while the yielding stage gradually
shortens. At − 120 ◦C, there is almost no yielding stage, and failure occurs directly from the elastic stage. This is because, in water-containing
sandstone below 0 ◦C, the phase transition of water in the pores leads to
expansion, causing overall rock expansion and increased strain for pore
closure. At the same time, the rock’s brittleness increases, making brittle
failure more likely. As the temperature continues to drop, the contraction of the rock combined with the expansion due to the ice phase
transition fills the pores with ice, making the rock more compact overall.
The compaction stage shortens, and the overall brittleness of the rock
increases, resulting in a shorter yielding stage.
3.2. Mechanical properties of sandstones at different temperatures
The mean and standard deviation of UCS, Young’s modulus, and
peak strain of the sandstone samples calculated from the measured
stress-strain curves for each temperature and saturation condition are
shown in Table 3.
Fig. 9a shows that the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of
sandstone at room temperature decreases initially and then gradually
stabilizes as water saturation increases. When the water saturation increases from 0 to 50 %, the average UCS of sandstone decreases from
73.4 MPa to 48.4 MPa, a reduction of 34 %, and then stabilizes around
50 MPa. This decline is due to the weakening effect of water on the
sandstone, leading to a reduction in strength. The changes in Young’s
modulus and peak strain follow a trend similar to the change in UCS.
Under − 40 ◦C conditions, the UCS of sandstone exhibits an initial
slow decrease followed by an increase as water saturation rises. When
water saturation increases from 0 to 30 %, the strength of sandstone

decreases from 73.9 MPa to 63.3 MPa, a reduction of 13.9 %. Subsequently, the strength significantly increases until full saturation. The
average strength of saturated sandstone is about 58 % higher than in the
dry state. When water saturation is low, ranging from 0 to 50 %, the
elastic modulus follows a similar trend to the strength. Beyond 50 %
saturation, the elastic modulus stabilizes and does not increase along
with the sandstone strength. The peak strain’s trend generally aligns
with strength, increasing by 43.2 % under saturated conditions
compared to the dry state.
At − 80 ◦C, the strength of sandstone shows a three-stage variation
with increasing water saturation: a slight decrease, a substantial increase, and then stabilization. When water saturation increases to 10 %,
20 %, and 30 %, the strength decreases by 15 %, 13.3 %, and 7 %,
respectively. When water saturation reaches 70 %, the average strength
of sandstone reaches 176.3 MPa, an 80.4 % increase compared to the dry
state, and stabilizes around 174 ± 5 MPa. The elastic modulus at this
stage does not significantly change with water saturation, while peak
strain maintains a strong correlation with UCS at lower water saturations. However, when water saturation exceeds 60 %, peak strain continues to increase.
At − 120 ◦C, the strength, elastic modulus, and peak strain of sandstone all continuously increase with rising water saturation. The average
strength of saturated sandstone reaches 263.6 MPa, a 71.4 % increase
compared to the dry state, which is 3.6 times the strength of dry sandstone at room temperature and 5.2 times the strength of sandstone with
the same saturation level at room temperature. The elastic modulus
generally shows an increasing trend, correlating well with the strength,
while peak strain increases initially and then levels off.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of water-weakening on rock mechanical properties
Water in sandstone can react physico-chemically with the mineral
components, increasing pore pressure and decreasing grain friction,
which leads to a reduction in rock strength.27 Firstly, the presence of
water causes the strong Si-O bonds in silicate minerals like quartz to
transform into weaker hydrogen bonds.27,28 Carbonate minerals like
calcite29 can dissolve in water, and the swelling of clay minerals30 due to
water absorption can expand microcracks and generate new ones. Secondly, during uniaxial compression testing, water in poorly connected
pores cannot be expelled quickly, leading to increased pore pressure,
which promotes the expansion and formation of microcracks.31,32
Lastly, as water saturation increases, the surface of minerals attracts
water molecules, forming a thin water film with low frictional strength.
This reduces the friction coefficient at grain boundaries, facilitating the
initiation and sliding of shear cracks, further reducing rock strength.33
Extensive research indicates that the effect of water-weakening
significantly reduces the mechanical properties of rocks, including
UCS and Young’s modulus, which aligns with our test results.34,35 Many
researchers, such as Bell,36 have demonstrated that the strength reduction due to water presence is proportional to the rock’s porosity. However, this conclusion is quite broad, as different types of rocks are
affected by water weakening to varying extents.
Shakoor and Barefield37 collected nine sandstone samples from
different locations in Ohio and Pennsylvania, testing the UCS of each
sandstone at various water saturations. Regression analysis of the results
showed that sandstone strength decreases approximately linearly with
increasing water saturation. Cheng et al.38 measured the UCS of sandstone after different soaking times and fitted the strength change with
water content using a linear relationship. Chen et al.39 prepared sandstone samples with different water contents using two soaking methods,
finding that the strength reduction pattern varied with water distribution but was not linear in either case. In an earlier study,34 test results
indicated a two-stage reduction in sandstone strength with water content: a rapid decrease when water content increased from 0 to 1.5 %,
followed by a slower decline as water content continued to rise.
Fig. 10 illustrates the trend of strength variation with water content
for the samples tested in this study. We fitted the test results using both a
two-stage linear model and an exponential model, with R2 values of 0.51
and 0.7, respectively. This suggests that sandstone strength is more
significantly affected by water weakening at lower water contents, and
as water content increases, the strength gradually stabilizes, with the
weakening effect approaching a threshold.

4.2. Mechanisms of strengthening effect in frozen sandstone at ultra-low
temperatures
Fig. 11 shows that the strength of sandstone increases as the temperature decreases, with the magnitude of enhancement being greater at
higher water saturations. Water-saturated sandstone exhibits a significant strength increase under ultra-low temperature conditions. A
sharper increase is observed after − 80 ◦C and the strength of saturated
sandstone at − 120 ◦C is 5.3 times that of saturated samples at room
temperature. This phenomenon results from the combined effects of
multiple factors. In this section, we will discuss the changes in sandstone
strength under the dual influence of temperature and water saturation
and the underlying mechanisms.
4.2.1. Effects of mineral strengthening at ultra-low temperatures
Fig. 11 shows that as the temperature decreases from room temperature to − 120 ◦C, the strength of dry sandstone can double. Additional test results10,12 indicate that under ultra-low temperatures, the
strength of dry sandstone can increase by 20–80 %. This suggests that
the intrinsic strength of dry sandstone slightly increases as the temperature drops, and that changes in the mechanical properties of the mineral grains within it cannot be ignored. However, calcite, feldspar, and
other minerals are generally small and irregular particles, it is difficult to

directly measure their strength, Therefore, the strength of minerals is
often estimated indirectly by measuring the hardness in engineering
practice.40–42 To investigate this, nano-indentation tests were conducted
on the primary mineral components of the tested sandstone under
ultra-low temperature conditions, with the results also shown in Fig. 12.
When the temperature decreased from room temperature to − 120 ◦C,
the hardness of calcite, quartz, and feldspar increased by 56 %, 19 %,
and 10 %, respectively, and the elastic modulus increased by 8 %, 13 %,
and 1 %, respectively. This indicates that the strengthening of dry
sandstone under low temperatures partially stems from the reinforcement of its mineral grains.
4.2.2. Effects of ice strengthening at ultra-low temperatures
Existing measurements indicate that,10 compared to dry sandstone,
the strength enhancement of saturated sandstone under ultra-low temperature conditions is more pronounced. In this study, when the temperature decreased to − 120 ◦C, the strength of saturated sandstone
increased by 425 %, much higher than the 109 % increase in dry
sandstone. Additionally, in granite with relatively lower water saturation, the strength only increased by 30–50 % at − 160 ◦C.5 This suggests
that the phase transition of pore water to ice is one of the key factors for
the strength enhancement of water-saturated rocks.
The strength of ice itself increases exponentially as the temperature
decreases. Uniaxial compressive strength measurements of ice were
conducted at different temperatures and loading rates,43 with the results
shown in Fig. 13. At − 10 ◦C, the strength of ice was relatively low across
all loading rates. As the temperature decreased and the loading rate
increased, the strength of the ice increased quickly, reaching a peak
strength over 60 MPa. Furthermore, due to the high porosity and good
pore connectivity of the sandstone, ice can migrate within the pores to a
large extent during freezing, leading to a more uniform distribution.
This ice can fill the pores of the sandstone and serve as a framework,
reinforcing the sandstone at the structural level.
Ice can also act as a binder between mineral grains. Studies have
shown that when the temperature decreases from − 10 ◦C to − 50 ◦C, the
shear strength of the ice-rock interface with different interface roughness can increase by 20–50 %.44 As the temperature continues to
decrease, the pore ice can enhance the crack initiation strength and
crack propagation strength, as well as increase the friction between
mineral particles, thereby improving the rock’s failure strength.

4.2.3. Effects of expansion induced by water-ice phase transition
During the freezing process, water undergoes approximately 9 %
volume expansion. When the initial saturation in a confined space exceeds 91 %, the increase in volume due to the phase transition of water is
restricted, leading to a rise in ice pressure. When ice forms within a pore,
the expansion-resulted internal pressure can initiate cracks. Meanwhile,
ice-filled pore networks of a rock, which can offer additional loadcarrying capacity in addition to rock minerals themselves, increase
rock strength and stiffness. In other words, both strengthening and
damaging effects exist for rock induced by ice formation.
To determine the damaging effect on sandstone at ultralow temperatures (− 120 ◦C), a sandstone sample was CT scanned three times:
dry sample before freezing, sample after freezing at dry condition, and
sample after freezing at water-saturated condition (Fig. 14). No significant difference before and after freezing were found in the sandstone
either in dry or saturated conditions. The CT-resolved porosities before
freezing, after dry freezing, and after saturated freezing are 2.14 %, 2.14
%, and 2.12 %, respectively. Moreover, the pore structure and connectivity remain largely unchanged after freezing (Fig. 14). The slight
changes in pore connectivity are due to the closure of a few micropores
and the formation of new ones. Thus, the strain induced by freezing
expansion is primarily elastic, with a minor component of plastic strain.
While plastic strain may accumulate and cause damage during freezethaw cycles, it is negligible during a single cycle of freezing.
Therefore, in contrast to hydraulic fracturing, which promotes fracture expansion,45–47 thermal expansion of ice in frozen rock has obvious
strengthening effects on rocks. A possible explanation is that the local
compressive stress induced by the expansion of ice can provide prestress
to the surrounding rock minerals, so that most regions of rock minerals
are in a multiaxial stress state. This effect can be amplified with the
decreasing temperature and the increasing water content. Under
multiaxial stress conditions, the mechanical properties of rocks are
improved.
4.2.4. Effects of rock thermal deformation at ultra-low temperatures
The DIC test results (Figs. 15 and 16) suggest a pronounced thermal
deformation of the sandstone as the temperature decreases, and the
difference in deformation characteristics between saturated and dry
sandstone is obvious due to the expansion of the pore water phase
transition. For dry sandstone, the contraction strain increases approximately linearly with decreasing temperature, and the contraction is
relatively uniform and essentially isotropic in the x and y directions.
Frozen contraction of the dry sandstone creates contraction stress within
it, which increases the cohesion and intergranular friction of the sandstone and ultimately increases its strength.
Instead, the thermal deformation of saturated sandstones at low
temperatures exhibits a strong inhomogeneity. At the early stage of
freezing (− 5 ◦C), the saturated sandstone produces local inhomogeneous expansion caused by the water-ice phase transition. Then, the
expansion region continues to expand and reaches a maximum at
− 20 ◦C, followed by linear contraction, reaching a balance between
expansion and contraction around − 65 ◦C to − 85 ◦C. Subsequently, the
contraction region gradually enlarges, but some regions remain in the
expanded state up to − 160 ◦C. Contraction of water-bearing sandstones
after freezing intensifies the multiaxial stress state between minerals,
and the mechanical properties of sandstones are further improved.
Moreover, the CT scans in Fig. 14 show that the internal pore distribution of the sandstone is inhomogeneous. The porous regions are more
affected by the expansion of the water-ice phase transition and expand
more significantly, while the relatively dense regions begin to contract
shortly after freezing. The expanding and contracting regions are
wrapped around each other, and the resulting interregional forces make
the different regions more tightly embedded together, which also enhances the strength of the sandstone.
In addition to phase transitions and sandstone contraction, ultra-low
temperatures also induce changes in the crystalline structure of ice.
Although crystalline ice has many phases, typically only the hexagonal
phase (ice Ih) is stable under normal conditions.48 However, at temperatures below − 80 ◦C, a portion of ice Ih can transform into cubic ice
(ice Ic). The coexistence of ice Ih and ice Ic leads to the formation of
stacking disordered ice (ice Isd).49,50 Compared to hexagonal ice, cubic
or stacking disordered ice is denser and occupies less volume, facilitating further contraction of the sandstone without significant damage.
Therefore, the combination of the above factors results in a continuous
increase in the strength of the water-bearing sandstone with decreasing
temperature (Fig. 11c).

4.3. Influence of initial water saturation on frozen rock mechanical
properties
At temperatures of − 40 ◦C and − 80 ◦C, the strength of sandstone
initially decreases slightly with increasing initial water saturation, then
continuously increases as saturation continues to rise (Fig. 9). Factors
influencing this behaviour may include the weakening effect of unfrozen
water and the creation and expansion of nanopores during the freezing
process. At low water saturation conditions, water fills smaller pores and
corners (Fig. 17a). Additionally, the freezing point of pore water is
influenced by pore size and surface curvature; smaller pores have higher
surface tension, which lowers the freezing point of water,51 a
phenomenon known as the Gibbs-Thomson effect.52 Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) test results show that although the unfrozen water
content of porous media decreases to less than 10 % at − 5 ◦C,53–56 some
water remains liquid at temperatures well below 0 ◦C. At temperatures
as low as − 50 ◦C, about 3–7 % unfrozen water was also detected in
sandstones,57 and even in small amounts in porous media at − 80 ◦C.58
Furthermore, NMR testing results show that sandstone freezing also
promotes the expansion and generation of nanopores (pore size: 10 nm)
that exceed the CT resolution limit.59,60
In contrast, for rocks with higher initial water saturation, larger
pores are more likely to contain ice, and the strengthening effect of ice
prevails (Fig. 17b). At − 120 ◦C, the strength continues to increase with
higher initial water saturation, with no decline observed (Fig. 9d). This
is because, at such low temperatures, less unfrozen water remains, and
the ice-strengthening effect becomes dominant.
5. Conclusions
This study investigates the variation of frozen rock strength by
conducting uniaxial compression tests on sandstones from 20 ◦C to
− 120 ◦C and varying water saturation conditions. The effects of mineral
and ice strengthening, water-ice phase transition, rock thermal deformation, (unfrozen) water weakening effects, and changes in pore
structure on sandstone strength have been analysed in conjunction with
microscopic experiments such as nanoindentation, DIC, and CT scans.
The results provide a reference for the design and safety assessment of
underground LNG storage projects. Major conclusions are as follows:
• Increasing water saturation at room temperature nonlinearly degrades sandstone’s mechanical properties. UCS and Young’s
modulus decrease by up to 30 % and 10 %, respectively, before
stabilizing at higher saturation levels, reflecting the thresholddependent nature of water’s weakening effect.
• Changes in the strength of frozen rock depend on both temperature
and water saturation. As temperature decreases, the sandstone’s
strength at different water saturation levels gradually increases, with

higher saturation levels exhibiting more pronounced enhancement.
At − 40 ◦C and − 80 ◦C, sandstone experiences weakening at lower
water saturation due to unfrozen water and nanopore formation
during freezing. However, its strength resumes increasing as water
saturation continues to rise. At − 120 ◦C, the weakening effect is
counterbalanced by ice strengthening and mineral hardening,
resulting in a consistent strength increase with higher water
saturation.
• Microscopic experiments indicate that at least three mechanisms are
the main factors driving the strength enhancement of ultra-lowtemperature sandstones: 1) mineral hardening: in-situ nanoindentation confirms enhanced stiffness of rock minerals at low
temperatures; 2) ice load resistance: high-strength ice directly bears
external loads during initial compression; 3) prestress from ice
expansion: ice formation induces confined multiaxial stress states in
the mineral matrix, elevating macroscopic strength, and is further
reinforced by the freezing contraction of the sandstone
