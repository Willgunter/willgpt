Abstract
This paper establishes a numerical simulation model for ship-ice collision based on the cohesive element method, validated by in-situ data from the “Xuelong-2” Arctic expedition and statistical analysis. The collision phenomena and load statistical characteristics under different conditions are analyzed. Firstly, the material model parameters are determined through uniaxial compression and three-point bending simulations of sea ice, verifying the consistency of sea ice strength with the statistical characteristics of the actual sea area. Then, the fracture process of level ice under ship impact is simulated using the failure of cohesive elements, and the dynamic characteristics of the simulated ice load are shown to agree well with the actual ship inversion data through statistical analysis. Finally, the simulation results under multiple conditions are fitted and estimated based on the three-parameter Weibull distribution model, exploring the influence of ship speed and ice thickness on ice-breaking phenomena, as well as the variation patterns of scale and shape parameters. This paper fully utilizes the statistical characteristics of in-situ data and simulation results, providing a new approach for validating ship-ice collision simulation methods, which can effectively and accurately simulate the ice load during icebreaker navigation.

1. Introduction
As Arctic ice melts due to global warming, the growing commercial value of polar shipping has become a global strategic focus. Icebreakers, as critical vessels ensuring the safety of polar navigation, inevitably collide with sea ice multiple times during voyages in ice-covered regions. The resulting ice loads pose a threat to the structural safety of the ship's hull. Current research on ship-ice interactions can be primarily categorized into empirical formula methods, experimental methods, and numerical simulation methods.
As a mainstream numerical simulation method, the nonlinear finite element method (FEM) features a mature theoretical foundation and extensive support from commercial software, enabling the definition of sea ice constitutive models through its stress-strain relationship for simulation of mechanical behavior. Liu et al. (2011) employed the Tsai-Wu yield criterion with plastic flow theory to model iceberg failure and hull energy absorption, later extended by Gao et al. (2015) for parametric studies on impact conditions. Shi et al. (2017) incorporated temperature gradients to refine the yield surface and improve the modeling of elastic-plastic transition. Ehlers and Kujala (2014) used an isotropic elastoplastic model, calibrating material parameters with particle swarm optimization to match bending test results. Gagnon (2011) introduced a compressible foam model to distinguish pressure-dependent responses, capturing complex spalling for the first time.
In sea ice fracture simulations, traditional FEM often employs element deletion techniques to model crack initiation and propagation, treating ice as a continuous medium until elements satisfying a failure criterion are removed. Taylor and Jordaan (2014) combined this method with continuum damage mechanics to simulate compressive softening and fracture. Sazidy (2015) proposed a velocity-dependent bending failure model to capture the breaking of wedge-shaped plates. Jeon and Kim (2021) integrated the Drucker-Prager plasticity model to reproduce level ice bending and breakage processes consistent with experimental observations. Yi et al. (2021) used element deletion to study the effects of ship speed, ice thickness, and collision angle on ice loads and structural response.
Compared to traditional methods, the cohesive element method (CEM) represents sea ice fracture through cohesive element failure, accurately capturing crack initiation and propagation while mitigating the mass loss issues inherent in element deletion techniques. The CEM was first applied to ice mechanics by Mulmule and Dempsey (1997, 2000), who employed fictitious crack models validated through bending tests. This approach was subsequently extended to simulate local fragmentation patterns (Kuutti et al., 2013), replicate experimental stress-strain behavior under uniaxial loading (Gribanov et al., 2018), and model structural collisions conforming to ISO standards (Zhan et al., 2020). Field-scale validation was conducted by Gürtner et al. (2010) using full-scale simulations of lighthouse-ice interactions, further advanced by Patil et al. (2021) through parameter sensitivity studies and porosity-based scaling to estimate ice properties. To reduce mesh sensitivity, Lu et al. (2014) introduced stochastic fracture energy distributions, showing that element sizes 2–3 times the ice thickness improve load prediction. Wang et al. (2020) found optimal accuracy when mesh size matched the fracture length in cone-ice simulations. Feng et al. (2016) emphasized the dominant role of fracture energy and proposed mesh-dependent corrections for plastic strain energy. These developments, along with J-integral-based cohesive length correction (Huang and Ni, 2021), parameter calibration (Jiao and Zhang, 2022), and coupling of loading rate and in-plane forces (Li et al., 2024), have strengthened CEM’ s reliability in simulating realistic ice-structure interactions.
In the ice research based on in-situ data, the static and dynamic experiments carried out revealed the strength and brittleness characteristics of ice under different stress and strain rates (Youssef, 2003a, 2003b), providing a basis for the constitutive model parameters of numerical simulation. However, ice properties vary significantly with regional environmental conditions. For instance, Li et al. (2005) estimated compressive strength in the Bohai Sea using an empirical porosity-strength relationship, proposing region-specific design loads. Suominen et al. (2021) showed through three-point bending tests in Lake Saimaa that flexural strength of freshwater ice is nonlinearly dependent on temperature. Full-scale ship measurements further enhance engineering relevance. Takimoto and Wako (2007) measured ice loads on the patrol vessel Soya in the Sea of Okhotsk, correlating them with ice thickness and concentration. Erceg et al. (2015) emphasized the role of spatial distribution by comparing simplified models with direct measurements. Lee et al. (2017) demonstrated the influence of ice floe weight on hull loads using data from the Korean icebreaker Araon.
Given the stochastic nature of ice loads, many researchers have adopted a statistical approach, analyzing the short-term and long-term distribution characteristics of ship-ice interactions based on in-situ data. Suyuthi et al. (2012, 2014) analyzed local ice-load extremes from the vessel KV Svalbard, proposing a three-parameter exponential model that outperforms one-parameter exponential and Weibull fits for multimodal data. Kujala et al. (2019) applied a semi-empirical method (Kujala, 1996) to full-scale data from S.A. Agulhas II spanning 2012 to 2019, demonstrating superior long-return-period predictions compared to the Gumbel I distribution. Suominen et al. (2020) examined frequency, magnitude, duration, and rise time of ice loads during the ship's navigation, icebreaking, and turning, finding that maneuvers substantially increase stern-shoulder loads. Li et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2021b used Antarctic ship data to show that truncated and mixed exponential distributions better describe tail behavior of bow loads, and that long-term estimates are highly sensitive to parent distribution choice. They extended the Event Maximum Method (EMM) by incorporating ice concentration alongside thickness.
The CEM has been employed in ship-ice collision simulations to capture crack patterns and estimate load magnitudes during ice failure. However, limited research has focused on the statistical analysis of full-scale icebreaking simulations, with validation primarily based on empirical formulations. Moreover, assessments of ice material properties in these models often relies on ISO standards, which may not accurately reflect the sea ice characteristics in the actual navigation areas. To address these issues, this study determines the ice material parameters in a CEM-based model using in-situ measurements collected during the Arctic voyage of the “Xuelong-2” icebreaker. Ice load data derived from inverse analysis of ship navigation are statistically evaluated to examine their magnitudes and dynamic characteristics, thereby validating the proposed numerical approach. Additionally, the effects of varying ice thickness and ship speed on failure modes are investigated, and the statistical features of the resulting ice loads are analyzed. The findings provide insights for icebreaker design optimization and offer guidance for risk warning in practical ice navigation.
2. Numerical simulation method
2.1. Cohesive element method
The concept of the cohesive zone model (CZM) can be traced back to early studies on crack tip behavior by Dugdale (1960) and Barenblatt (1962), who proposed the cohesive zone model (see Fig. 1). Hillerborg et al. (1976) were the first to apply this model to material fracture research. Within the framework of the finite element method, they introduced the CZM using fracture mechanics approaches such as stress intensity factors and energy balance, enabling the simulation of crack initiation and propagation in quasi-brittle materials like concrete. This method of incorporating CZM into FEM is known as the cohesive element method (CEM).

Fig. 1. The cohesive region model proposed by Dugdale and Barenblatt.

The magnitude of the cohesive force is related to the crack opening displacement. Under external loading, the displacement separation between the two crack surfaces in the cohesive zone gradually increases, causing the cohesive force to rise accordingly. When the cohesive force reaches its maximum value, damage initiation begins in the material or structure, marking the onset of crack nucleation. Subsequently, the crack surfaces in the cohesive zone are gradually stretched and separated by the external load, leading to the accumulation of damage in the material or structure and resulting in the softening of the cohesive zone's stiffness. When the stiffness of this region reduces to zero, the cohesive force also drops to zero, and the material or structure is completely fractured. At this point, a crack tip forms and gradually propagates, creating a new cohesive zone. Typically, the relationship between the stresses 
 and displacements 
 on the crack surface is defined, allowing the calculation of the energy released during the formation of new crack surfaces, known as the fracture energy 
.
(1)
(2)
The constitutive relationship of the cohesive zone model is defined by the traction-separation law (TSL), with fracture energy release rate and fracture stress being two critical parameters. Fig. 2 illustrates the TSL curves for three different definitions of fracture: linear softening, trapezoidal softening, and exponential softening. The corresponding mathematical expressions for each curve type are also provided.

Unlike traditional finite element methods for constructing ice elements, the cohesive element method first discretizes the solid ice elements and then inserts thin cohesive elements along all internal boundaries of the solid ice elements. The strength of the cohesive elements is significantly weaker than that of the solid ice elements, ensuring that the cohesive elements fail and are deleted first during actual collision processes. This approach allows for the simultaneous consideration of both deformation and fracture of ice under structural loading. Compared to solid elements, the mass and volume of cohesive elements are negligible, meaning that the failure and deletion of cohesive elements have almost no impact on conservation laws. This effectively addresses the limitations of traditional finite element methods in modeling ice and offers advantages in simulating the processes of sea ice fracture, fragmentation, and accumulation.
2.2. Sea ice material model definition and validation
During ship-ice collisions, the primary focus is on the compressive and bending failure of sea ice. Therefore, this section will validate the feasibility of the defined sea ice material parameters by referencing in-situ uniaxial compression and three-point bending test data of Arctic ice (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4). To conservatively estimate ship-ice collision loads, statistical analysis of multiple sets of in-situ measured data was conducted, and the 90th percentile values of the test data were selected as the compressive and bending strengths of Arctic summer ice, which are 4.88 MPa and 0.27 MPa, respectively. The empirical cumulative distribution functions for these two parameters are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6.

The internationally recognized finite element software LS-DYNA was used to establish the sea ice model, and cohesive elements were inserted between the surfaces of the solid ice elements. Since the softening form of the TSL has minimal impact on the final numerical results when the fracture energy release rate is accurately defined (Cornec et al., 2003), this paper adopts the linear softening constitutive form as the failure mode for the cohesive elements. The solid ice elements utilize the MAT_024 model (PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY), which allows for flexible definition of the stress-strain relationship. Before reaching the yield stress, the material is in the linear elastic phase, satisfying Hooke's law. Subsequently, as the equivalent plastic strain increases, the material undergoes plastic softening, and the equivalent stress decreases until the crushing strain is reached. At this point, the corresponding crushing stress remains at a low value, indicating that the sea ice element can no longer bear external loads and may deform freely. The material parameters for the solid ice elements and the cohesive elements are listed in Table 1.

In the ice station experiments, the uniaxial compressive strength testing procedure specified by the ISO 19906 standard was followed. The ice samples were cylindrical, with a length of 110 mm and a diameter of 90 mm. A compression testing machine was used to apply axial symmetric compressive loads to the sea ice samples, and the loading force was recorded. The uniaxial compressive strength was calculated based on the maximum loading force during the sample's failure under compression. Since the uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice is rate-dependent, a crosshead speed of 0.1 mm/s was uniformly applied in all uniaxial compression tests to ensure comparability of the results. Accordingly, a numerical model for the uniaxial compression of Arctic ice was established based on the actual experimental records (see Fig. 7), and the pressure-displacement curves are shown.

The finite element model used to simulate sea ice bending failure consists of three main parts: the central sea ice beam, the upper loading indenter, and the two lower supports, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The main dimensions (length × width × height) of the sea ice beam are set to 500 × 50 × 65 (mm). The loading indenter at the top is positioned along the centerline of the ice beam, while the two supports at the bottom are located 200 mm from the centerline. During loading, the bottom supports are fixed, and the top loading indenter moves downward at a constant, slow rate.

In the three-point bending test of sea ice, the relationship between the bending strength of sea ice and the maximum load at failure is given by the following equation. Where 
 is the maximum load at which the ice sample fails, in N; 
 is the span between the loading supports, in mm; 
 is the thickness of the ice sample, in mm; and 
 is the width of the ice sample, in mm.

As shown in Fig. 10, the maximum load at which the sea ice specimen fails and fractures is 1030 N. Substituting this value into Eq. (7) yields a bending strength of 0.29 MPa for the sea ice model, with an error of 7 % compared to the measured bending strength. This validates the accuracy and feasibility of the selected sea ice model material parameters, demonstrating their ability to reflect the statistical characteristics of ice strength in actual navigation areas.

2.3. Collision model of ship hull and sea ice
In this section, a numerical model of the “Xuelong-2” ship hull and a level ice model will be established in LS-DYNA to simulate the ice fragmentation patterns and the magnitude of ice loads on the ship during collisions with level ice. Based on the navigation records from the “13th Chinese Arctic Scientific Expedition”, a continuous collision condition with level ice was determined. A stable 5-min period on August 15, 2023, was selected, during which the ice thickness was 1.2 m and the ship speed was 3 knots. Considering the impact of ice scale on collision results and computational efficiency, the width of the level ice was set to 80 m, focusing primarily on the ice loads encountered by the bow structure. To ensure consistency and validity in the statistical analysis of the numerical simulation results, the length of the level ice in the numerical model was set to 480 m, which meets the requirement for a 5-min simulation at a speed of 3 knots, aligning with the duration of the navigation records. Since crack propagation using pentahedral meshes can be more realistic compared to traditional eight-node hexahedral meshes, with more reasonable crack paths, the failure modes of the level ice and the energy required for crack formation are also more consistent with actual conditions. Therefore, the triangular face size of the pentahedral mesh for the ice body was set to 2.4 × 1.7 × 1.7 (m), twice the ice thickness of 1.2 m. The ship-ice collision model is shown in Fig. 11. The main dimensions of the icebreaker are listed in Table 2, and the hull model of the “Xuelong-2” was constructed based on these parameters. Since the primary focus is on the ice loads generated during collisions, the hull was simulated as a rigid body. Considering the arrangement of the sensors on the actual ship, the mesh size at the bow is set to 0.4 m, while the mesh is refined to 0.2 m in the primary region of interest for ice load inversion. The mesh size gradually transitions to 1 m towards the midship and stern sections, as shown in Fig. 12.

The contact between the ship hull and the level ice is defined as surface-to-surface eroding contact (CONTACT_ERODING_SURFACE_TO_SURFACE), while the contact between the level ice and the broken ice fragments is set as single-surface eroding contact (CONTACT_ERODING_SINGLE_SURFACE). The friction coefficient between the ship hull and the ice is set to 0.2, and the friction coefficient for the ice itself is set to 0.1. A velocity boundary condition is applied to the ship hull using the PRESCRIBED_MOTION_RIGID command to ensure that the icebreaker collides with the level ice at a constant speed. For the boundary conditions of the level ice, the side undergoing collision is set as a free boundary, while the other three sides are set as non-reflective boundary conditions (NON-REFLECTION BOUNDARY).
In addition to the interaction between sea ice and structures, the interaction between sea ice and seawater should also be considered to simulate the mechanical behavior of broken ice fragments detached from the level ice. However, fully computational fluid dynamics methods require significant computational resources, making the simulation efficiency of sea ice collisions with a large number of elements unacceptable. Therefore, this study develops a custom fluid dynamics solver through secondary development of the LS-DYNA software, which calculates the buoyancy and drag forces exerted by seawater on the sea ice elements. The buoyancy force on the ice elements in seawater can be calculated using the following equation:
(8)
Where 
 is the density of sea ice, taken as 1025 kg/m3; 
 is the gravitational acceleration, taken as 9.8 m/s2; 
 is the base area of the ice element, in m2; 
 is the height of the ice element, in m; and 
 is the z-coordinate of the ice element.
Considering that broken ice fragments in the simulation may submerge and move in water after multiple collisions with the ship and other ice fragments, the drag force on the ice elements can be calculated using the equation for viscous drag on objects in high-Reynolds-number viscous fluids:
(9)
Where 
 is the drag coefficient, taken as 1.05; 
 is the velocity of the ice element, in m/s.
The drag force is the force exerted on the ice element by ocean currents, and it depends on the relative velocity between the ice element and the current, as well as the projected area in the direction of motion. In the simulation, the seawater velocity is typically set to 0. Calculating the drag force on the ice element requires considering the effects of fluid flow in all three directions. Therefore, 
 is taken as the projected area in the direction of motion 
, allowing the addition of seawater drag forces in all three directions to the ice element.
3. Statistical analysis method and ice load data
3.1. Statistical analysis method of ice load
The process of ice load generation is often described using a triangular loading history, and the peak values are typically used to study the statistical patterns of ice loads. When extracting ice load peaks, the trigger value exceedance method and Rayleigh separation are used to identify qualified peak values from the time-history ice load curve, which are considered as the impact loads between the ship and the ice. During continuous collisions, the time history of ice loads can be regarded as a combination of multiple individual load peak events. The Rayleigh separation method compares two adjacent local maximum loads with the minimum load between them. If the local minimum is lower than the smaller maximum multiplied by a separation value, the ice load peak event is divided into two separate peak events at the position of the local minimum.
In collisions between icebreakers and level ice, the peak probability density statistics of ice loads typically follow a Weibull distribution. The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the three-parameter Weibull distribution are given by Eqs. (10), (11), respectively:
(10)
(11)
In the distribution model, 
 is the scale parameter, 
 is the shape parameter, and 
 is the location parameter, typically set as the statistical analysis threshold. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method is commonly used to solve for the scale and shape parameters of the distribution function. The core idea of this method is to estimate the appropriate parameter values by maximizing the likelihood function of the observed data. Given a set of independent and identically distributed observed data 
, 
, …, 
 the likelihood function is constructed as:
(12)
To simplify the calculation, taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields:
(13)
Next, by taking partial derivatives with respect to the scale parameter and the shape parameter, and iteratively solving using numerical methods until the parameter changes fall below a predefined threshold, the current parameter estimates can be considered convergent. The estimation equations for the parameters are as follows:
(14)
(15)
3.2. Analysis of in-situ ice load data
Based on the sensor arrangement in the ice load inversion area of the “Xuelong-2”, a matrix of fiber optic strain measurement points was installed on the starboard side of the hull, as shown in Fig. 13. The distance between two frames is 0.8 m, and there is a column of sensors at each half frame distance. The strain measurement points are arranged from frame No. 117.5 to 122.5, welded to the web of each frame, and can measure the strain perpendicular to the outer plate at a distance of 200 mm from the inner wall of the outer plate. This setup is used to invert the magnitude of ice loads acting on this area, providing in-situ measured data. The arrangement of the measurement points is illustrated in Fig. 14, and the actual navigation during continuous icebreaking on August 15, 2023, is shown in Fig. 15.

To ensure the results are accurate and reliable, the sum of the inversion values from all measurement points in each vertical column of the sensor matrix is used as the calculation unit, representing the resultant ice load within a 0.4 m span along the ship's length. For this analysis, the vertical columns of sensors at frame positions 117.5, 118, and 121.5 were selected as the comparison range. These correspond to the areas monitored by sensors 1 to 8, 9 to 16, and 65 to 72, respectively.
To perform statistical analysis on ice load peaks, it is necessary to first set a threshold for peak extraction to collect more valid peak data. To eliminate the effects of temperature-induced pressure gradients and hardware damage on the data, the average external load pressure inverted during the ice station test on August 14, 2023, was used as the basis for setting the extraction threshold, using the influence coefficient matrix method. Assuming that the strain response of the local structure of the hull is solely due to the deformation caused by the static effects of ice loads, while neglecting the local high-frequency strains induced by dynamic effects, the conversion relationship between strain and ice loads can be expressed as:
(16)
Or:
(17)
where 
 is the strain stiffness matrix of the conversion between strain and load, that is, the influence coefficient matrix; 
 is the strain flexibility matrix, that is, the inverse matrix of the influence coefficient matrix; 
 and 
 are the strain response vector and ice load vector at time 
 respectively, and the subscript 
 represents the number of measured strains.
The Eq. (17) can be rewritten as:
(18)
Each column of 
 (or 
) can be determined by applying a unit load at only one position of 
 each time, which is equal to the strain response vector at this time. Therefore, after obtaining the influence coefficient matrix, the local ice load in this area can be calculated by substituting Eq. (16) together with the monitored structural strain 
.
Fig. 16, Fig. 17, Fig. 18 show the total inverted loads for the sensor areas at frame positions Fr117.5, Fr118, and Fr121.5 during a half-hour period of the “Xuelong-2” ice station operation. These figures reveal that even when the ship is stationary at the ice station, there is significant load noise in these areas. To reduce errors in subsequent ice load processing, this noise is considered to have an average value of approximately 80 kN. Currently, there is no unified standard for threshold selection, but it is generally chosen to minimize the influence of adjacent structures and separate hydrodynamic loads. Therefore, this study sets the threshold for the measured load data slightly above the noise mean, at 100 kN.

After setting the load threshold, peak extraction was performed on the actual inverted ice loads at the three frame positions. Fig. 19, Fig. 20, Fig. 21 show the time-history curves of ice loads and the extracted load peaks for each frame position. It can be observed that the ice loads generally fluctuate at a relatively stable level, with several prominent peaks indicating moments of significant ice collision loads in these areas. The red dashed line represents the set threshold of 100 kN, and only values exceeding this threshold are considered as ice impact loads. The green circles indicate the magnitude of each peak during individual ice load events. Since the ice material model strength is set to 90 % of the in-situ strength data, the extracted ice load peaks were statistically analyzed, and the 90th percentile load values were calculated, as shown by the green dashed lines. After subtracting the threshold, these values are 213.85 kN, 193.31 kN, and 131.27 kN, respectively, and can serve as the basis for subsequent comparison between simulation and measured data.

4. Results and verification of numerical calculation of ice load
The simulation results of the ship-ice collision condition are as follows. During the continuous icebreaking process, the edge of the level ice is first subjected to pressure from the icebreaker's bow, leading to failure. Specifically, this is manifested by the deletion of cohesive elements and the detachment of adjacent ice elements from the level ice. These detached ice elements undergo deformation, flipping, sliding, and floating until they reaccumulate at the waterline height in the ship's wake (see Fig. 22, Fig. 24). As shown in Fig. 23, the failure path of the cohesive elements reveals that during the numerical simulation of the icebreaking process, the progressive failure of the level ice is accompanied by the generation of radial and circumferential cracks, with detached ice fragments of varying sizes. The above simulation example aligns well with the actual icebreaking process depicted in Fig. 15, demonstrating to some extent the applicability of the numerical simulation method used in this study for ship-ice collision simulations.

To further assess whether the numerical method meets the accuracy requirements for load analysis, the load history of each node in the selected region of the simulation results was extracted. Since the load statistics from each column of sensors in the measured data cover half the span distance forward and aft along the ship's length, the node regions to be analyzed in the numerical model for the three frame positions are outlined in red boxes in Fig. 25. The pressure time-history curves of all nodes within these regions were extracted and summed to obtain the total load, which represents the ice load time history under this condition in the numerical simulation. With a simulation trigger threshold of 20 kN (free from noise errors), the ice load time histories and peak extractions for the three frame positions are shown in Fig. 26, Fig. 27, Fig. 28.

In the statistical plots, the blue line represents the total ice load time history within the region; the red dashed line indicates the 20 kN threshold, used to filter out excessively small peaks; the green circles denote the load peaks extracted using the trigger value exceedance method and Rayleigh separation; and the green dashed line represents the average value of the extracted peaks. It also can be observed that the load curves exhibit random fluctuations, with several prominent peaks indicating moments of collision contact between the region and the ice model. In the simulation of the icebreaker continuously breaking 1.2 m thick ice at a speed of 3 knots, the average peak ice loads at the three selected frame positions, after subtracting the 20 kN threshold, are 165.64 kN, 191.23 kN, and 123.42 kN, respectively. These values are close to the 90th percentile peak load values measured at the corresponding positions, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 29, which summarize the relative errors.

Fig. 29. Comparison of in-situ data with simulation results.

From the above charts, it can be seen that the simulation results in this study are consistent with the in-situ data-inverted ice loads in terms of overall magnitude, and the time-history curves exhibit similar fluctuation patterns. The minor discrepancies in statistical values may arise from the fact that actual navigation conditions, such as ice conditions and ship speed, cannot remain entirely constant and may vary during the icebreaking process. Additionally, differences between the simulated draft height and the actual draft height during navigation could lead to variations in ice impact positions and angles, contributing to relative errors in the statistical values of ice loads. However, by comprehensively analyzing the similar patterns of level ice fracture and broken ice movement observed in the simulation compared to real-world scenarios, along with the statistical error results, the reliability and applicability of the ship-ice collision simulation presented in this study can be further validated.
5. Effect of thickness and speed on ice loading process and statistics
5.1. Analysis of failure phenomena of level ice
During the continuous straight-line icebreaking process of an icebreaker, changes in ice conditions and navigation operations can significantly influence the failure modes of level ice, thereby affecting the magnitude of ice loads on the hull. The numerical simulation method for ship-ice collisions presented in this study accurately reflects the failure modes and crack propagation paths of level ice, and the calculated ice loads on the hull align well with actual navigation data. Therefore, based on the aforementioned calculations, this section explores the failure phenomena of level ice under different icebreaking conditions by varying ship speed and ice thickness.
When setting up multiple simulation conditions, for cases with the same ship speed, only the ice thickness needs to be adjusted while maintaining the requirement for a 5-min calculation. For cases with the same ice thickness but different speeds, to ensure effective analysis of results without excessive computational resource consumption, the ship's travel distance for all continuous collision conditions is uniformly set to 460 m, ensuring that the hull collides with the same range of ice. Using the ship-ice collision numerical simulation method described in this study, simulations of the icebreaking process were conducted for each condition, and the failure behavior of cohesive elements is illustrated in the following figures.
Fig. 30 (1) to (9) illustrate the failure of cohesive elements during the icebreaking process under different ship speeds and ice thicknesses. Comparing the failure phenomena under the same ice thickness but different speeds, it can be observed that as the ship speed increases, the range of cohesive element failure narrows, and larger ice fragments detach from the level ice rather than just small pieces. This is because, at lower speeds, the ship primarily exerts compressive forces on the level ice, causing continuous pressure on the cohesive elements between ice elements, leading to the failure of cohesive elements far from the ship. At higher speeds, the dominant failure mode shifts to bending, where the level ice near the bow undergoes bending deformation under vertical pressure, resulting in larger ice fragments and less force propagation to distant areas. For the same ship speed but different ice thicknesses, it is evident that as the ice thickness increases, the range of cohesive element failure expands. This is also due to a shift in the primary failure mode of the level ice. Compared to thinner ice, the failure of thicker ice is primarily dominated by compression, allowing compressive forces to propagate further between ice elements and causing cohesive elements far from the ship to fail. However, since the range of ice thickness variation is small, the differences between the figures are minimal.

5.2. Ice load variations and statistical characteristics
This section investigates the influence of different conditions on the statistical characteristics of ice loads. Based on the comparative analysis of in-situ data and simulation results in Section 4, the sensors at frame position Fr118 exhibit better monitoring conditions, and the relative error in ice load calculations is smaller. Therefore, the simulation results for this region are used as the basis for analysis. The three-parameter Weibull distribution model described in Section 3.1 is employed to statistically analyze the ice loads during the simulation process of continuous collision level ice. The CDF curves were fitted based on the peak load points extracted under different conditions, as shown by the red curves in Fig. 31, and the goodness of fit value 
 was given in the upper left corner. All scale and shape parameters are recorded and summarized in Table 4. Taking condition 3 (3 knots speed breaking 1.2 m thick ice) as an example, the load peak points and the CDF curve are shown in Fig. 31-(3). The figure clearly demonstrates that the peak load points calculated by the ship-ice numerical simulation method in this study align well with the fitted curve. Additionally, the goodness-of-fit test yields an 
 value of 0.99, indicating that the ice load distribution characteristics calculated in this study can be accurately described by the three-parameter Weibull distribution model. For this condition, the scale and shape parameters are 213.40 and 1.56, respectively.

By distinguishing between different ship speeds and ice thicknesses, the trends in ice load means and the two distribution parameters (scale and shape) with respect to individual design variables are observed. Fig. 32, Fig. 33 show that as ice thickness and ship speed increase, the mean ice load continuously rises, indicating that the icebreaker experiences increasingly larger loads during icebreaking. The scale parameter also exhibits an upward trend with the increase of these two variables, suggesting that the distribution of ice load peaks becomes more dispersed, with more peak loads of larger magnitudes appearing. However, the shape parameter curve shows a downward trend at the end, meaning that as ice thickness and ship speed increase, the shape parameter initially rises slowly and then slightly decreases. This is because, at low speeds in thin ice, ice loads are mostly concentrated within a small range of values, causing the CDF to rise rapidly initially and then slow down. As ice thickness and speed gradually increase, ice loads become more distributed in the mid-range, resulting in a steeper rise in the CDF curve during the middle phase and flatter ends. Finally, as ice thickness and speed continue to increase, ice loads shift toward higher values, causing the CDF curve to rise more sharply in the later phase, while the middle phase becomes relatively flatter, leading to a slight decrease in the shape parameter.

This indicates that relying solely on the mean load is insufficient to assess the ice load level under current conditions. The increase in the scale parameter due to changing conditions results in a more dispersed distribution, which can lead to more extreme ice loads. The change in the shape parameter also suggests that the tail risk of the distribution may rise again. Therefore, for icebreaker design, sufficient margins must be incorporated to ensure structural safety and power feasibility. For icebreaker navigation, safe navigation thresholds must be established, and different navigation strategies should be adopted depending on ice thickness to ensure economic efficiency while reducing the probability of extreme loads.
6. Conclusion
This study employs the cohesive element method to conduct numerical simulations of ship-ice collisions, using the failure of cohesive elements to simulate the fracture and fragmentation behavior of level ice during the continuous icebreaking process. By applying statistical analysis methods and incorporating in-situ data from the “Xuelong-2” Arctic expedition, the ice material parameters and the applicability and accuracy of the hull load results were defined and validated. Finally, the ship-ice collision method developed in this study was used to simulate icebreaking conditions under different ice conditions and navigation operations, exploring the effects of ice thickness and ship speed on the failure modes of level ice and the resulting ice loads on the hull. The research results not only provide a basis for optimizing icebreaker design but also hold significant importance for risk warning in actual polar navigation. The main contributions and findings of this study are summarized as follows:
1)
For the first time, multiple sets of in-situ measured strength data of Arctic ice were used, with the 90th percentile values taken as the compressive and bending strengths of Arctic summer sea ice. A sea ice model was established based on the cohesive element method, and the uniaxial compression and three-point bending simulations were set up to align with actual experimental conditions. The calculation results validated the accuracy and feasibility of the selected sea ice material parameters, demonstrating their ability to reflect the statistical characteristics of ice strength in actual navigation areas.
2)
A dynamic ice load validation method was proposed based on in-situ monitoring data, demonstrating the reliability and applicability of the cohesive element method for ship-ice interaction simulations. By analyzing actual Arctic navigation records, a stable continuous icebreaking scenario was selected, with peak extraction thresholds determined from load time histories during ice station operations. Comparative analysis between simulation results and measurements demonstrates that the proposed numerical model accurately captures both the failure modes of level ice and the statistical characteristics of ice loads, showing excellent agreement with the measurement data obtained from “Xuelong-2”.
3)
Using the ship-ice simulation method proposed in this study, the effects of ice thickness and ship speed on the failure modes of level ice and the statistical characteristics of ice loads were investigated. An increase in ship speed shifts the failure mode of level ice from compressive failure to bending failure, while an increase in ice thickness gradually restores compressive failure as the dominant mode. As ship speed and ice thickness increase, both the mean ice load and the scale parameter rise, but the shape parameter slightly decreases at higher values. This phenomenon of increased tail distribution risk highlights the need to establish safe navigation thresholds for ice operations, ensuring both economic efficiency and a reduced probability of extreme loads.
However, this study still has some limitations. First, the influence of parameters such as temperature or porosity on ice material properties could be further considered to improve the accuracy of the ice material model. Second, the range of conditions could be expanded to further analyze the trends of statistical parameters of ice loads with respect to ice thickness and ship speed. Third, additional in-situ data under different ice conditions, such as float ice and ice ridges, could be processed and analyzed to investigate their impact on ice loads. These unresolved issues will be addressed in future research and supplementary studies.
