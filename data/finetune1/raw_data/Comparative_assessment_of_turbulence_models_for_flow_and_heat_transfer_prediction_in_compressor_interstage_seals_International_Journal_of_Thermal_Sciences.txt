1. Introduction
The development of adaptive cycle engines, particularly double-bypass variable cycle engines, represents a pivotal advancement in the pursuit of superior propulsion efficiency across a wide flight envelope [1]. A critical challenge in these engines is the significantly elevated airflow temperature entering the compressor system, resulting from high turbine outlet temperatures and complex bypass flow interactions [2]. This harsh thermal environment necessitates a paradigm shift in component design, where accurate prediction of heat transfer is no longer secondary but paramount for ensuring structural integrity and performance. As indispensable components, compressor interstage labyrinth seals serve the critical function of minimizing leakage flows between rotating and stationary parts [3], as shown in Fig. 1. The performance of compressor interstage labyrinth seals under the elevated temperatures of 1100–1300 K is crucial [4], as they must not only control leakage but also manage the intense thermal loads to prevent premature failure.

The flow field within a labyrinth seal is inherently complex, characterized by high-speed jet formation [5], flow separation [6], large-scale cavity recirculation [7], and intense turbulence [8]. These phenomena become even more challenging to predict in rotating compressor applications, where the interplay between pressure-driven flow, centrifugal forces, and centrifugal buoyancy effects [9] creates a highly three-dimensional and unsteady environment [10]. Hence, the accurate prediction of the flow structure and the associated heat transfer is a critical requirement for reliable design. It underpins the accurate estimation of leakage losses [11], rotor-dynamic coefficients [12], and thermal loads [13] that affect the mechanical integrity and lifespan of adjacent components [14].
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become a cornerstone of seal design and analysis. However, the accuracy of CFD simulations is profoundly influenced by the choice of turbulence model. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, particularly the widely used k-ε and k-ω families, offer efficient computational efficiency that makes them attractive for industrial design cycles [15]. Their fundamental limitation, however, lies in the reliance on the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity hypothesis, which models all turbulent scales [16]. This approach often fails to capture key physics in separated and unsteady flows, such as the large-scale vortex shedding and the anisotropic turbulence prevalent in seal cavities [17]. Consequently, while RANS models may provide reasonable predictions for bulk leakage rates, they frequently exhibit significant discrepancies in predicting local flow features, pressure distributions, and, most notably, wall heat transfer coefficients [10].
The limitations of RANS have spurred interest in more advanced scale-resolving simulation (SRS) methods, such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and hybrid RANS-LES approaches like Detached Eddy Simulation (DES). LES resolves the large, energy-containing turbulent scales directly and only models the smaller, more universal scales, offering superior accuracy for unsteady flows involving separation and vortex dynamics [18]. DES seeks to combine the strengths of RANS and LES by employing RANS in attached boundary layers and LES in separated regions, providing a balance between accuracy and computational cost [19]. Previous studies have demonstrated the capability of LES and DES to improve predictions in related flows, such as turbulent jets [20,21], cavity flow [22,23], and rotating passages [24,25]. For labyrinth leakage flow, Tyacke et al. [[26], [27], [28]] successfully applied LES to a labyrinth seal, revealing complex vortex dynamics that RANS could not capture. Similarly, Jefferson-Loveday et al. [29,30] used DES to study a stepped labyrinth seal, demonstrating improved agreement with experimental data.
Despite these advances, a systematic and comprehensive assessment specifically addressing the performance of RANS, DES, and LES in predicting both the flow field and heat transfer within a labyrinth seal under compressor-relevant conditions remains lacking. Existing studies often focus on either flow or heat transfer aspects independently. A direct comparison of all three models under identical conditions, clarifying their influence on the prediction of thermodynamic irreversibility, is notably absent. To address this gap, the present study conducts a comparative analysis of the RANS based on the k-ω model, DES, and LES for a rotating square-cavity labyrinth seal under the large temperature difference of 1000 K. The primary objectives are.
a)
To assess the ability of each model to capture the interaction between centrifugal force and centrifugal buoyancy, the unsteady vortex structures, and the evolution within the seal cavities.
b)
To evaluate the accuracy in predicting the wall heat transfer distribution and the correlation with flow dynamics.
c)
To analyze the thermodynamic irreversibility caused by viscous dissipation and heat transfer, providing insights into loss mechanisms from a second-law perspective.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the large-scale and multifunctional sealing test rig and test object. Section 3 describes the numerical methodology, including the geometrical model, mesh, boundary conditions, and solver settings. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, divided into comparative analyses of the flow field, heat transfer, and thermodynamic irreversibility. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and provides recommendations for enhancing turbulence models.
2. Experimental setup
The large-scale and multifunctional sealing test rig [31] was employed to verify the accuracy of the numerical methods. Fig. 2 shows the layout of large-scale and multifunctional sealing test rig. The test rig featured two separate flow circuits for air and oil. The sealing air was supplied by an air blower with a maximum flow rate of 4.5 kg/s and a maximum pressure of 1200 kPa. Power was provided by a 100 kW high-speed motor, reaching speeds up to 18,200 rpm. Motor cooling was facilitated by an MCW-25 cooler. An integrated oil supply system was established, including an oil tank, heater, oil pump, return pump, oil filter, flow meter, pressure transmitter, and temperature transmitter, to supply oil to the bearings under varying flow rates, pressures, and temperatures.

The pressure ratio, defined as the inlet total pressure to outlet static pressure across the labyrinth seal, was varied from 1.1 to 1.9 to control the flow rate. The effects of rotation were also considered by varying the rotational speed from 0 to 10,000 rpm. A thermal mass flowmeter was installed in the inlet pipe to directly measure the gas mass flow. Inlet total pressure and inlet total temperature were recorded by the probes located upstream of test section. Outlet static pressure was measured by the probes located downstream. In detail, the test section and object are shown in Fig. 3. The geometry of test object is consistent with numerical model. The gas temperature is set as 300 K. Thermal boundary conditions were controlled by a thermal jacket surrounding the stator housing, maintaining the wall temperature at 300 ± 1 K, verified by three circumferential K-type thermocouples. The rotor temperature was stabilized at 300 ± 1 K through the oil cooling circuit. The precision of pressure meter and temperature sensors is ±0.2 % and ±0.4 %, respectively. The resulting uncertainty in the discharge coefficient is ±0.96 %, while the uncertainty in static temperature rise is ±0.57 %. Additionally, a Hall sensor fixed at the end of the high-speed motor was used to measure the rotational speed.

3. Numerical model
3.1. Model and problem description
The heat transfer mechanism of interstage labyrinth seal in the compressor is different from that of the turbine, but there are few studies on it. There is not only windage heating but also dissipated heat, which makes numerical simulation a huge challenge. Fig. 4 shows the condition of compressor interstage labyrinth seal. To approach the real conditions in the high-pressure compressor of a variable cycle engine, the total inlet temperature is set to 1300 K. The wall is set to 300 K to reveal the vortex change and heat transfer under a large temperature difference. The model used in this study is a square-cavity straight-through labyrinth seal. To save computing resources, a section of labyrinth ring is selected as the computational model. Fig. 5 shows the simplified model and parameters. To save computing resources, a computational domain of 5° is used [10]. The square-cavity straight-through labyrinth seal has three straight fins, in which the fin height (h), fin width (w), fin pitch (p), and seal gap (CL) are 1.1 mm, 0.5 mm, 3.2 mm, and 0.13 mm, respectively. The radius (r) of the labyrinth ring is 60 mm.

3.3. Numerical method and validation
To avoid the difference caused by different grids, all turbulence models are calculated using a set of grids. This study emphasizes the differences in flow and heat transfer rather than comparing computational costs. The grids are block-structured grids consisted of 10.16 million, which are created in Ansys ICEM software. For all turbulence models, the y+ is lower than 1 in the region of labyrinth seal. Fig. 6 shows the computational model and grid size. In addition, the inlet and outlet of labyrinth seal are extended to avoid the influence of backflow on the convergence accuracy. P1 is the monitoring point located at the third gap outlet. Since the development of the flow through the first two gaps becomes more complicated, the monitoring points are selected here to determine whether to calculate the fully resolved flow. The flow is three-dimensional, so RANS, DES, and LES are used to investigate the flow and heat transfer in detail.

RANS simulations are performed using a steady pressure-based solver of Ansys CFX. The boundary conditions for RANS simulations were derived from the conditions in the interstage labyrinth seal of high compressors. Total pressure and temperature are used as an inlet boundary condition, and static pressure is correspondingly set as an outlet boundary condition. The lower wall is used to set the rotational speed. The RANS simulations are performed for a wide range of Ta/Re (between 0.141 and 2.600). Table 1 shows boundary conditions. The k-ω turbulence model was selected based on its demonstrated performance for wall-bounded flows and rotating machinery applications, as established in our previous study [9]. The medium is air (ideal air) with Sutherland's law used for variable viscosity. The formula of Sutherland's law is as follows:

Table 2 shows the fluid properties. Due to the dominant effects of pressure difference and rotation, gravity effects were neglected in all simulations. For the RANS simulations, a turbulence intensity of 5 % is applied. For DES and LES, no synthetic turbulence forcing is applied at the inlet, thereby avoiding the introduction of artificial inflow structures that could compromise the resolved turbulent dynamics.

DES model is a hybrid turbulence simulation method that combines the advantages of RANS and LES. It is often used to predict complex flows with separation, backflow, and large-scale vortex structures. LES is also used to capture all large-scale vortex structures. The simulation is initialized with steady RANS results. DES and LES simulations are performed with time step 3 × 10−8 s, running 12,000 time steps (14 fluid passes through the seal) to make the flow field reach a stable state, and then continue to run 18,000 time steps to collect statistical values (21 fluid passes through the seal). The average Courant number for the LES domain is smaller than 1. The residuals of continuity, momentum, and energy equations are monitored for convergence until 10−5.
To distinguish the prediction differences of different turbulence models on the sealing performance of labyrinth seal, the discharge coefficient and static temperature rise are used to compare the experimental data for analysis. The experimental conditions are at room temperature. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of experimental data and simulation results for different turbulence models at Ta/Re = 0.141. Even if the predicted value overestimates the discharge coefficient of the labyrinth seal with an error of 10.72 %, it still meets the engineering requirements. However, DES and LES showed more accurate prediction performance, with errors of 1.71 % and 1.77 %, respectively. Meanwhile, Wein et al. [10] pointed out that LES can better predict the flow in the labyrinth cavity. While both DES and LES deliver substantially more accurate predictions of the discharge coefficient, the analysis of static temperature rise presents a more nuanced perspective. DES exhibits the closest agreement with the experimental temperature measurements. Although the temperature prediction errors for RANS and LES are comparable in magnitude, it is important to recognize that LES achieves this through a fundamentally different and more physically realistic representation of unsteady flow structures. Consequently, DES and LES are confirmed as more reliable tools in labyrinth seals.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Comparative analysis of flow field
4.1.1. Flow field analysis
To investigate the influence of turbulence models on the flow in labyrinth cavity, Fig. 8 shows the mean streamline distribution under different operating conditions and turbulence models. Compared with RANS, the vortex structures in the first labyrinth cavity simulated by DES and LES are considerably more intricate. This complexity arises from the differing jet strengths predicted at the first gap outlet. The RANS model tends to overestimate the jet intensity at this location, resulting in a vortex system dominated by vortex 1, vortex 2, and vortex 3. In contrast, DES and LES reveal that the direct penetration of the jet into the cavity compresses the available vortex space, confining vortex 2 and vortex 3 to the left side and generating vortex 6 in the upper right corner. The vortex structures and distributions within the second cavity are generally consistent across all cases, though their scales vary.

As operating conditions change, the cavity flow is jointly governed by centrifugal buoyancy and centrifugal force. Due to the cooling channel, the low-density fluid is driven toward the wall by centrifugal buoyancy. The cooling channel refers to the region within the labyrinth seal where the high-temperature leakage flow passes over the relatively low-temperature wall surfaces. As the leakage jet impinges on and slides along these cooled walls, its temperature progressively decreases, effectively forming a cooling passage driven by the convective interaction between the hot leakage stream and the colder solid boundaries. At low Ta/Re, the inertia-driven main circulation remains weak, allowing buoyancy forces arising from a large temperature difference to dominate the secondary flow and alter the inner recirculation cell. With the increased Ta/Re, centrifugal force and circumferential momentum scale accordingly, strengthening the primary vortex and suppressing centrifugal buoyancy-driven motion. As a result, the vortex core migrates outward, and the flow field becomes predominantly controlled by centrifugal force rather than centrifugal buoyancy effects.
However, the transition conditions between centrifugal buoyancy and centrifugal force predicted by RANS differ from those captured by DES and LES. Moreover, RANS predicts that the interaction between centrifugal force and centrifugal buoyancy affects only the first labyrinth cavity. Initially, due to the influence of centrifugal buoyancy, vortex 1 shifts to the lower left corner, displacing vortex 2 to the right. At Ta/Re = 0.541, centrifugal force becomes dominant, causing vortex 2 to rise and gradually compress vortex 1 until vortex 1 merges with vortex 3. DES and LES, however, show that vortex 3 first moves leftward and then rightward under the coupled effects of centrifugal buoyancy and centrifugal force, leading to a corresponding change in the size of vortex 2. Similar variations are observed for vortices 4 and 5, while vortex 6 is progressively compressed until it disappears entirely. These findings indicate that DES and LES exhibit higher sensitivity in capturing the intricate interaction between centrifugal force and centrifugal buoyancy.
The evolution of the jet region mirrors the vortex dynamics within the cavity. Fig. 9 shows the dimensionless mean velocity distribution under different operating conditions and turbulence models. The black line in Fig. 9 represents the variation of the leakage jet intensity at the gap outlet. It helps reveal how different turbulence models influence the decay, spreading, and deflection of the leakage jet as it convects into the downstream cavity. Since RANS predicts an excessively strong jet, the vortex modifications induced by centrifugal buoyancy exert little influence on its behavior. As centrifugal force becomes more significant, the rise of the cavity vortices enhances momentum exchange between the jet and vortex regions and increases wall friction, leading to a reduction in jet intensity. The initial vortex structures predicted by DES and LES undergo only slight changes, which minimally affect the jet. Both DES and LES predict an inclined jet, which gradually deflects as the vortex rises, thereby enhancing the axial kinetic energy of jet.

Fig. 10 shows the comparison of the square of time-averaged axial velocity at the first gap outlet under different operating conditions and turbulence models. At low Ta/Re, DES and LES predict axial kinetic energy values at least 25.40 % lower than those of RANS. At higher Ta/Re, as the RANS-predicted axial kinetic energy decreases and that of DES and LES increases, the discrepancy narrows to approximately 6.84 %. It indicates that the oversimplified vortex structures and overestimated jet intensity predicted by RANS lead to an exaggerated leakage prediction, which verifies the above analysis.

4.1.2. Vortex interaction and evolution
The instantaneous flow field within the labyrinth seal cavity is vividly captured through the Q-criterion iso-surfaces and cross-sectional vorticity contours in Fig. 11, Fig. 12. It unveils a highly dynamic and intricate system of vortex interactions that dictate the sealing mechanism. The evolution of these coherent structures transcends simple advection, involving intense nonlinear interactions that fundamentally distinguish the DES and LES from the steady-state perspective provided by the RANS model.

The vortex dynamics undergo a distinct spatial evolution, which can be traced from the upstream to the downstream region of the cavity. The primary mechanism driving the flow unsteadiness is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the shear layer emanating from the upstream fin tip. The high-velocity jet exiting the narrow gap shears against the nearly stagnant fluid in the cavity, resulting in an extremely high vorticity layer. This shear layer rapidly destabilizes, rolling up into discrete, counter-rotating vortex cores. In three dimensions, these structures form vortex tubes and nascent vortex rings that are shed periodically into the cavity. As these nascent vortices are advected downstream by the mean flow, they are subjected to severe vortex stretching due to the strong velocity gradients in the cavity. This stretching process, visible as the elongation and thinning of vortex structures, intensifies their vorticity and amplifies their turbulent energy. The core of the vortex evolution is its nonlinear interaction, a process entirely absent in RANS simulations. The Q-criterion iso-surfaces clearly show vortex breakdown and interaction. Adjacent vortices of similar rotational sense translate close to each other, merging to form a larger, more energetic structure. Large coherent structures become unstable and break down into smaller fragments upon impacting the downstream fin surface or through interaction with other vortices. These interactions are highly efficient mechanisms for energy redistribution across different turbulent scales and are responsible for the intense mixing observed within the cavity.
This continuous cycle of vortex generation, interaction, and breakdown is the primary source of aerodynamic loss within the seal, directly impacting the leakage rate by dissipating the kinetic energy of the leaking jet. The ability of DES and LES to resolve this entire process physically explains their superiority over RANS models.
4.1.3. Turbulence characteristics and energy transfer
Beyond the mere identification of coherent structures, a rigorous quantitative assessment of turbulence statistics is indispensable for evaluating model fidelity. This section contrasts the predictions of Reynolds stresses and the turbulence energy cascade, elucidating the fundamental differences in how RANS, DES, and LES represent turbulent flow physics.
The Reynolds stress tensor serves as a direct measure of turbulent momentum transport and provides insight into the anisotropy of the flow. Fig. 13 shows the distributions of Reynolds stress u′v′ for different turbulence models. The RANS model, founded on the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity hypothesis, computes Reynolds stresses as linearly proportional to the local mean strain rate. This yields a smooth, spatially diffuse stress field. By construction, the model assumes local isotropy, thereby failing to represent the strongly anisotropic, shear-dominated, and vortical structures that characterize the cavity flow. In striking contrast, the DES and LES resolve a substantial portion of the Reynolds stresses directly from the instantaneous velocity fluctuations. DES and LES results reveal thin, sharply defined sheets of intense shear stress, pinpointing regions of vigorous turbulent mixing and momentum exchange.

In RANS, the entire turbulence energy cascade is represented solely through modeled production and dissipation terms, yielding a closed balance that attains a statistically steady state but offers no physical insight into the spectral energy transfer or its spatial evolution. In LES, the energy cascade is inherently captured: large eddies extract energy from the mean flow, transfer it through nonlinear interactions to progressively smaller scales, and the residual unresolved scales are dissipated by the subgrid-scale (SGS) model. The spatial distribution of SGS dissipation can be mapped to reveal where energy ultimately exits the resolved spectrum. DES, as a hybrid method, replicates LES-like behavior in separated regions while reverting to RANS near solid boundaries. Fig. 14 shows the velocity power spectrum of P1 in the cavity. The high-frequency region of the DES and LES spectra displays a distinct inertial subrange with a slope consistent with the Kolmogorov −5/3rd-power law, confirming that the cascade of turbulent kinetic energy from the largest energetic structures to the dissipative scales is accurately captured. This enables first-principles prediction of mixing, momentum transport, and energy dissipation. By contrast, the RANS highlights its inability to capture the physics of unsteady energy transfer, an inherent limitation that underpins its large deviations in predicting separated and vortical flow.

Ultimately, the RANS model offers only a smoothed, statistically averaged portrayal of turbulence, incapable of capturing the anisotropic, intermittent, and structure-driven nature of the true flow field. Its dependence on the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity hypothesis and fully modeled dissipation precludes accurate representation of the intricate turbulence mechanisms within the seal cavity. DES and LES, on the other hand, resolve the dominant energy-containing motions, faithfully reproducing the Reynolds stress distribution and the physical energy cascade. This capability is indispensable for pinpointing where and how turbulent mixing, momentum exchange, and aerodynamic losses occur. It is an essential prerequisite for precise predictions of leakage behavior.
4.2. Comparative analysis of heat transfer
4.2.1. Nusselt number distribution
The convective heat transfer characteristics within the labyrinth seal cavity are quantitatively evaluated using the Nusselt number. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the circumferentially averaged local Nusselt number under various operating conditions, representing the mean value of the local Nusselt number at each axial position. It reveals profound differences, not only in magnitude but also in the spatial structure, which are directly attributable to their capabilities in resolving the unsteady flow physics. Compared with DES and LES, at Ta/Re = 0.141, the Nusselt number on the rotor surface of the first cavity is underestimated by 20 %–110 %, and the second cavity is underestimated by about 20 %. And the peak value is offset, which is caused by the inconsistency of the simulated flow. At Ta/Re = 2.600, this error is reduced to less than 42 %, and the peak position tends to be consistent. For the fin tip, the Nusselt number is not much different. For the stator surface, different turbulence models capture three peak points. However, the RANS model has an uncaptured peak point located in the first cavity, and there is almost no error in other regions. This is because the instantaneous heat transfer during a vortex impact event is extremely high. Scale-resolving simulations capture these events, and their contribution is retained in the time average. RANS, which only models the time-averaged flow, smooths out these peaks and systematically underestimates the maximum thermal load. This underestimation by RANS is non-conservative and risky for mechanical design. A thermal-structural analysis based on RANS predictions would underestimate the peak wall temperatures and thermal stresses, potentially leading to an under-designed component prone to premature failure via thermal fatigue cracking.

Fig. 16 shows the mean Nusselt number contour for different turbulence models. The RANS model produces a remarkably smooth and homogeneous Nu distribution. The high heat transfer regions are typically broad, featureless patches. It may predict a general area of enhancement in the impingement zone but fails to capture any fine-scale structure. The distribution is dictated almost exclusively by the time-averaged velocity field and the modeled turbulent diffusivity, which inherently smooths out all intermittent high-heat-flux events caused by unsteady vortices. In stark contrast, the DES and LES yield a highly heterogeneous and structured Nu field. The presence of sharp, localized streaks and spots of very high Nu. These are not numerical artifacts but the direct signature of coherent vortex actions. With the increased Ta/Re, the circumferential uniformity of Nu gradually improves across all models, reflecting the transition toward a more homogenized thermal field at higher rotational speeds.

4.2.2. Shear layer and flow correlation analysis
The accurate prediction of wall heat transfer is intrinsically linked to the fidelity of the near-wall flow resolution. This section delves into the characteristics of the wall-bounded flow and the development of the shear layer, providing the mechanistic connection between the vortex dynamics and the resulting Nusselt number distribution. The wall shear stress distribution serves as a direct indicator of the flow behavior immediately adjacent to the wall.
Fig. 17 shows the mean wall shear contour for different turbulence models at Ta/Re = 0.141. The RANS simulation predicts a smooth and broadly distributed wall shear stress field. The variations are gradual, reflecting the time-averaged, diffusive approach to turbulence. It identifies regions of high shear, such as near the fin tips and the flow reattachment zone, but lacks any fine-scale structure. This results in an overly homogeneous representation of the wall flow, failing to capture the intermittent, high-shear events caused by passing vortices. The DES and LES reveal a highly structured and intermittent distribution. The time-averaged contours show thin streaks and spots of intense shear that are spatially correlated with the trajectories of the resolved coherent vortices. As a vortex travels near or impinges on a wall, it induces a strong local acceleration of the fluid, leading to a sharp spike in shear stress. This pattern is the unambiguous footprint of vortex-wall interactions. The high-shear streaks directly trace the scouring action of vortices as they sweep along the cavity walls and the fin surfaces.

Fig. 17. The mean wall shear contour for different turbulence models at Ta/Re = 0.141.

This analysis of wall shear stress and shear layer development provides the critical link for interpreting the differences in heat transfer predictions. The coherent vortices generated by the upstream shear layer instability are the primary drivers of heat transfer augmentation. Acting as efficient carriers of high-momentum fluid from the jet core toward the near-wall region, they steepen velocity gradients and thin the thermal boundary layer. Upon impingement, they violently disrupt the boundary layer, triggering short-lived but intense local heat flux peaks. Because the RANS model cannot resolve vortex generation or impingement events, it completely misses this dominant enhancement mechanism. Instead, it relies on a uniformly increased but spatially smoothed turbulent thermal diffusivity to approximate the average effect, systematically underpredicting the true peak thermal loads associated with transient vortex impacts.
4.3. Comparative analysis of thermodynamic irreversibility loss
A deeper understanding of loss mechanisms can be gained by analyzing irreversibility through the second law, which directly quantifies the flow loss due to viscous dissipation and heat transfer across finite temperature gradients. Fig. 18 shows the entropy generation contour for different turbulence models at Ta/Re = 0.141. The RANS model produces a smooth and broadly distributed entropy generation field. High irreversibility zones around the fin tips and shear layers are identified but appear as diffuse clouds without fine-scale structure. The DES and LES simulations reveal a highly structured and concentrated distribution. However, this results in RANS overestimating the entropy generation due to heat conduction and viscosity in the labyrinth cavity.

Fig. 19 shows the proportion of each entropy production under different operating conditions and turbulence models. Heat transfer dissipation is the primary source of irreversibility (>73 %) in all models due to the large temperature difference. RANS predicts a higher contribution from viscous dissipation and a lower heat transfer irreversibility compared to DES/LES. This discrepancy arises from fundamental modeling differences. The elevated turbulent viscosity predicted by RANS smears velocity gradients, producing enlarged regions of moderate viscous dissipation while attenuating peak local values. Simultaneously, RANS underpredicts the sharp thermal gradients generated by unsteady vortex mixing, leading to a systematic underestimation of heat transfer irreversibility. By resolving these unsteady vortical structures, DES and LES more accurately capture the true distribution and intensity of thermal losses. The analysis of thermodynamic irreversibility conclusively demonstrates that high-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding the fundamental loss mechanisms in labyrinth seals. While RANS can identify general high-loss regions, it misrepresents the spatial distribution and quantitative partitioning of losses. The consistent under-prediction of heat transfer irreversibility by RANS further underscores its limitations for high-fidelity heat transfer analysis.

5. Conclusions
There is limited study on the flow and heat transfer analysis of interstage seals in high-pressure compressors of variable cycle engines. The performance of RANS based on k-ω model, DES, and LES for predicting the complex flow and heat transfer characteristics in a rotating square-cavity labyrinth seal is systematically evaluated. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of vortex dynamics, turbulent statistics, wall heat transfer, and thermodynamic irreversibility, the following key conclusions are drawn.
a)
DES and LES outperform RANS by accurately resolving unsteady vortex dynamics, including shear layer instability, vortex roll-up, stretching, and breakdown, capturing intricate vortex structures in the first cavity. The more accurate jet intensity predictions are provided, and the interaction between centrifugal force and buoyancy across cavities is revealed.
b)
Constrained by the Boussinesq hypothesis, RANS fails to capture turbulence anisotropy and intermittency, resulting in diffuse stress fields. In contrast, DES and LES resolve thin shear layers, reproduce the turbulent energy cascade with a clear −5/3 spectral slope, and facilitate physically grounded predictions of energy transfer.
c)
By resolving vortex impingement and sweeping, DES and LES reveal localized heat transfer streaks and higher peak Nusselt numbers, essential for accurate thermal load and durability assessment. RANS significantly underestimates peak loads and misplaces hot spots, posing non-conservative design risks.
d)
Entropy generation analysis shows that heat transfer loss dominates (>73 % of total). RANS overpredicts viscous losses and underpredicts heat transfer loss due to smeared gradients, while DES and LES capture the correct spatial distribution and loss partitioning.
e)
RANS is suitable for the rapid estimation of global parameters but exaggerates leakage predictions. For transient analysis, hot-spot prediction, and fundamental understanding of loss mechanisms, DES or LES are essential.
f)
Future study will focus on data-driven model corrections and machine learning-assisted turbulence modeling to overcome the inherent limitations of RANS in predicting anisotropic turbulence and unsteady phenomena.
This study aims to provide practical guidance for the selection and application of computational methods in designing compressor interstage seals, particularly under the high-temperature conditions encountered in variable-cycle engines. The findings offer crucial insights for enhancing the accuracy of thermal load predictions and leakage control strategies, which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity and operational efficiency of advanced compressor systems.
