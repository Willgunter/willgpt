Abstract
This study designed and built a multi-scale high-temperature and high-pressure (T > 140 °C, P > 2 MPa) superheated water experimental platform, and systematically investigated the BLEVE pressure characteristic parameters and their variation trends under different sizes of vessels, different release diameters, different initial temperatures, and different initial pressures. The results indicate that three distinct pressure-peak regions appear during the pressure rebound stage. Pressure peaks typically occur within the first two regions, where the energy released from the first peak significantly attenuates the second. Distinct critical relief diameters were identified for vessels of different sizes, with larger vessel volumes corresponding to larger critical diameters. Both excessive and insufficient vent diameters can suppress the occurrence of BLEVE. An increase in initial temperature and pressure shows a positive correlation with the BLEVE peak pressure, while the initial pressure exhibits an exponential influence on the peak value. In addition, the larger the volume, the larger the pressure peak generated after venting, and the maximum pressure peak occurs in Vessel I, which is 4.14 times the initial pressure. Overall, this study elucidates the formation mechanism of the multimodal pressure response during BLEVE, providing experimental evidence to support the safe design, operation, and risk mitigation of high-temperature and high-pressure vessels.

1. Introduction
High-temperature and high-pressure vapors are frequently employed in industrial heat transfer processes due to their substantial specific heat capacity. However, during transportation and operation, if a pressurized vessel is exposed to external impact, fire, or other incidents leading to damage, it can trigger a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE), potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for production[[1], [2], [3], [4]]. During the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) production process, the surface and technical layers are subjected to prolonged exposure to high-temperature steam injection (T > 260 °C) and high-temperature, high-pressure production environments, inevitably resulting in a decrease in the structural integrity of the wellbore. Once the wellbore experiences damage, a BLEVE is likely to occur, and the resulting pressure rise from this physical explosion may lead to safety incidents, including abnormal wellhead lifting, leakage, and casing fracture, severely jeopardizing both personnel and property safety[[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]].
In high-temperature and high-pressure superheated water systems, BLEVE events are typically initiated by local structural failures or the rupture of weak points in the pressure vessel [10,11]. Once the container ruptures, the rapid expansion of the internal high-pressure steam and the intense flash evaporation of superheated liquid water generate a two-phase jet flow with high kinetic energy. The heat transfer, mass transfer, and phase change dynamics involved in this process are strongly influenced by the initial conditions of the medium (e.g., initial temperature and pressure), the structural characteristics of the vessel (e.g., volume and geometry), the failure parameters (e.g., rupture location and vent diameter), and surrounding environmental conditions [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. These factors interact and couple to determine the degree of steam expansion, flash evaporation rate, and two-phase flow impact intensity, thereby directly influencing the amplitude and duration of pressure peaks during the BLEVE process[[16], [17], [18], [19]].
To investigate the overpressure characteristics of BLEVE and its associated disaster mechanisms, numerous researchers have conducted both experimental and numerical studies. Extensive investigations have been carried out on the BLEVE behavior of flammable substances such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). For these substances, BLEVE not only involves the rapid release of a high-pressure two-phase flow following vessel rupture but may also lead to a secondary explosion of vapor clouds [3,20]. Previous studies in this area have mainly focused on the effects of thermal stratification and filling levels on relief overpressure, BLEVE pressure responses in tunnels, the multifactor coupling mechanisms governing tank failures, and the occurrence of secondary explosions following BLEVE[[21], [22], [23]]. Research involving water, CO2, and other extinguishing agents has primarily examined the mechanisms of BLEVE initiation, jet flow characteristics, near-field overpressure influences, and thermodynamic responses. In addition, the effects of impurities on BLEVE overpressure in single-component systems have been explored. Some scholars have further employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to estimate BLEVE overpressure, comparing the results of numerical and empirical models with experimental data[[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]].
Abbasi et al. [3] argued that if boiler explosions that occur when storing superheated water are included in BLEVE counts, then the most commonly involved substance in BLEVE is likely to be water. Water has also been a key catch for scholars studying BLEVE because of its economy, universality, and ease of access. Luo et al. [23] investigated the effect of filling rate and fire engulfing area on the rupture of storage tanks through fire experiments on small liquid storage tanks and combined the parameters of pressure-temperature response and damage form to give a prediction of the BLEVE. Heymes et al. [22] used a 14 L pressure vessel and designed it for a high superheat condition (290 °C; 75 bar). They found that the superheated water would produce a large overpressure peak at the relief port, which was highly anisotropic. They concluded that the first pressure peak was generated by pre-existing vapor expansion, that the fill rate did not affect liquid boiling, and that the vent was proportional to the overpressure. Chen et al. [34] studied the effect of two-phase flow on the vessel pressure during the explosion process by using pure water as the test medium and concluded that the larger the liquid superheat, the stronger the rise of overpressure. Ren et al. [35] revealed the correlation between the dynamic pressure at the top of the vessel and the two-phase flow expansion and injection process by visualizing the boiling of superheated water in a vertical vessel. It was found that the two pressure peaks had different characteristics, and the first one was higher than the second one, but the duration was shorter. In addition, Ren et al. [36] designed a small-scale full-field visualization experimental setup with horizontal vessels, in which the boiling and expansion processes in horizontal vessels exhibit characteristics similar to those in vertical within two-phase flow, except that the difference in rupture position can significantly affect the pressure rebound characteristics: when the rupture location is in the middle, the effect is much greater than that when it is close to the side. Shang et al. [37] carried out a mechanistic study of superheated water burst boiling under different conditions, they used rupture discs to simulate weak links, discussed the effects of rupture disc position and diameter on two-phase boiling, and explored the influencing factors and laws of critical level difference.
From the above literature review, it can be seen that although domestic and foreign researchers have conducted extensive research on BLEVE of water[11,12,19,[38], [39], [40], [41], [42]], there are still several shortcomings: 1) insufficient research on container size effects. Existing research is mostly based on single size containers, making it difficult to reveal the impact of volume changes on release rate and peak pressure amplification effect; 2) The influence of initial temperature, initial pressure, and discharge diameter has not been systematically revealed, and existing research lacks a systematic collaborative analysis of the three; 3) The experimental data under high temperature and high pressure conditions are relatively insufficient, and most BLEVE experiments mentioned in the literature have low initial temperatures and pressures. The pressure response and two-phase flow structure in high-energy density environments have significant differences, and the relevant experimental data is not yet sufficient.
In response to the identified shortcomings, this study aims to elucidate the mechanism of high-temperature and high-pressure superheated water BLEVE in multi-size containers, as well as the influence of different initial conditions on pressure characteristics. For this purpose, we designed and built a high-temperature and high-pressure (T > 140 °C, P > 2 MPa) superheated water experimental platform. By analyzing the instantaneous response of temperature and dynamic pressure inside the container, the BLEVE mechanism of high-temperature and high-pressure steam in different scales and the influence of various initial conditions on its severity were revealed. The research results provide a theoretical basis and data support for preventing overheating BLEVE accidents and investigating the causes of such accidents in industrial environments and daily life.

Fig. 1. Experimental system.

The pressurized vessel is a stainless steel horizontal cylindrical tank, and in order to study the effect of volume effect on BLEVE, three tanks with different volumes were designed with specific parameters shown in Table 1. The wall thickness of the tank is 2 cm, the maximum working pressure is 30 MPa, and there are openings below one side and above the other side of the vessel for gas intake and evacuation, respectively, and the pressure relief rod is installed in the center of the vessel. For safety reasons, no observation window was set up in this experiment, and conventional strength glass cannot withstand such high pressure. The gas injection system includes a boosting device and steam generator. This study through the use of HG-2-type CO2 boosting device in the high-pressure injection pump device to boost the experimental medium, the device working pressure: 0–50 MPa; fluid flow: 0–50L/h; total power: 6 kW; power supply: AC380V50Hz; steam generator using a new type of dual-heating pipe, steam pipe double helix winding Structure, the use of high thermal conductivity of the metal material thermal conductivity, the outer side of the ceramic fiber blanket insulation material insulation, can produce the maximum steam temperature of 275 °C, the maximum injection flow rate of 8 kg/h, the maximum injection pressure of 22 MPa.

Since the pressure in the BLEVE changes drastically between a few milliseconds [6], the model KD2006A dynamic pressure transducer is selected, with a sampling frequency of 500 kHz, a measurement range of −30 MPa–30 MPa, and an operating temperature range of −40 °C–250 °C; both the dynamic pressure transducer and the static pressure gauge are mounted on the pressure relief rod. In order to better simulate the actual working conditions, the rupture disc pre-pressure rupture method is chosen in this study, which can better control the initial pressure and leakage diameter before pressure relief and improve the accuracy of the experiment. The pressure relief device mainly consists of a rupture valve, LP-type rupture discs, and clamps, according to the experimental selection of different design pressure diameters of the rupture disc. The temperature sensor is a K-type armored thermocouple, model WRNK-191, with a temperature range of 0∼1100 °C, which is placed at the bottom of the vessel. In order to better simulate actual working conditions, the pre-pressure rupture method of the rupture disc was adopted in this study. This method allows better control of the initial pressure and leakage diameter before pressure relief, thereby improving experimental accuracy. The pressure-relief device mainly consists of a rupture valve, LP-type rupture discs, and clamps. Rupture discs with different design pressures and diameters were selected according to the experimental requirements. The synchronous triggering device was independently developed by the Beijing Institute of Technology. It primarily includes an MCU microcontroller and a synchronous level signal output port. When BLEVE occurs, the enormous kinetic energy generated by the two-phase flow breaks the enameled wire placed on the rupture valve, generating a circuit-break signal that is transmitted to the synchronous trigger. The MCU microcontroller then outputs a synchronous level signal for data acquisition. The entire device is installed inside the control room and connected to a multi-channel data acquisition system [43,44].
The overall experimental procedure is as follows.
First, the control panel of the steam generator was set to determine the heating temperature of the water and the outlet temperature of the fluid. The system was preheated to the specified temperature, after which the pressurizing device was activated. Water was pumped into the high-pressure injection pump through a hose, where the pressure was increased and transferred via the pipeline to the steam generator. The steam generator then heated the water into a high-temperature, high-pressure state. The superheated water was continuously injected into the tank through the pipeline until the tank pressure reached the rupture disc's designed rupture pressure, at which point gas injection was stopped immediately.
When the internal pressure of the tank reached the rupture pressure, the rupture disc burst instantly, releasing the container medium. The enameled wire broke, the circuit was interrupted, and the synchronous trigger was activated. The pressure data acquisition system started recording with a negative delay of 5 ms and continued until the medium was fully discharged. The temperature recorder continuously collected internal temperature data in real time from the beginning to the end of the experiment. The static pressure gauge displayed the internal vessel pressure before and after medium release in real time, but it could not capture transient overpressure. It was mainly used by the operator to monitor general pressure changes within the vessel. After data collection was completed, the drain outlet of the container was opened to drain the remaining water from the tank. Simultaneously, the steam generator was turned on, and high-temperature steam was used to flush and insulate the tank. After the temperature stabilized, the steam generator and drain outlet closed. Finally, all testing systems were inspected, and the sensors were reset and recalibrated. If any sensors or data transmission lines were found to be damaged, they were replaced immediately in preparation for the next experiment.
In this study, three different sizes of vessels were compared with different relief pressures (2 MPa, 3 MPa, 4 MPa, 5 MPa), relief diameters (3 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm), and relief temperatures (140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C, 200 °C, 220 °C). The purpose is to investigate the release mechanism and characteristics of BLEVE generated by high-temperature and high-pressure superheated water at different volumes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. BLEVE pressure and temperature response at high pressure
Fig. 2(a)shows the temperature variation inside the container after the injection of high-temperature steam. For most BLEVE experiments, container rupture (or bursting-valve activation) is achieved through temperature increase [1,24,28,35,36,41]. This approach can effectively control the liquid filling rate and the initial pressure during release, but it cannot ensure temperature uniformity inside the container. In this study, a direct-injection method of high-temperature steam is adopted. Water is first heated to a predetermined temperature and then injected into the tank until the rupture-disc pressure is reached. This method maximizes control of temperature variables and closely approximates the BLEVE process that occurs in SAGD systems. The results show that the temperature first increases continuously with the injection of high-temperature steam and then drops sharply when BLEVE occurs. Because of the limited insulation inside the container, the injected high-temperature steam condenses on the inner wall and accumulates as liquid at the bottom under gravity. At this stage, both temperature and pressure inside the container gradually increase. As the injection continues, the pressure follows the saturated-steam curve. The rate of temperature rise slows down, shifting the gas–liquid equilibrium toward the liquid phase, as the condensation rate becomes lower than the injection rate. Owing to the near-incompressibility of the liquid, the gas-phase space above accumulates pressure rapidly, leading to a sharp increase in temperature. Finally, the pre-set rupture disc ruptures, and BLEVE occurs. This process is accompanied by the ejection of two-phase flow and a sudden pressure drop, resulting in a rapid decrease in temperature. The maximum cooling rate in the initial stage reaches 55.51 °C/s. This behavior is attributed to the Joule–Thomson effect during gas throttling and the onset of flash evaporation of high-pressure liquid water, which requires a large amount of latent heat of vaporization. After 51.53 s of release, the temperature inside the container decreases from 222.57 °C to 106.48 °C, a process completely dominated by the discharge of the gas–liquid two-phase mixture. Subsequently, the temperature rises by 24.62 °C within 37.84 s and then gradually cools at an average rate of approximately 0.095 °C/s. The temperature rise occurs because, after intense flash evaporation, the partial pressure of water vapor inside the container exceeds the saturated vapor pressure, slowing the evaporation of the remaining liquid. The steam condenses and releases heat, allowing the tank to transition from a thermally nonequilibrium state to equilibrium. Finally, as the remaining liquid slowly evaporates (limited by the heat-transfer rate) and the steam exchanges heat with the external environment through convection and radiation, the temperature gradually decreases until the tank reaches the saturation temperature corresponding to ambient pressure.

Fig. 2. Pressure and temperature response curves of BLEVE under high pressure.

Fig. 2(b) shows the pressure change curve for vessel Ⅰ with a relief caliber of 10 mm, an initial temperature of 220 °C, and an initial pressure of 4 MPa. The first pressure peak appears at 1.41 ms after the start of the relief, and this value is almost 1/100 of the BLEVE experiment in low pressure [35,36]. According to the trend of the curve, the dynamic pressure change during the high-pressure BLEVE discharge process can generally be divided into three stages. The first stage is the pressure rise phase, during which the pressure inside the vessel approaches the rupture-disc design pressure. The second stage is the pressure rebound phase, where the pressure drops rapidly from the initial value at point O to the lowest value at point L. This stage shows a more complex pressure evolution and a distinct rebound phenomenon. The third stage is the rapid relief phase, in which the dynamic pressure gradually rises again from the valley point L.
Fig. 3 illustrates the gas–liquid two-phase transition mechanism in the three peak regions of Stages 1 and 2. The following section further explains these three stages based on Fig. 3, Fig. 2.

Fig. 3. Mechanism of gas-liquid two-phase change.

In the first stage, with the continuous injection of high-temperature water vapor, the gas–liquid two-phase gradually fills the entire container. During this period, the internal pressure and temperature of the system continue to rise, and the phase equilibrium at the gas–liquid interface shifts toward the liquid phase. Part of the steam condenses, leading to the gradual accumulation of high-temperature and high-pressure liquid water inside the vessel. This process can be regarded as a nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition, in which heat and mass are transferred simultaneously. From the measurement perspective, the dynamic pressure sensor used in the experiment is highly sensitive to rapid transient pressure changes but exhibits a weak response to slow quasi-static pressure increases. Therefore, during the steam injection stage, the pressure–time curve typically presents a steadily rising trend rather than distinct pulsations.
In the second stage, the pressure inside the container reaches the nominal pressure of the rupture disc (after pre-calibration, the error of the nominal pressure is less than ±0.1 MPa and is therefore ignored). The rupture disc instantly bursts, creating a significant pressure difference between the inside and outside of the container. The medium is rapidly released, leading to a sharp pressure drop within approximately 0.2 ms (O1–A1). Subsequently, three distinct peak regions appear on the dynamic pressure curve, corresponding to the three main stages of the explosion process, as shown in Fig. 3(b). First, due to the extremely fast release process (O1–P3 occurs within only 6 ms) and the limited length of the pressure-relief rod, there is insufficient time for the medium to exchange heat with the surroundings. Therefore, this process can be regarded as adiabatic. Within approximately 0.5–0.8 ms after the rupture of the disc, expansion of the vapor space above the container generates the first pressure peak. Owing to the large inertia of the liquid and the finite timescale required for flash evaporation, transient impacts are mainly caused by the rapid expansion of steam within a very short period [22]. The second peak occurs between 1.1 ms and 1.8 ms after discharge. When the pressure-reduction wave propagates downward to the gas–liquid interface, it induces local phase-equilibrium instability. At this moment, the liquid water is highly superheated, since its temperature is much higher than the saturation temperature at the corresponding pressure. The liquid surface begins to flash and boil, forming a thin mist-like two-phase flow. The two-phase flow rapidly sprays upward, impacting the space above and compressing the expanding steam, thereby generating the second significant pressure-peak region. The appearance of these pressure peaks is generally considered to mark the onset of BLEVE. As the rarefaction wave further propagates downward, the liquid water at the bottom of the container enters a severely overheated state and undergoes heterogeneous nucleate boiling. The generated bubbles continuously rupture and coalesce, while the pressure drop caused by vapor release “fills” the upper region, forming the third pressure-oscillation zone. The amplitude of this third pressure peak is usually lower than that of the first two because the early-stage energy release significantly reduces the degree of superheating in the system. According to Chuang [24], there is a competition mechanism between gas release and liquid boiling expansion during this stage, which leads to the "backfill" of gas. The nucleating boiling of liquid repeatedly occurs during this stage, causing the dynamic pressure curve to oscillate and develop. Finally, the dynamic pressure oscillation decreases (P3-L), indicating that the medium inside the container further boils, the gas release rate accelerates, and the pressure reduction rate continues to increase.
In the third stage, the dynamic pressure reaches the valley point L. At this moment, the pressure-reduction rate inside the container attains its maximum value, after which the dynamic pressure gradually rises back to the zero position (L–H), taking approximately 718 ms. During this stage, the dynamic pressure between L and H remains below zero, indicating that although the pressure curve continuously increases, the rate of pressure reduction is still greater than the rate of pressure increase. The container is therefore in a state of unsteady pressure release. As the pressure gradually decreases, the gas-phase fraction in the two-phase flow also declines, and bubble growth, development, and collapse are suppressed. This inhibition further reduces both the medium release rate and the expansion rate. However, it is worth noting that the medium release rate throughout this process remains higher than the expansion rate. Since the vessel's design pressure is 30 MPa—much higher than both the initial pressure and the peak pressure generated by the BLEVE—the vessel does not sustain further structural damage or additional fractures. Moreover, as the experiment is designed with a fixed fracture size, part of the two-phase flow that fails to discharge retains high kinetic energy, causing the medium to continuously impact the inner wall of the discharge port. The expanding and impacting effects of the medium form a competitive mechanism with the draining effect, which is always dominant at this stage. Until the dynamic pressure curve back to zero, the vessel began to steady pressure relief.
Compared with the distinct pressure rebound and multi-peak characteristics observed in this study, the experimental results reported by Shang et al. [37] and Chen et al. [34] do not show significant pressure rebound or clearly defined peak stages in the pressure curve inside the container. This difference mainly arises from variations in experimental conditions and measurement systems. First, the working pressure and degree of superheating in their experiments are relatively low, making it difficult for steam expansion and liquid flash evaporation to generate a sufficiently strong dynamic-pressure recovery effect during the release process. Second, significant differences exist in the sampling frequencies of the pressure sensors used in different studies; lower sampling rates may fail to capture transient peaks lasting only a few milliseconds. In addition, differences in pressurization methods and vapor–liquid interface formation mechanisms can alter the temperature field and gas–liquid distribution structure inside the container, thereby influencing the dynamic-pressure response. Therefore, under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, the multi-peak pressure response becomes more pronounced, whereas under lower energy-density conditions, pressure changes typically exhibit a single peak or no apparent rebound. This comparison further demonstrates that the initial thermodynamic state and phase-transition kinetics play a decisive role in determining the dynamic-pressure response characteristics of BLEVE.
The pressure variation of BLEVE generated by superheated water under different initial conditions is analyzed below, and for controlling the variables, a medium volume of vessel II is first used for the study.
3.2. Effect of different influencing factors on BLEVE overpressure
3.2.1. Influence of the burst disc diameter on the overpressures
The release of high-pressure media in a storage tank is caused by the failure of a weak link, which is a prerequisite for the occurrence of BLEVE. In this experiment, the rupture disc diameter is used to approximate the actual rupture of the rupture disc, and the designed conditions and their typical parameters are shown in Table 2. Fig. 4 shows the definitions of the typical parameters, and it is believed that the BLEVE of superheated water occurs when the absolute amount of pressure rises 
 >0. In the case of other conditions that are the same, the rupture discs with pressure relief diameters of 3 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm were selected for the experiments.
:The difference between the maximum pressure rise and the initial pressure value inside the storage tank is called the peak pressure. It should be noted that the peak pressure will be the highest pressure after release.
:The difference between the minimum pressure drop and the maximum pressure rebound is called the absolute pressure rise value.
:The difference between the minimum pressure drop and the initial pressure value inside the storage tank is called the absolute pressure drop value.
:The time it takes for the pressure to decrease to its minimum value is called the pressure drop time.
:The time it takes for the pressure to rise to its maximum value is called the pressure drop time.
:The time during which the pressure rises beyond the initial pressure is called the duration of overpressure.

Fig. 4. Typical parameter definitions.

Fig. 5 shows the pressure curves obtained under different rupture-disc diameters. Except for the curve corresponding to a rupture-disc diameter of 3 mm, all pressure curves exhibit oscillatory behavior and display an inverse pressure rise. This may be because the relief diameter is too small. After the development of the two-phase flow and its impact on the vessel wall produce a pressure peak, the vessel still maintains a relatively high internal pressure. Consequently, the liquid water retains a lower degree of superheat, and nucleate boiling and flash evaporation proceed more slowly. The medium's discharge rate remains higher than the development rate of the two-phase flow, which ultimately leads to a gradual pressure decline rather than oscillatory evolution. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5, when the relief caliber is less than 10 mm, smaller diameters correspond to lower pressures in both the first and second peak regions. This occurs because the discharge diameter affects the gas expansion energy in the region formed after the rupture of the disc. The reduced expansion energy weakens the atomization layer generated by the pressure-drop wave transmitted to the liquid surface, resulting in a decreasing trend in both peak values. When the relief caliber reaches 15 mm, rupture of the disc causes a more complex turbulence pattern, increasing the pressure impulse in the first peak region and weakening the formation of the second pressure peak. This indicates a competitive mechanism between the two peak regions, where the energy release in the first peak significantly reduces the intensity of the second.

Fig. 5. Pressure curves due to different relief caliber of Vessel II.

Experimental observations show that the overpressure peaks appear only in the first two peak regions, indicating that steam expansion and the mist-like two-phase flow are the dominant factors responsible for the observed pressure rebound.
Fig. 6 shows the variation trends of pressure-characterization parameters for different rupture-disc diameters. In Fig. 6(a), both the pressure drop and the pressure-drop rate increase with rupture-disc diameter. The maximum pressure drop and pressure-drop rate occur at 15 mm, reaching 4.84 MPa and 53.75 MPa/ms, respectively. This is because a larger rupture-disc diameter results in a higher fluid-release rate, and the larger orifice can trigger a more complex gas-flow pattern, leading to an increase in pressure drop. In Fig. 6(b), both the pressure-rise value and the pressure-rise rate increase with rupture-disc diameter up to 10 mm, where they reach maximum values of 8.95 MPa and 21.78 MPa/ms, respectively. This is attributed to the fact that a larger relief caliber allows more gas to perform work on container expansion. As the pressure-reduction wave is transmitted to the liquid surface, a greater volume of superheated water undergoes rapid nucleate boiling within milliseconds. The impact of flashing vapor on the outlet wall also becomes stronger. When the rupture-disc diameter reaches 15 mm, the pressure-rise value decreases unexpectedly. This may be because the rupture opening is excessively large. Although the liquid phase retains significant conversion energy, the leakage effect of water becomes dominant, substantially weakening the impact of the two-phase flow on the vessel wall. Consequently, more liquid water is discharged without undergoing phase change or contributing effectively to the pressure rebound after phase change. As a result, the pressure-rise value decreases, and the overall peak pressure is reduced. Accordingly, it can be concluded that when the rupture-disc diameter is sufficiently large, the pressure-rise value becomes smaller than the pressure-drop value, and the peak pressure falls below zero. In this case, the process is completely dominated by medium leakage, and no BLEVE phenomenon occurs. Fig. 6(c) shows that the peak pressure first increases and then decreases with rupture-disc diameter, reaching a maximum at 10 mm. Therefore, 10 mm can be regarded as the critical relief caliber under the present conditions.

Fig. 6. Characteristic parameters of pressure at different burst disc diameter.

As shown above, the occurrence of BLEVE requires a relatively appropriate rupture-disc diameter, and the intensity of BLEVE is closely related to the size of the relief area. This phenomenon has also been observed in the experiments and simulations conducted by other scholars [28,38]. When the rupture-disc diameter is too small, both the release rate of the two-phase medium and the pressure-drop rate in the container are slow. The liquid before and after failure cannot experience a sufficient pressure difference within a short period, and therefore the liquid medium does not reach the degree of superheat required to trigger BLEVE. In this case, only a relatively mild release occurs.
As the rupture-disc diameter increases, the pressure inside the container drops sharply at the moment of failure. The liquid medium, now highly superheated due to the large pressure difference, undergoes rapid flash boiling, leading to BLEVE. The severity of BLEVE increases with the relief area within a certain range. It is worth noting that a larger discharge area accelerates the energy-exchange rate between the medium and the surroundings, resulting in stronger pressure fluctuations during the initial stage of BLEVE discharge. However, the pressure-boosting effect gradually weakens in the later stage of discharge. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 6, the duration of overpressure generally decreases with increasing relief caliber. When the relief caliber becomes excessively large, even though the liquid medium possesses sufficient conversion energy, the effects of rapid discharge and pressure reduction dominate. Under these conditions, BLEVE cannot occur.
3.2.2. Influence of temperature
The superheat of the liquid phase medium is closely related to the initial temperature and has a great influence on the intensity of the superheated water BLEVE. Table 3 shows Typical parameter values for different initial temperatures, with an experimental initial pressure of 5 MPa, a rupture disc relief diameter of 10 mm, and experimentally designed initial temperatures of 140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C, 200 °C, and 220 °C, respectively. The phenomenon of pressure rebound was observed in all of the experimental condition (see Table 4).

Fig. 7(a) shows the relationship between the pressure-drop magnitude, pressure-reduction rate, and temperature. The pressure-drop value exhibits a more pronounced sudden decrease between 180 °C and 200 °C, and the rate of change follows a similar trend. The overall duration of pressure reduction remains nearly constant. As mentioned earlier, the absolute amount of pressure drop during the early stage of BLEVE release depends on the rapid discharge of the gas-phase medium. Higher temperatures do not lead to a greater pressure drop or a faster pressure-reduction rate because higher temperatures result in higher superheat during release, causing the medium to undergo boiling expansion earlier. Fig. 7(b) shows an approximately positive correlation between pressure rise and temperature, while the pressure-rise rate first decreases and then increases with temperature, reaching its minimum value at 180 °C. This confirms the description in Section 3.1: the higher the temperature, the greater the degree of superheat in the medium after discharge, the more intense the nucleate boiling of the liquid, and the stronger the impact of the upward-converging two-phase flow on the vessel wall. At lower temperatures, gas-phase pressure relief dominates. As the temperature increases, nucleation and boiling of the liquid enhance the pressure-recovery effect, which counteracts the gas-phase pressure relief. This pressure-recovery effect becomes dominant between 180 °C and 220 °C. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the peak pressure remains almost unchanged between 140 °C and 180 °C but increases by 94.3 % and 144.9 % at 200 °C and 220 °C, respectively. In addition, thermal stratification is also an important factor influencing pressure recovery. In this experiment, the high-temperature steam injected into the tank first undergoes gasification and fills the container due to inertia. As steam injection continues, the internal pressure rises until it reaches the saturation pressure corresponding to the given temperature, at which point steam begins to condense into liquid water. At higher operating temperatures, water molecules are more active, and rapid internal heat exchange makes it difficult for thermal stratification to form. Under lower-temperature conditions, however, thermal stratification becomes more evident, which in turn affects the formation of the BLEVE pressure peak [41].

In summary, an increase in initial temperature—and thus in liquid superheat—means that more energy is involved in the release and phase-transition processes. Consequently, a greater amount of liquid medium participates in the phase transition, forming more two-phase flow. The increased two-phase flow is compressed within the narrow space above the liquid surface, resulting in greater impact forces on the vessel wall and a stronger pressure-rebound effect. Moreover, as the initial temperature increases, the formation of more two-phase flow also leads to higher medium leakage, more frequent wall impacts, and a longer duration of dynamic-pressure oscillation.
3.2.3. Influence of initial pressures
The following is the study of superheated water BLEVE under different initial pressures, where the rupture disc relief diameter is 10 mm, the experimental design has an initial temperature of 220 °C, and the initial pressures are 2 MPa, 3 MPa, 4 MPa, and 5 MPa, respectively.
Fig. 8 shows the effects of different initial pressures on the pressure-drop value and rate, the pressure-rise value and rate, and the peak pressure. Both the pressure-drop magnitude and the pressure-drop rate first increase and then decrease, reaching their maximum values at 4 MPa, with corresponding values of 4.39 MPa and 24.1 MPa/ms, respectively. This observation confirms the conjecture in Section 3.2.2 that higher superheat leads to earlier boiling and expansion of the medium, and that both temperature and pressure influence the overall relief process by affecting the degree of superheat. The pressure-rise value and rate both exhibit clear positive correlations with the initial pressure, reaching maximum values of 8.95 MPa and 13.35 MPa/ms, respectively. This indicates that as the initial pressure increases, the pressure difference before and after the sharp pressure drop becomes larger, allowing the superheated water to acquire more energy. Under conditions of constant temperature but varying pressure, a linear increase in pressure causes the gas–liquid equilibrium in the container to shift toward the liquid phase. Consequently, the amount of energy stored in the liquid water for phase transition increases, which accelerates the formation, coalescence, and discharge of two-phase flow. This process also leads to an increase in the pressure-rise rate, the absolute pressure-rise value, and the overall pressure amplitude. The peak pressure increases exponentially with the initial pressure, indicating that the initial pressure has a significant influence on the release process of superheated water. It may also exhibit a step change as the initial pressure increases: at 5 MPa, the peak pressure rises by 538.9 % compared with that at 2 MPa. From the perspective of phase transition, as the initial pressure increases, the equilibrium continuously shifts toward the liquid state, and the vapor space above becomes increasingly compressed. This results in greater energy accumulation under the same rupture-disc diameter and initial temperature.

The above experimental results indicate that within the tested range, the initial pressure has an exponential effect on the peak pressure, whereas the initial temperature exhibits an approximately linear relationship. The difference in their influence laws can be explained by the coupled mechanism of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, as follows.
When a high-pressure vessel ruptures, the instantaneous pressure drop generates a high-amplitude pressure-wave fluctuation. Such a disturbance destroys the original thermodynamic equilibrium of the liquid within an extremely short time scale, driving it into a highly nonequilibrium state. This process induces strong local shear, extensional deformation, and interphase interactions in the liquid, resulting in extremely high strain rates. The transient, high-speed flow field markedly enhances both the efficiency of bubble nucleation and the rate of gas–liquid interface fragmentation, enabling small-scale perturbations in the liquid to evolve rapidly into large-scale vaporization. From a quantitative perspective, the higher the initial pressure, the greater the pressure drop at the moment of rupture. According to classical nucleation theory [3,10,14], the nucleation rate is exponentially correlated with the pressure-drop amplitude. An increase in the amplitude of pressure drop therefore leads to an exponential rise in nucleation rate, which in turn causes a sharp increase in the instantaneous vaporized mass. The rapidly expanding vapor in the confined space ultimately drives the peak pressure to increase exponentially with the initial pressure.
In contrast, variations in the initial temperature primarily affect the liquid's degree of superheat—that is, the difference between its saturation temperature and the actual temperature corresponding to the current pressure. Within the experimental range, the influence of temperature on the internal energy and enthalpy of the liquid is approximately linear. Consequently, the released energy and the intensity of flash evaporation also increase linearly with temperature. This results in a nearly linear relationship between the peak pressure and the initial temperature.
3.3. Comparison of pressure response of multi-sized vessels
Fig. 9 shows the pressure change curves of the three vessels at an initial pressure of 5 MPa, an initial temperature of 220 °C, and a burst disc diameter of 10 mm. As shown in the figure, with the increase in the vessel volume, the pressure drop value shows an obvious upward trend, which can be attributed to the energy accumulation of the vapor space inside the vessel. The larger the volume of the vessel, the higher the energy accumulation in the vapor space above the superheated water, and the more drastic the gas venting. In addition, the larger the vessel, the longer the duration of the dynamic pressure change, and the frequency of the dynamic pressure curve becomes significantly smaller, culminating in the three pressure peaks evident in Vessel I-a similar phenomenon was observed in the experiments in Laboureur [2]. This is because the larger the container, the longer its length. After gas expansion and pressure reduction, the two-phase flow generated by liquid level atomization first completes pressure accumulation in the space above the tank. At the same time, the expansion effect of the steam space and the flash evaporation effect of the liquid are amplified, ultimately leading to the development of pressure wave stacking and gradually forming a relatively complete pressure peak curve. The peak pressure in vessel Ⅰ is 14.36 MPa, which is 2.87 times the initial pressure, indicating that the volume effect has a greater influence on the intensity of the BLEVE. Although the dynamic pressure curves of the three vessels are similar, the peak pressure has a tendency to decrease gradually, and it can be seen that the 
 < 0 in container III, which indicates that BLEVE does not occur. The following is a comparison of the peak pressure under the same operating condition in the three vessels.

Fig. 9. Pressure change curves in different vessels under the same initial operating conditions.

Fig. 10(a) clearly shows the effect of relief diameter on peak pressure in three kinds of vessels. It can be seen that in vessel I, the peak pressure increases with the decrease of burst disc diameter; In vessel III, the peak pressure decreases with the increase of burst relief diameter, and a similar situation also occurs in vessel II - the peak pressure of 15 mm is less than the peak pressure of 10 mm. This shows that the 3 mm relief caliber is too large for the smallest volume of container III, and the water discharge and pressure reduction effect has begun to dominate. Based on this, we believe that there are different critical points of relief caliber in vessels with different volumes. When the relief caliber is less than the critical relief caliber, the peak pressure increases monotonically; On the contrary, the peak pressure decreases monotonically. Unfortunately, we did not find the critical relief caliber of vessel I and vessel III. However, it can be determined that 3 mm discharge diameter is too large for vessel III and 15 mm is still too small for vessel I, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between the critical relief caliber of the container volume. In addition, in industrial production, crack maintenance should be paid more attention to the small volume high-pressure tank, because even a small gap will cause a large pressure rise.

Fig. 10. Effect of different initial conditions on peak pressure in different vessels.

Since 10 mm has far exceeded the critical relief caliber of vessel III, BLEVE could not occur, and to control the variables, subsequent comparisons were made only in two vessels, I and II. Fig. 10(b) shows the variation of peak pressure with temperature in the two vessels. It can be seen that the peak pressure is essentially linear up to 200 °C in vessel Ⅰ, with a sudden change at 220 °C, which is similar to that in vessel Ⅱ at about 180 °C, and the variability of this temperature inflection point may originate from thermal stratification in the vessel. This is also observed in the remaining two vessels in Fig. 10(c). This also indicates that the change in vessel volume does not affect the conclusions in 3.2, and that the increase in superheat caused by the pressure plunge is still the dominant factor in the BLEVE process. Fig. 10(c) also shows that the two curves show a clear exponential relationship, and the peak pressure generated by BLEVE is already 2.87 times the initial pressure for the large volume vessel I. This indicates that the large volume high-pressure vessel must be carefully guarded against BLEVE, and the overpressure generated by the relief is huge. In addition, the amplification ratio between the two vessels shows a gradually decreasing trend, which indicates that the effect of volume on BLEVE will be reduced after entering the high pressure range.
It is easy to see in Fig. 10 that the larger the vessel volume, the higher the resulting peak pressure: the overall pressure of Vessel I rises by 141.2 % at different temperatures, and the peak pressure of Vessel I is likewise generally higher than that of Vessel II at different pressures. This may be due to the fact that a larger vessel requires more superheated water to fill under the same initial conditions, while at the same time having more vapor space above it. After the rupture disc above the vessel ruptures, the steam space above dominates the process first, and the larger steam space accumulates more energy, which directly affects the formation of the peak overpressure. In summary, although the volume effect affects the pressure characteristic parameters of BLEVE, the general trend remains consistent.
In previous studies [2,11,17], BLEVE experiments at different scales and simplified energy-model analyses have shown that increasing the container size leads to an amplification of external overpressure due to the greater release of energy. These studies provide valuable references for assessing the external-field effects of BLEVE; however, their primary focus has been on estimating the intensity of the shock wave and the total energy released outside the container, without addressing the multimodal transient pressure response within the vessel. In contrast, the present study examines the internal pressure dynamics, offering complementary insights into the correlation between the internal pressure response and the multimodal structure of the external overpressure field. In addition, Duan [45] used thermodynamic models to predict the scale effects of a constant ratio of discharge area to container surface area and a constant ratio of discharge area to container volume, and concluded that increasing container size would reduce the rate of re-pressurization and weaken pressure rebound. But through our research, the larger the container size, the greater the pressure rebound, which may be related to our pressurization method: larger containers will inevitably be linked to larger gaseous compression spaces, resulting in larger pressure peaks.
3.4. BLEVE inhibition scheme
The results of this study demonstrate that the BLEVE process of superheated water in multi-scale containers under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions exhibits distinct stage characteristics and nonlinear response behavior. Based on the observed pressure-evolution mechanisms and scale effects, the following BLEVE mitigation strategies are proposed:
(1)
The strong expansion effect at the moment of rupture can be mitigated by controlling the release rate and discharge path. Experimental results indicate that the multi-peak pressure response in the second stage primarily originates from the coupled effects of rapid vapor expansion and liquid flash evaporation. Therefore, in engineering design, multi-stage pressure-relief or slow-release structures should be prioritized to stabilize the gas–liquid two-phase energy release process.
(2)
The study reveals that each container size corresponds to a specific critical pressure-relief diameter. Accordingly, in the design of high-pressure equipment, relief channels larger than the critical value should be selected based on container volume and operating conditions to avoid operation within the sensitive pressure-peak range.
(3)
The combined effects of initial pressure and temperature determine the rate of gas–liquid equilibrium transition and the intensity of phase change. Reducing the superheat of the liquid phase and maintaining a lower initial pressure can effectively delay flash evaporation and mitigate two-phase impact formation.
(4)
The volume effect significantly amplifies the peak pressure in large-scale containers. Therefore, for systems with high volume and high initial pressure, external cooling and thermal insulation should be integrated with automated controlled-release systems to reduce the rate of energy release per unit time.
4. Conclusions
This study carried out a series of experiments on the release process of superheated water in multi-scale containers by directly injecting high-temperature steam. The results revealed the correlations between the pressure–temperature responses inside the vessel and various initial parameters under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. The research focused on analyzing the mechanisms of dynamic pressure evolution, the scale effects of pressure relief, and the multi-peak response characteristics within the container, providing new experimental evidence for understanding the initial dynamic process of BLEVE. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1)
The dynamic pressure during the high-pressure relief process can be divided into three distinct phases: the pressure rise phase, the pressure rebound phase, and the rapid relief phase. The pressure peaks usually occur in the first two peak regions, and the energy released in the first peak region significantly weakens the second. In the third peak region, a competitive mechanism between gas release and liquid boiling expansion leads to partial gas “backfilling”.
(2)
Different scales in the vessels are different critical relief caliber, which is the media leakage and two-phase flow expansion and extrusion phase equilibrium results. When the pressure relief diameter is smaller than this caliber, the peak pressure monotonically rises; conversely, the peak pressure monotonically decreases until no BLEVE occurs. The vessel Ⅱ critical relief caliber is 10 mm, the vessel Ⅰ critical relief caliber is greater than 15 mm, vessel Ⅲ critical pressure relief diameter is less than 3 mm.
(3)
During BLEVE discharge, the pressure variation inside the vessel results from the coupling among medium discharge and pressure reduction, vapor-space expansion, and the pressure rise induced by two-phase flow impact. The initial pressure drop during BLEVE discharge is mainly governed by the discharge rate of the gas-phase medium. Increases in initial temperature and initial pressure drive the gas–liquid equilibrium in opposite directions; however, both ultimately accelerate the rate of pressure rise, leading to a pronounced increase in peak pressure.
(4)
The volume effect on the peak-pressure response of superheated-water BLEVE is significant, and the initial pressure exhibits an exponential influence on the peak pressure. Under identical operating conditions, larger vessel volumes produce higher peak pressures after discharge. The maximum peak pressure took in vessel Ⅰ, initial pressure 5 MPa, initial temperature 220 °C, and burst disc diameter 15 mm, which is 20.7 MPa, 4.14 times the initial pressure.
Based on a multi-scale experimental platform for superheated water, this study investigated the influence of various initial parameters on the dynamic pressure response during the discharge process under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, thereby revealing the formation mechanism of the multi-peak pressure rebound region in the BLEVE process. In addition, the critical relief diameters corresponding to different container volumes were determined, providing a quantitative basis for the design of relief channels, the selection of rupture discs, and the development of emergency discharge strategies for high-temperature and high-pressure vessels. The experimental data obtained in this work can serve as a foundation for constructing and validating numerical models of BLEVE under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Moreover, the findings offer valuable references for risk assessment and safety design of thermal recovery wellbore, boiler pressure vessels, and heat collection and transportation systems. However, due to the significant influence of the release-channel geometry and pressurization method on the peak characteristics of BLEVE, the applicability of the conclusions drawn in this study remains constrained by certain conditions. Further verification is required to extend the findings to more complex media systems, different container geometries, and larger volume scales.
Future research should focus on the following aspects. First, combining high-speed photography with flow visualization techniques to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of two-phase flow expansion and phase-interface rupture, thereby deepening the understanding of pressure-peak formation mechanisms. Second, coupling the experimental data with CFD-based multiphase flow models to establish a generalized predictive model for the internal flow field of BLEVE.
