Abstract
High-capacity lithium-ion batteries have been extensively adopted to extend the driving range of electric vehicles, resulting in more and more severe battery heating. The battery thermal management system is critical to the vehicle's dependability and longevity. An innovative capillary/honeycomb hybrid battery thermal management system (CH-HBTMS) associating bionic cooling channels with cellular cold plates is put forward to enhance the heat dissipation and mass grouping efficiency for prismatic lithium-ion cells. The bionic composite structure coupled multi-branch capillary with honeycomb increases the contact area and distribution uniformity between flow channels and cells, improves the dissipation capacity, which is conducive to the even and rapid heat transfer from the battery, and reduces the failure of phase change material at 40 °C. Compared with the traditional liquid cold plate, the mass grouping rate of the CH-HBTMS increased by 14.11 %. Here, the cooling properties of different cellular metal cooling plates and bionic capillary spatial flow channels are analyzed at 40 °C. A multi-objective optimization is conducted on the battery’s highest temperature, temperature difference, inlet–outlet pressure drop and the mass grouping rate with variables including the inlet mass flow rate, honeycomb plate thickness, porosity and flow channel wall thickness of the CH-HBTMS. The CH-HBTMS with optimal parameters can ensure that the battery’s temperature rises by only 3.38 °C and the cell–cell temperature difference is less than 2.84 °C under harsh conditions and exhibits an excellent heat dissipation performance. This work will help develop the energy-saving and lightweight BTMS for electric vehicles.

1. Introduction
Over the last two decades, electric vehicles (EVs) have been an increasingly essential primary solution to reducing exhaust emissions from traditional automobiles and the consumption of fossil fuel resources, which may help alleviate serious environmental pollution [1], [2]. The development of batteries for EVs is impeded by principal challenges such as cost, safety, cell energy density, charge/discharge rate, and service life [3]. Due to its outstanding merits including remarkable energy density, lengthy lifespan, and lack of charge memory lithium-ion battery (LIB) has become a crucial component extensively applied in many different types of EVs [4]. However, LIBs are highly vulnerable to operating surroundings, particularly excessively high or uneven temperatures, which shortens their service life [5]. Moreover, close attention should be paid to the safety issue induced by thermal runaway of batteries for it has triggered many perils of EVs [6]. The preferred working temperature scope for LIB is 20 °C–50 °C [7], so an excellent design of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) becomes the key to safeguarding the sound temperature control capacity of the cells under harsh conditions.
Current primary active cooling methods include forced air cooling [8] and liquid cooling [9]. The former was generally applied in early BTMS for its advantages such as simplicity in structure and cost-effectiveness. However, it cannot be applied in a high-rate discharge or high-temperature environment because of its weakness of low air thermal conductivity. By contrast to forced air cooling, liquid cooling is assumed to be a promising cooling approach for the liquid medium with a greater specific heat capacity and a larger thermal conductivity, thus being suitable for a compact system design [10]. The liquid cooling methodology is divided into direct and indirect systems. Direct cooling is characterized by immersion where the battery directly contacts the fluid [11]. In contrast, indirect cooling utilizes cold plate-based approaches, with cells in contact with the “heat exchanger” through a thermal interface material [12]. Among them, indirect liquid cooling is one of the most commonly used solutions for battery thermal management in the EVs application. Some researchers have conducted research on liquid cooling systems for batteries. An F2-styled liquid cooling system was designed using an M-shaped cooling plate configuration to restrict the cell temperature to a reasonable value at a low rate of charge and discharge [13]. An asymmetrical stacked D-2 liquid cooling structure was designed to reduce the volume, weight, and pressure drop of BTMS [14]. In addition, the coolant flow rate dramatically influences the thermal performance of the system [15]. Having been attracted by the excellent cooling performance of liquid-cooled BTMS many researchers have designed various cooling plate structures. Zuo et al. [16] proposed an improved cold plate with multi-channel and investigated the impacts of the ambient temperature, number of channels, oblique angle between channels, and mass flow rate on dissipation. Furthermore, Lai et al. [17] designed a novel Tesla valve microchannel and studied the influence of the amounts of Tesla valves and the channels, as well as the arrangement of inlet/outlet on the system with liquid cooling at 25 °C. The results confirmed the cell’s maximum temperature (Tmax) is less than 38 °C for the discharge current of 210 A. Besides, Ki et al. [18] proposed a power-saving BTMS by connecting multiple flow dividers in porous metal layers. It was reported that the cell’s Tmax, the maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax) can remain less than 43.4 °C and 2 °C with a flow rate is 3 L/min, discharge rate of 2C, and ambient temperature of 25 °C.
Being a passive cooling method, phase change cooling can take in and emit heat in the phase change process to ensure more excellent temperature uniformity of batteries by contrasted with liquid cooling [19]. The paraffin-based organic phase change material (PCM) is the most promising material with the merits of a large latent heat capacity, flexible geometric structure, non-toxic, and low cost [20]. The passive BTMSs with PCM have attracted extensive attention from many researchers but the issue associated with PCM thermal conductivity is a key to be solved [21]. Some researchers have proposed various methods to prepare composite phase change materials (CPCMs), such as diffusing PCM into the water with the aid of emulsifiers to make phase change emulsion [7], placing PCM into a porous skeleton with high thermal conductivity to prepare porous PCM material [22] and doping expanded graphite (EG) into paraffin to obtain solid EG/PCM [23], et al. EG/PCM has been applied in passive BTMSs for some outstanding advantages such as a simple manufacturing process and high thermal conductivity, and sound morphological stability to eliminate the leakage risk [24]. The thickness and EG mass fraction of CPCM have a dramatic impact on the system dissipation. Jiang et al. [25] evaluated the thermal behavior of a BTMS with EG/PCM and explored that EG as the additive significantly enhanced the heat conductivity of the pure PCM. Moreover, Zhou et al. [26] investigated the effects of the configuration, phase change point, and thickness of PCM on the thermal behavior of prismatic batteries, and found that the reduced phase change temperature and the increased PCM thickness helped improve the dissipation, but reduce the cooling efficiency where the thickness of PCM is over 25 mm.
Recently, efficient hybrid cooling methods abstract more attention from researchers and engineers, which combines active and passive cooling [27]. Among various hybrid cooling methods, hybrid liquid/PCM cooling can well combine the merits of the two approaches by liquid cooling and PCM cooling to improve the cooling capacity in a high-temperature environment [28], [29]. Fan et al. [30] raised a BTMS with PCM-liquid-TPMS and found that TPMS can effectively upgrade the heat conduction of PCM, and eliminate the thermal saturation in the PCM employing liquid cooling. However, liquid/PCM hybrid BTMSs generally are large in size, complex in structure, and expensive. To effectively upgrade the dissipation of hybrid BTMS and improve the battery mass grouping rate (η) researchers designed hybrid cooling plates [31], [32] and bionic cold plates [33], [34], which can reduce the mass of traditional cold plates and ensure the even temperature distribution. Additionally, the investigations on hybrid BTMSs for cylindrical batteries not only focus on the system’s cooling behavior, but also take the cell grouping rate and pump power consumption as optimization objectives, and adopted the multi-objective optimization algorithm to optimize the BTMS’ comprehensive performance [35], [36].
To sum up, forced air cooling generally is simple in structure and cheap, but the dissipation performance is limited. In contrast, liquid cooling is an approach more effective to enhance a BTMS’s heat dissipation, which can be better applied to a compact design under a high-temperature environment and high discharge rate. Compared with liquid cooling, phase change cooling can ensure an even temperature distribution of the battery, small mass, low system complexity, and maintenance cost of a BTMS. However, the heat accumulated in PCMs cannot be efficiently dissipated under harsh conditions, resulting in cooling failure caused by material completely melting. Through comparison, a pure cooling method has obvious limitations, while hybrid cooling combining active cooling with passive cooling can effectively upgrade the above cooling approaches. However, there are still some issues to be solved and the design of hybrid BTMS requires comprehensive consideration of heat dissipation efficiency, configuration complexity, cost, and space utilization. In addition, although the previous research on the hybrid or bionic cooling plate improved the thermal performance, there is great potential in the structural design of the cooling plate to decrease the BTMS’s weight and space. Moreover, it is worth noting that aforementioned the optimization on bionic BTMS is only carried out for the cylindrical battery with a single cooling system, but the multi-objective optimization of hybrid BTMS of prismatic batteries has not been carried out.
To address these gaps in the literature, an innovative capillary/ honeycomb hybrid battery thermal management system (CH-HBTMS) is proposed for prismatic batteries inspired by capillary and honeycomb structure, which combines the bionic capillary liquid flow channel (CLFC) with honeycomb cellular metal thermal sink (CMTS). Compared with the conventional hybrid BTMS with solid cool plate embedded PCM, the bionic composite structure coupled with a multi-branch capillary in the form of a honeycomb increases the battery contact area with flow channels and uniformly distributed coolant improves the heat transfer capacity, which helps heat dissipation from battery to the coolant evenly and rapidly and reduces the failure of phase change material in a high-temperature environment and enhances the mass grouping rate. The cooling behaviors of different cellular metal cooling plates and bionic capillary spatial flow channels are compared at 40 °C. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) is performed on the battery’s highest temperature, temperature difference, inlet–outlet pressure drop (ΔP), and mass grouping rate, and the optimal Pareto solution was obtained. An experimental setup was established and the tests were conducted on the prototype of the CH-HBTMS.
2. Models and methods
2.1. Geometry model
The CH-HBTMS three-dimensional geometric model is shown in Fig. 1, which is inspired by capillary and honeycomb structures. Capillaries transporting nutritious materials between blood vessels and the interstitial void of tissues play an important part in sending tissue environment, keeping microvascular system response in harmony, and controlling blood flow [37]. In the CH-HBTMS, a multi-stage bifurcated spatial flow channel based on the characteristics of the capillary was proposed, which have the advantages of wide distribution, small tube diameter, and wall thickness. Honeycomb is a natural structure, which has the advantages of being ultra-lightweight, high stiffness and strength, and good heat dissipation [22]. The honeycomb structure can enlarge the contact area of the thermal sink and decrease the BTMS weight. Therefore, the structural combination of capillary and honeycomb can significantly enhance heat dissipation performance and structure lightweight.

Fig. 1. The schematic of the CH-HBTMS.

The CH-HBTMS combining the advantages of liquid cooling and PCM and its spatial flow channel can better transfer and exchange nutrient ‘heat’ and minimize power consumption. Based on the capillary/honeycomb skeleton, CPCM filled into the gap of the honeycomb can effectively absorb and diffuse the heat to the thermal sink.
A 15 Ah prismatic lithium-ion battery (140 mm × 65 mm × 18 mm) is selected. The CPCM blocks embedded into the honeycomb are fabricated by adding 6 % EG into paraffin wax, which dramatically improves the heat conduction of the PCM and space utilization of the BTMS [25]. Silicone pads are attached to the battery surfaces and then inserted into the thermal sink to enhance the heat conduction and reduce the contact thermal resistance and the leakage risk of melted CPCM. Table 1 shows the specifications of the battery, silicone pad, thermal sink, and CPCM provided by the manufacturers.

In the investigation, the maximum mass flow rate of coolant, 1.0 g/s, yields a Reynolds number of 668.89 less than 2300, so the coolant flow belongs to laminar flow. The natural convection coefficient of the interface between the thermal sink and air is 5 W/(m2‧K) [44].

The convergence and calculation accuracy largely depends on the mesh quality. As key indicators, the battery’s Tmax, ΔTmax, and ΔP are monitored at 40 °C. The numerical simulation is performed with mesh numbers 501,352, 825,893, 1,162,901, 1,441,462, and 1,903,601. The battery's Tmax and ΔTmax stay consistent, and ΔP barely decreases by 0.01 % when the grid number increases from 1,441,462 to 19,030,601, as seen in Fig. 2(b). To ensure the simulation reliability and save computational resources, the grid number 1,441,462 is a proper choice.

According to Eq. (18), ε of CMTS with the circular, square and honeycomb holes are 54 %, 65 % and 71 %, respectively.
In this paper, a multi-stage bifurcation spatial flow channel based on the capillary is conducive to the uniform dispersion of the coolant to the cell surface, thus improving the cooling system's heat dissipation capacity. Additionally, a reasonable configuration of the flow channel and its inlets and outlets is helpful to enhance the dissipation of the system. Herein, five flow channel configurations are put forward in Fig. 3(b) to compare the cooling behaviors.
2.4.2. Experimental setup
To assess the cooling capacity of the CH-HBTMS, the physical experiments were performed to compare with the simulation at discharge rates of 1C, 2C, and 3C with an ambient temperature of 40 °C.
Fig. 4(a) illustrates the preparation of the CH-HBTMS. The thermal sink is manufactured by AlSi10Mg metal powder using selective laser melting 3D printer. The preparation process of CPCM is that the paraffin wax and graphite together were put into a beaker for heating with a thermostat and evenly stirred by a high-speed blender after weighing pure paraffin wax and expanded graphite with a mass ratio of 47:3 using an electronic balance. CH-HBTMS are first assembled by wrapping the battery tightly with a silicone pad and inserting it into the thermal sink. Then, the thermal sink was preheated and the liquefied CPCM was injected into the honeycomb gaps with a syringe. Finally, a spot welder is used to weld the battery electrode and the nickel sheet together.

The temperature measurement experimental platform for battery discharge is shown in Fig. 4(b). The main devices used in this platform include an internal resistance tester, charger, discharger, thermostat, multi-channel temperature tester, and liquid cooling system. To determine the internal resistance of the cell, use an internal resistance tester in the experiments. The charger and discharger be used to charge and discharge the cell. The thermostat can precisely adjust the ambient temperature. A temperature tester with sixteen channels was used to acquire temperature data from the monitor points during battery discharge. The liquid cooling system consists of the water tank, water pump, flowmeter, fluid pressure test unit, flow shunt, and rubber tube. The fluid pressure test unit can monitor the inlet or outlet liquid pressure of the flow channel. The flowmeter can regulate the channel’s incoming flow rate. The specification of this equipment is shown in Table 2. In the experiment, real-time temperature data were collected at five points on the battery surface, namely P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5.

2.4.3. Multi-objective optimization method
Fig. 5 shows the MOO process based on NSGA-Ⅱ for the CH-HBTMS is in. First, design variables and objective functions need to be selected. In this work, the sampling points of the variables are determined by Box-Behnken Design. Then, the objective function values can be derived based on the simulation results, thus the surrogate model be established by Response Surface Method [45]. Finally, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) [46] was adopted to seek out the best design variable combination of the surrogate model as shown in Fig. 5(a). NSGA-Ⅱ is a popular genetic algorithm for solving MOO problems because of the merits of running speed and convergence [47] and its solution process is illustrated in Fig. 5(b).

The combination of CPCM and CMTS is beneficial to distribute the battery temperature evenly and reduce the risk of liquefied CPCM leakage. Simulations were performed for three different configurations of CMTS illustrated, as indicated in Fig. 3(a), at a temperature of 40 °C and a discharge rate of 3C, and the results are presented in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. The battery thermal performance at different configurations of CMTS: (a) the battery’s temperature distribution contours; (b) CPCM liquid phase rate distribution contours (c) Tmax, ΔTmax and α at different configurations of cellular structure.

Fig. 6(a) illustrates the cell temperature distribution contours with the various CMTS configurations, Tmax of the three battery configurations are all distributed near the cell’s tabs due to the tabs being far away from the CMTS. The cell with honeycomb CMTS has the lowest Tmax while that with circular CMTS has the highest Tmax. Compared circular hole with the honeycomb hole, the battery’s Tmax decreases by 0.32 °C. The main reason could be that the volume of CPCM accounts for 67.54 %, 76.68 %, and 79.37 % of the total volume of the CMTS with circular, square, and honeycomb holes, respectively, so the honeycomb construction supply more space in the CMTS to store the CPCM than the other two types, which results in more heat from the battery absorbed by CPCM, thus the Tmax decreased. This can be proven by the reduction of CPCM liquid phase rate. The corresponding liquid fractions of CPCM for the three sorts of hole shapes are 0.90, 0.82 and 0.78 in Fig. 6(b) and (c), respectively. The lowest liquid phase rate of the honeycomb CMTS indicates the same amount of heat is sucked by more CPCM in the same discharge time.
The cell’s ΔTmax with square-hole is highest and that with honeycomb-hole CMTS is in the middle as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (c), while the battery’s ΔTmax with honeycomb CMTS is increased by 0.04 °C and decreased by 0.08 °C compared with that circular-hole and square-hole CMTS, respectively. The reason may be that in the three kinds of pore shapes, the contact area between the honeycomb hole and CPCM is less than that of the circular hole but larger than that of the square hole, resulting in a moderate ΔTmax.
Additionally, the porosity of honeycomb CMTS is the largest among the three configurations, which can save metal material to decrease weight and increase the mass grouping rate of the system. Therefore, the honeycomb CMTS is a proper choice.
3.2. The effect of cooling channel configuration
The CLFC is enabled to take away the battery heat quickly through high efficient ‘nutrient exchange’ effect and distributes the cell temperature uniformly. At Fin of 0.6 g/s, simulation calculation was carried out for five different CLFC configurations shown in Fig. 3(b), and the results are presented in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Cell’s cooling performance for different configurations of LCFC: (a) the temperature distribution contours of the battery; (b) the pressure distribution contours of the coolant; (c) the effects of flow channel configuration on Tmax, ΔTmax and ΔP.

The cell temperature distribution contours with different CLFC configurations are shown in Fig. 7(a). In three different cases with the same inlet and outlet arrangements, the battery’s Tmax reaches 48.72 °C, 48.17 °C and 47.64 °C, respectively, and ΔTmax are 6.67 °C, 6.26 °C and 5.95 °C, respectively. Tmax and ΔTmax of Case 3 are only 1.08 °C and 0.72 °C less than those in Case 1 because more capillary branches increase the contact area and distribution uniformity between the CLFC and the cell to improve the heat diffuse capability, resulting in a lower Tmax and ΔTmax. However, in Case 2, ΔP is the greatest, with a value of 19.03 Pa, while in Case 3, the pressure drop of 17.02 Pa is the smallest, as seen in Fig. 7(b) and (c). The reason could be that the CLFC configuration of Case 3 is preferred to decrease the flow resistance than others.
In addition, Fig. 7(a) and (c) also show the results of Case 3, Case 4 and Case 5 with various inlet/outlet arrangements. Tmax and ΔTmax in Case 4 are 47.88 °C and 5.98 °C, respectively, with the worst cooling effect on the battery. Tmax and ΔTmax in Case 5 are lower by 0.97 °C and 0.66 °C, respectively, compared with that in Case 4, because the inlet/outlet arrangement in Case 5 can efficiently increase the fluid flow rate in the channels to take the heat out of the battery in time, thus Tmax is reduced significantly. The diagonal inlet and outlet arrangement in Case 5 can distribute the cool liquid through the inlets more evenly than in other Cases, apparently decreasing the temperature raise effect along the channel to homogenize temperature distribution as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). Moreover, ΔP 36.66 Pa of Case 5 is greater than that in Case 3 but less than that in Case 4 as presented in Fig. 7(b) and (c). Despite a slight increase in energy consumption, Case 5 has the highest heat dissipation capability and is thus chosen for the study.
3.3. Thermal performance of the CH-HBTMS
Based on the optimal cellular structure and cooling channel configuration discussed in 3.1 Effect of configuration of cellular structure, 3.2 The effect of cooling channel configuration, the effects on Tmax, ΔTmax and α at a discharge rate of 3C and Fin of 0.6 g/s with the environment temperature of 40 °C for the CH-HBTMS with D of 1.5 mm, ε of 45 % and H of 0.8 mm were investigated, and the result serves as a reference sample to compare with the optimal CH-HBTMS in Section 3.4.3. Fig. 8(a), (b) and (c) illustrate the battery temperature, CPCM liquid fraction and liquid channel pressure distribution contours at Fin of 0.6 g/s, respectively. The lowest temperature on the cell surface is 41.31 °C around the flow channel inlet, while the highest temperature is 44.48 °C near the battery tabs as seen in Fig. 8(a). The ΔTmax between the inlet and outlet is 1.27 °C. In Fig. 8(b), the highest α of CPCM was observed at surface B while the lowest at the inlets of the flow channels, and the average α of the whole CPCM is 0.48. Fig. 8(c) shows that ΔP is 36.66 Pa, and the pressure around the center of the channel is mostly at about 17.45 Pa. Moreover, in contrast to the traditional BTMS with a solid liquid-cooled plate, η of the CH-HBTMS increased by 14.11 %. To sum up, the CH-HBTMS has an excellent thermal performance with a low pump power loss. The reason could be that the bionic capillary spatial flow channel effectively takes away the cell heat by the ‘nutrient exchange’ effect, and the honeycomb cellular structure combines liquid cooling with phase change cooling, which efficiently improves the internal heat exchange capacity of the CH-HBTMS.

3.4. Multi-objective optimization
3.4.1. Analysis of Variance
Appendix A shows the ANOVA results for the objective functions Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η. The of 
 and 
 in the objective function Tmax are 99.77 % and 99.92 %, respectively, and the difference between them is less than 0.2, indicating that the predicted and observed values are highly consistent. The 
 of Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η are 99.96 %, 99.28 %, 99.48 % and 99.71 %, respectively, indicating that the Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η variation is significantly affected by the variables of Fin, D, ε, and H. In addition, The F of the Tmax for the surrogate model is 2501.35, the P is less than 0.0001, and the AP is 143.167, indicating that the model is significant and capable of predicting Tmax. Similarly, the ΔTmax, P and η are predictable.
3.4.2. Surrogate model and response surface analysis
The surrogate model can be developed based on the flow chat in Fig. 5(a) to evaluate the objective functions. The functions of Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η are expressed as
(19)
It is observed in Fig. 9 that the actual values of Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η in the response surface surrogate model match well the predicted values, conforming to the established model's high accuracy and dependability in predicting the variations of the objective values.

Fig. 9. Comparison between predicted and actual results of RSM: (a) Tmax; (b) ΔTmax; (c) ΔP; (d) η.

The Tmax response surface contours of the interaction term reveal that Fin among the four variables has the greatest influence on Tmax, and Tmax decreases significantly with the increase of Fin as illustrated in Fig. 10. When Fin is about 0.7 g/s, the maximum battery temperature becomes a constant. H has a little effect on Tmax and in the range of 0.6 mm–1.0 mm, Tmax increases first slowly and then decreases. The impacts of D and ε on Tmax are significant, and Tmax rises with a decrease of D and an increase of ε. The main reason may be that liquid cooling plays a dominant role in hybrid cooling, while phase change cooling works auxiliary. Increased D and decreased ε lead to an increase in the mass of the metal skeleton in CMTS and heat transfer capability from battery to liquid channels, resulting in the reduction of Tmax.

The ΔTmax response surface contours of the interaction term shows that ε and D significantly affect the ΔTmax, while the H has little impact as seen in Fig. 11. The cell's Tmax decreases as Fin grows, and eventually becomes constant when Fin reaches 0.8 g/s. In addition, ΔTmax reduces with the increased D and decreased ε, and reaches a minimum at D of 2.0 mm and ε of 30 %. The reason could be that a large Fin equal to or greater than 0.8 g/s can more efficiently diffuse the heat in the CLFC, thus decreasing ΔTmax of the battery. The effects of D and ε on ΔTmax follow the same rule as Tmax.

Fig. 12 presents the ΔP response surface contours of the interaction term. The decreased H and Fin can effectively decrease ΔP. ΔP increases obviously when Fin and H are 0.8 g/s and 0.95 mm, respectively. However, the impacts of D and ε on ΔP can be neglected and no matter how to change D and ε with H and Fin set as a constant, ΔP remains identical since increasing Fin and H induce an increase in flow resistance, resulting in the flow pressure rising along the channel.

In Fig. 13, the η response surface contours of the interaction term denote that H, ε and D have significant effects on η. η decreases as H and D are increased and ε is decreased. When D, ε and H is 1.1 mm, 55 % and 0.6 mm, respectively, η is great because the metal density is much greater than that of CPCM, resulting in the metal mass being much greater than that of CPCM at the same volume fraction. Therefore, a reduction of the volume of the metal skeleton as much as possible is conducive to improving the battery grouping rate.

3.4.3. Multi-objective optimization
To determine the optimal variable combination, the minimized Tmax, ΔTmax and η and maximized ΔP are expected simultaneously, The MOO problem may be described based on the above surrogate model.
(20)
NSGA-Ⅱ is applied to optimize the variables, and the population and maximum iteration numbers are 150, and 300, as well as the crossover and mutation probability are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.
The Pareto frontier solution set obtained after 300 iterations of NSGA-Ⅱ is illustrated in Fig. 14. The optimal solution cannot be directly determined due to the contradiction between the minimum Tmax, ΔTmax and ΔP and the maximum η. According to the general requirement of the 3D printing process, the wall thickness of the thermal sink is equal or greater than 0.8 mm, and heat dissipation minimizing Tmax and ΔTmax, the final objective function values obtained in this paper are Tmax 43.93 °C, ΔTmax 2.92 °C, ΔP 42.15 Pa and η 75.07 %. The corresponding variable values are Fin 0.75 g/s, D 1.74 mm, ε 55.07 % and H 0.82 mm.

Fig. 14. Pareto optimal solution distribution.

With the optimal parameter combination, a numerical simulation result of the CH-HBTMS is illustrated in Fig. 8(d), (e) and (f). The battery’s Tmax and ΔTmax and α of CPCM on the surface B of the battery significantly decrease to less than 0.87, while the coolant pressure drop inevitably reduces a little. Compared the result solved by NSGA-Ⅱ with that by simulation, the relative errors of Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP, and η are 0.11 %, 2.71 %, 4.47 %, and 1.23 % as shown in Table 4, respectively, validating the solution accuracy of the NSGA-Ⅱ algorithm. Compared with the reference sample, simulated Tmax and ΔTmax based on the optimal parameter combination are decreased by 1.35 % and 12.3 %, and the calculated η increases to 76.01 %, while simulated ΔP only increases by 7.46 Pa with a mass flow rate of 0.75 g/s.

To verify the simulation result, the physical experiments for the CH-HBTMS were conducted with various discharge rates on the experimental platform shown in Fig. 4(b). The temperature profiles of monitoring point P3 obtained from simulation and physical experiments are illustrated in Fig. 15(b). Te is experimental temperature, while Ts denotes simulated temperature. Compared with the experimental results, the maximum deviation of Tmax at 1C rate between Te and Ts is small when compared to the experimental data. By contrast, the maximum deviation of Tmax between Te and Ts at a 3C rate, is greatest among three different discharge rates. The maximum error of the average temperature of P3 at various rates is only 1.74 % as shown in Table 5.

4. Conclusion
A bionic CH-HBTMS inspirited by capillary and honeycomb is proposed to strengthen the cooling performance of the LIB in EVs and its thermal behaviors with different cellular structure and channel configurations are investigated. The multi-objective optimization problem of CH-HBTMS was described based on the objective function of Tmax, ΔTmax, ΔP and η and the optimal solution was calculated by BBD and NSGA-II algorithm. The following are the primary conclusions:
(1)
Compared with circular and square cellular construction of CMTS, the honeycomb can diffuse the heat uniformly and rapidly and controls the cell’s Tmax, ΔTmax and CPCM’s α to 45.16 °C, 1.91 °C and 0.78, respectively, at a discharged rate of 3C with the ambient temperature of 40 °C.
(2)
Multi-branched capillary-shaped channel distributes the cell temperature evenly and improves heat exchange capacity between the CLFC and the battery. Compared with other CLFCs, diagonal inlet/outlet arrangement effectively enhance the system’s heat dissipation, and can keep the cell’s Tmax, and ΔTmax within 46.91 °C and 5.32 °C, respectively, with ΔP only 36.66 Pa at Fin of 0.6 g/s.
(3)
The CH-HBTMS with honeycomb CMTS and LCFC diagonally inlet/outlet arranged have better heat dissipation performance compared to a single CMTS or LCFC. In the system, the maximum temperature rise is 4.48 °C, ΔTmax remains at 3.17 °C, and the average liquid fraction of CPCM is 0.48, with a good auxiliary cooling of CPCM.
(4)
Compare the systems before and after optimization, the temperature rise and temperature difference of the battery in the optimal CH-HBTM decreased by 20.83 % and 10.41 % and the system’s mass grouping rate increased to 76.01 %, while the inlet/outlet pressure drop of the flow channel only increased by 7.46 Pa with a mass flow rate of 0.75 g/s.
The future work of the research would be focused on an experimental investigation to upgrade the heat dissipation of the CH-HBTM through mixing high thermal conductive additives with the PCM used in the study or replacing different CPCM.
