In this paper, the dimensionless analysis method is used to establish a simplified coupled model of the control rod motion and the fluid flow, and a transient response analysis of the control rod drop is conducted. First, through coordinate transformation, the motion equation of the control rod and the Navier-Stokes equation of the fluid flow are established in the relative coordinate system. Second, considering the characteristics that the control rod has a large slenderness ratio and the gap between the control rod and the guide tube is very narrow, the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation is simplified, and the fluid-structure interaction equations are derived. Third, a symplectic algorithm with dual time steps is introduced to improve efficiency. Subsequently, the correctness of the established model and the high efficiency of the symplectic algorithm are validated based on small-scale and full-scale experiments. Finally, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of control rod drop is carried out under normal and extreme ocean conditions, indicating that the dropping of the control rod remains safe under both conditions.

1. Introduction
Floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs), an offshore nuclear technology known for cleanliness, efficiency, and flexibility, have garnered significant attention from governments globally. FNPPs’ benefits, including environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and reduced weather dependence, make them promising candidates for various applications. (Buongiorno et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2024). FNPPs exhibit remarkable advantages in fields such as offshore oil and gas development, island development, power supply, heating, and seawater desalination in remote areas (Han et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023, Xu et al., 2023). However, when a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) occurs, the core temperature rises sharply. At this time, the safety protection system activates, causing the control rod (CR) to drop promptly to halt the nuclear reaction in the shortest time possible. CR drop analysis involves multiple factors such as fluid-structure interaction (Liu et al., 2024), abrupt change of flow field and strong nonlinearity, rendering this analysis a highly challenging and complex topic.
In the past decades, the research of CR drop on land has made great progress in various aspects (Wu et al., 2024). put forward an analysis program for rod dropping in the event of an earthquake. The purpose of this program is to handle the nonlinear problem generated by the contact. By considering the added mass and fluid flow (Liu et al., 2023), proposed a method to calculate the time of an eccentric CR drop. The aim is to investigate how the eccentricity impacts the flow within the guide tube and the drop time. The deterministic and statistical analyses are carried out to analyze the CR drop based on the adaptive symplectic algorithm and the adaptive collocation stochastic method, respectively (Wu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). The interval process model was adopted for the first time to describe the uncertain friction applied on the CR (Yang et al., 2024). Huang et al. (2018) formulated the transverse equation of the CR drawing on the transverse control equation (Païdoussis, 1976). They took into account the impact of earthquakes on the dropping process of the CR. A model was developed for the CR drop in a thorium-based molten salt reactor, and experiments in air and water were used to verify this model (Lin et al. (2017). To validate the drop performance of the CR assembly (CRA) (Son et al., 2019), newly manufactured a full-scale CRA adjusted according to the drop analysis findings. Subsequently, they conducted tests on its drop performance (Rabiee and Atf, 2016). conducted simulations the flow field around the CR. They achieved this by utilizing the Reynolds Navier-Stokes equations and the dynamic mesh method. Addressing the vibration of the overall system, for the problem of modeling flexible slender structures moving within flexible tubes and channels, Bulín et al. (2021) first adopted the combination of the absolute nodal coordinate expression and the finite element method. A significant experimental study was carried out to explore how the positioning of the CR affects the wake dynamics of a natural cylinder (Egitmen et al., 2025).
However, all of the above are analyses of CR drop on land, while there is little research on the analysis of CR drop under ocean conditions. Under ocean conditions, current research only considers the flow analysis of fluids, such as the flow analysis of fluids in helical tubes and spiral tubes (Shen et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025), and the hydraulic characteristics of fluids in reactors under ocean conditions (Ko et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Different from the control rod drop under land conditions, the control rod drop faces more uncertain factors and potential risks under ocean conditions. Severe conditions may induce ship motions such as rolling, tilting, and heaving, resulting in six-degree-of-freedom ship movements. These ship motions subject the control rod to various forces such as centripetal force and Coriolis force. These forces not only directly make the force acting on the control rod complex but also lead to high-frequency contact and collision between the control rod and the guide tube. As a result, the force acting on the control rod changes abruptly frequently, and the motion of the control rod exhibits strong nonlinear characteristics. The motion of the ship also makes the fluid flow more complex. In terms of structure, the structure of the control rod under ocean conditions is generally the same as that under land conditions. The main difference is that the structure of the control rod under ocean conditions is equipped with a spring to accelerate the drop of the control rod. Therefore, the control rod drop under ocean conditions is an extension based on the control rod drop under land conditions, representing a more complex and variable working condition. There are two main challenges: 1) As the carrier of the nuclear reactor, the ship will experience six degrees of freedom motions under ocean conditions (waves, ocean currents, wind), including three translational motions and three rotational motions. In this case, it is very difficult to establish a coupled model of CR movement and fluid flow; 2) due to the extremely small gap between the CR and the guide tube (GT), as well as the contact-collision between them, the transient analysis of CR movement and fluid flow is prone to numerical ill-conditioned problems, and the computational cost of the fluid-structure coupled analysis is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, it is critical to consider the structural characteristics of the CR to establish a simplified coupled model of the CR motion and fluid flow under ocean conditions.
Aiming at the above problems, this paper mainly carries out the following work: 1) By constructing three coordinate systems and establishing the relationships between different coordinate systems, the governing equations for CR movement and fluid flow are derived through theoretical analysis; 2) Combining the structural characteristics of the CR and the GT, adopting the dimensionless analysis method (Liu and Liao, 2025; Ruzicka, 2008; Welty et al., 2014) and ignoring high-order small quantities, a simplified one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow in the relative coordinate system is established. This method can significantly reduce the calculation time of the CR drop; 3) The transverse force on the CR exhibits strong nonlinearity, whereas the axial force shows weaker nonlinearity. A very small-time step for transverse time integration is required to ensure integration convergence, while a relatively larger time step for axial time integration can guarantee it as well. Therefore, this paper introduces a symplectic algorithm with dual time steps for transient analysis to improve computational efficiency. In addition, to verify the correctness of the coupled model and symplectic algorithm established in this paper, small-scale and full-scale experiments are carried out. Finally, transient response analyses of CR drop under normal and extreme ocean conditions are conducted, providing technical support for ensuring the safety of offshore floating nuclear reactors.
The arrangement of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, the coupled equations for the movement of the CR and fluid flow under ocean conditions are established. In Section 3, a symplectic algorithm with dual time steps is developed. In Section 4, the accuracy of the CR drop model presented in this paper is verified through small-scale and full-scale experiments respectively. In Section 5, a transient response analysis of the CR drop is carried out for a certain ship model in two ocean conditions. Some conclusions are drawn in the last section.
2. Coupled model of CR drop and fluid flow under ocean conditions
As the carrier of the floating nuclear power plant, a ship will experience motions in six degrees of freedom under the ocean conditions of wind, waves, and currents, as shown in Fig. 1. This includes translational motions of surging, swaying and heaving along the 
, 
, 
 coordinate axes, and rotational motions of rolling, pitching and yawing.

Fig. 1. Under ocean conditions, the ship experiences translational motions and rotational motions.

In the nuclear reactor, the control rod drive system consists primarily of a control rod drive mechanism (CRDM), guide tubes (GT), absorbing rods (AR) and a driving rod (DR). AR and DR are linked together by a star frame (SF) and the overall motion of AR, DR, and SF is referred to as CR movement. The length of the AR exceeds that of the GT. Additionally, each GT has five drain holes: four are located on the sidewall and one is at the bottom. Each GT also has a buffer section (BF) at its lower end. The detailed structural illustration can be found in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3. Three coordinate systems are constructed for the CR drop and fluid flow under ocean conditions.

The reactor is generally fixed to the internal structure of the ship, and the CR is inside the reactor, so the CR motion and the fluid flow in the reactor are not directly affected by the ocean conditions of wind, waves, and currents, but only by the six-degree-of-freedom motion of the ship. In this section, first, the three-dimensional CR motion equations and three-dimensional fluid flow equations under ocean conditions will be established. Then, the three-dimensional fluid Navier-Stokes equations will be simplified through dimensionless analysis to obtain the one-dimensional fluid Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, the fluid-structure coupled equation system will be established by coupling the CR motion equation and the fluid flow equation.
2.1. Three-dimensional CR motion equation and three-dimensional fluid flow equation
2.1.1. Three-dimensional CR motion equation
The literature (Wu et al., 2024) established the equations for the CR motion when there is no coolant in the GT. Based on this, the equations for the CR motion will be established when there is coolant in the GT in this subsection. Similarly, three coordinate systems are constructed (see Fig. 3). Initially, an absolute coordinate system (denoted as 
) is constructed. Take the drain hole at the bottom of the GT as the origin 
. The direction horizontally to the right and the direction vertically upward passing through point 
 are defined as the 
-axis and 
-axis, respectively, and the direction perpendicular to the 
 plane outward is defined as the 
-axis. The absolute coordinate system is stationary relative to the Earth. Subsequently, a relative coordinate system (denoted as 
) is constructed. The origin 
 coincides with the origin 
. Through point 
, the axis aligned with the GT extending upward defines the 
-axis, while the direction perpendicular to the GT axis extending to the right defines the 
-axis. The direction perpendicular to the 
 plane outward defines the 
-axis. The system 
 is fixed to the GT. Finally, a local coordinate system (denoted as 
) is constructed. A perpendicular line is drawn from the midpoint at the bottom of the CR to the 
-axis, with the intersection point denoted as point 
. Through point 
, the axis aligned with the GT extending upward defines the 
-axis, while the direction perpendicular to the GT axis extending to the right defines the 
-axis. The direction perpendicular to the 
 plane outward defines the 
-axis. The system 
 moves with the CR and GT.
The structure considered in this paper is quite similar to that in the literature (Wu et al., 2024). The difference lies in that there is coolant in the GT in this paper. Moreover, although the GT has a large length-to-diameter ratio, its outer wall is completely surrounded by fuel rods. Multiple positioning grids are installed around the CR, GT, and fuel rod assembly, as illustrated in Fig. 9. This configuration effectively constrains the lateral movement of the GT during the motion of the CR, rendering its deformation negligible. However, when the CR contacts the GT, the GT undergoes minor deformation, with the deformation magnitude significantly smaller than the lateral displacement of the CR. Therefore, to simplify the computational model, based on the coupling equations in Wu's work (Wu et al., 2024), the motion equations of the GT are omitted, while the hydrodynamic forces acting on the CR are added in this paper.
A micro-element interval 
 of the CR is taken, and the linear density of the interval is set to 
. According to Newton's second law, the motion equation of the micro-element CR is as follow

2.1.2. Three-dimensional fluid flow equation
Under ocean conditions, the fluid flow will be affected by the translational and rotational motions of the floating nuclear power plant. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation of the fluid in the absolute coordinate system is written in matrix-vector form (Cengel and Cimbala, 2013), that is

where

 system and that in the 
 system, namely

where 
 and 
 represent the coordinates and velocity of the fluid in the relative coordinate system 
, respectively. Combining Eqs. (6), (7), one can get

Eq. (8) is the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation that describes the conservation of fluid momentum under ocean conditions. In Eq. (8), 
 is the Coriolis acceleration, 
 is the pressure generated by eliminating the forces resulting from three translational motions. The last two terms in Eq. (8) are the forces generated by rotational motion.
In 2.1.1 Three-dimensional CR motion equation, 2.1.2 Three-dimensional fluid flow equation, the three-dimensional CR motion equation and the three-dimensional fluid flow equation expressed in relative coordinate system under ocean conditions are derived, namely Eqs. (4), (8). Theoretically, by discretizing the CR motion equation and the fluid flow equation using the finite element method and finite volume method, and then adopting the fluid-structure interaction solution method, the transient responses of the CR and the fluid can be obtained. However, the gap between the CR and the GT is extremely small, and frequent contact and collisions occur between them during the process of the CR drop. These require the fluid control volume to be small enough to ensure numerical stability. Meanwhile, the size and shape of the fluid control volume change rapidly during the transient analysis. Undoubtedly, the above two factors greatly increase the solution time.
Considering the characteristics of the CR and the GT, such as their large slenderness ratio and the narrow gap between them, based on the three-dimensional fluid Navier-Stokes equations established in subsection 2.1.2, a simplified one-dimensional fluid flow equation will be derived through dimensionless analysis in subsection 2.2. Then, in subsection 2.3, coupled equations for three-dimensional CR motion and one-dimensional fluid flow will be established.
2.2. Dimensionless analysis
The method of dimensionless analysis has been extensively applied to examine the effects of various fluid-related properties, mass and heat transfer, etc. In this subsection, dimensionless analysis is used to simplify the Navier-Stokes equations for three-dimensional fluid flow. The following assumptions are first made based on the structural characteristics of the CR and GT:
1)
Since the CR and the GT have a large slenderness ratio, and their cross-sectional dimensions hardly change (close to a cylinder). Assume that the maximum radius of the cross-section of the CR and the GT is 
, and the maximum axial length is 
, then 
 and 
;
2)
Assume that the structural dimensions of the floating nuclear reactor platform are on the order of hundreds of meters, and the amplitude of the rolling angle is 
.
In the 
 and 
 directions of the relative coordinate system, the fluid velocities 
 and 
 are of the same order of magnitude. The order of magnitude of their maximum velocity is 
, and the order of magnitude of the velocity 
 in the 
 direction is 
, then there is 
. Introduce several dimensionless parameters
(9)
where 
 is the rolling frequency, and 
 are dimensionless parameters. There is
(10)
Therefore, Eq. (8) can be rewritten in dimensionless form as
(11)
where

 and 
. Since the frictional force in the z direction cannot be ignored, then 
. The first-order and second-order small quantities 
, 
, 
, 
 and 
 in Eq. (11) are neglected. Rewriting Eq. (11) into form with dimensions, one can get
(12)
(13)
Equations (12), (13) represent the Navier-Stokes equations derived through dimensionless analysis in the relative system under ocean conditions. It can be seen from Eq. (12) that, according to the structural characteristics of the CR and the GT as well as the ocean conditions, the pressure change on the cross-section of the GT can be neglected. Combined with Eq. (8), the pressure drop in a certain interval 
 can be obtained by integrating Eq. (13), that is

 represents the form drag coefficient of the GT, which is obtained from experiments.

 are different components of the pressure drop, each with a specific physical meaning: 
 is the pressure drop coefficient of inertia generated by the fluid acceleration; 
 is the pressure drop coefficient of the convection; 
 and 
 are the pressure drops generated by the fluid frictional resistance of the GT inner wall and the CR outer wall, respectively; 
 is the pressure drop generated by the change in the GT diameter; 
 is the static pressure drop and the pressure drop generated by the translational motion of the ship; and 
 is the pressure drop generated by the rotational motion of the ship.
The pressure drop equation in Eq. (14) is applied to the structure in Fig. 2. The conditions of fluid field in the GT are divided into two types, as shown in Fig. 4.

where

 can be derived according to Eq. (14).
In summary, in this subsection, the three-dimensional fluid flow momentum equation has been reduced to a one-dimensional momentum equation through dimensionless analysis. Next, the coupled equations for CR motion and fluid flow will be established by coupling the three-dimensional CR motion equation with the one-dimensional fluid flow equation.
2.3. Coupled state equations for the CR motion and fluid flow
In this study, the CR movement in the 
 direction is modeled as single-degree-of-freedom motion as its deformation of axis can be ignored. When the finite element method is employed to discretize Eq. (4), one can get the coupled equations the coupled equations for the axial and transverse motions of the CR as

Substitute Eqs. (15), (16) into the Hamilton state space (Kang and Mengzhao, 1991; Li et al., 2021; Low and Campoamor-Stursberg, 2024), and the coupled state equations for the CR motion and fluid flow can be obtained as follows

3. Symplectic algorithm with dual time steps
There are many methods to perform time integration on Eq. (17). Among them, the symplectic algorithm (Hu et al., 2020; Wu and Zhong, 2017; Xu et al., 2023, Xu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2022) offers high precision and robust stability when addressing dynamical problems. Here the adaptive time-stepping symplectic Euler's midpoint (ATSEM) scheme is chosen to address the nonlinear state equations. In this subsection, this algorithm is briefly introduced by taking the equations of the axial CR motion and fluid flow as the example.

In Fig. 5,

 represents the allowable relative error.
The motion of the CR can be classified into the downward motion along the axis direction of the GT and the vibration within the cross section of the GT. When the CR vibrates in the cross section of the GT, it experiences high-frequency contact and collision with the GT. The forces applied on the CR exhibit strong non-linearity, and its velocity shows non-smoothness. A very small step is necessary to ensure the numerical stability. In contrast, the non-linearity of the CR's axial motion is relatively weak, and a relatively large time step for time integration is enough to guarantee calculation accuracy and stability. Therefore, considering these characteristics, this paper introduces a symplectic algorithm with dual time steps (SADTS). Specifically, a larger time step is adopted for the axial downward motion of the CR, while a smaller time step is employed for its transverse vibration.
The symplectic Euler's midpoint (SEM) method (without adaptive time step) is utilized for integrating the axial motion of the CR. Assuming that the starting step for integrating the axial motion of the CR is 
, the steps of the algorithm with dual time steps are as follows:
1)
Given the axial and transverse states of the CR at time 
, the transverse state of the CR within the interval 
 and the axial state of the CR at time 
 are to be determined, as shown in Fig. 6. The time integration of the CR's transverse motion is carried out through the ATSEM, with time steps of 
. The process of the time integration of the CR's transverse motion stops when

2)
The time integration of the CR's axial motion is conducted through the SEM method, with time step of 
.
Due to the frequent contact and collision between the CR and the GT, contact friction will occur between them. This contact friction affects the falling process of the CR. In this subsection, a weighted method is adopted to calculate the contact friction, that is 
, where 
 represents the contact friction between the CR and the GT during the i-th transverse time integration.
Therefore, the transverse state of the CR within the interval 
 and the axial state of the CR at time 
 are obtained. Follow the same steps to conduct the analysis in the second interval 
, and so on.
4. Model and algorithm validation
In this subsection, the model and algorithm for the CR motion and fluid flow under ocean conditions established in this paper are verified through small-scale experiments and full-scale experiments.
4.1. Small-scale experiments
To confirm the accuracy of the model and the algorithm with dual time steps proposed in this paper, a device for a rod falling inside a water-filled circular tube is set up in this subsection, as shown in Fig. 7 (a). During the falling of the rod, the circular tube undergoes a rolling motion. The outer wall of the circular tube is fixed by a rigid structure, and the bottom of the circular tube is blocked.

The settings of parameters are presented below. The diameters of the rod and the tube are 0.01 m and 0.0121 m, respectively, the lengths of the rod and the tube are 1 m and 1.5 m, respectively, the absolute roughness, elastic modulus, and density of the material are 
 m, 
 Pa and 
, respectively, and the density and dynamic viscosity of water are 103 kg/m3 and 0.00089 Pa s respectively.
The time steps of time integration for the transverse and axial movements of the rod are 
 and 
 respectively. The rod is discretized by using beam elements, and the number of elements is 20. The number 
 of iteration steps and allowable relative error 
 are 3 and 10−4, respectively.
To measure the CR displacement, two fluorescent reference marks (A and B) were made on the GT's outer wall, marking the CR's initial and final positions along its travel path. An additional mark (C) was made on the bottom of the CR. During the process of the CR drop, a high-speed camera capable of 790 frames per second was employed to capture the movement of fluorescent markers A, B, and C. The displacement of the CR was then determined by measuring the actual length of AB, denoted as 
 and the measured lengths of AB and AC in the captured images, denoted as 
 and 
, using the formula 
, where 
 represents the CR displacement.
Simulation parameters such as the friction coefficient and contact stiffness between the rod and the circular tube are affected by various factors and need to be estimated inversely according to the experimental data. The friction coefficient and contact stiffness are determined through the fitting method. For the acrylic material employed in this study, these parameters typically fall within the ranges of [0.2, 0.5] and [104, 106] N/m, respectively. The fitted parameter ranges are discretized, with the contact stiffness divided into 5 discrete values (104, 5 × 104, 105, 5 × 105, 106) and the friction coefficient sampled with 8 values from 0.2 to 0.5 at 0.05 intervals. The fitted parameter values are identified by comparing numerical simulation results with experimental measurements from small-scale experiment Condition 1. The numerical results exhibit negligible variation when the contact stiffness is within [5 × 104, 5 × 105] N/m, leading to the selection of a representative value 105 N/m for subsequent analyses. The relative error between simulations and experiments progressively increases from 2.14 % to 5.36 % as the friction coefficient varies across [0.2, 0.5]. Consequently, the friction coefficient is selected as 0.2 for all small-scale experiments. The estimation results of the friction coefficient and contact stiffness are applied to Condition 2 and Condition 3. The relative error is calculated as follow
(21)
where 
 and 
 are the vectors of the rod axial displacement through experiment and numerical method proposed in this paper. It should be noted that these parameters possess specific applicability ranges. For instance, the contact stiffness and friction coefficient obtained from Condition 1 of the small-scale experiments are applicable to experiments with identical rod structural dimensions and material parameters as those in Condition 1. This includes rod drop under various conditions (e.g., tilting, rolling, and heaving motions). However, if an experiment involves different structural dimensions or material parameters from those in Condition 1, the contact stiffness and friction coefficient must be recalculated.
To validate the computational efficiency advantage of the proposed symplectic algorithm with dual time steps (SADTS), the symplectic algorithm with the single time step (SASTS) is employed as a benchmark for comparison (Wu et al., 2024). For the SASTS, the time step of time integration for the movement of the rod is 10−4 s, and other parameters are the same as those of the SADTS. The curves of the rod's axial displacement under three conditions are shown in Fig. 8.

The results presented in Fig. 8 reveal that when the initial inclination of the circular tube is 10°, the results obtained by using the SASTS and the SADTS are in good agreement with the experimental results. When the contact stiffness and contact friction coefficient inversely estimated through Condition 1 are applied to Condition 2 and Condition 3, the results of the two algorithms also show a relatively good degree of agreement with the experimental results. The relative errors between the results obtained by the two algorithms and the experimental results, as well as the CPU times when the two algorithms are used for calculation under the three conditions are shown in Table 2.

Condition	Relative error	CPU time (s)
SASTS	SADTS	SASTS	SADTS
1	2.13 %	2.14 %	80.15	49.27
2	2.83 %	2.64 %	78.33	41.95
3	3.01 %	3.02 %	79.22	50.87
It can be seen from Table 2 that the results obtained by SASTS and SADTS are very close. The CPU time used in the calculation by SADTS is less than that by SASTS.
Three small-scale experiments verify the correctness of the models and the high efficiency of the SADTS for the rod motion and fluid flow established in this paper under rolling conditions. Subsequently, subsection 4.2 further validates the model and algorithm proposed in this paper through full-scale experiments.
4.2. Full-scale experiments
In this subsection, three full-scale experiments of the CR drop are carried out. Fig. 9 depicts the overall design of the fuel assembly.
The length, density, diameter and elastic modulus of the CR are 2.5 m, 7650 kg/m3, 
 and 
 respectively. The length of the GT, the diameter of its upper part and the diameter of its lower buffer section are 2.4 m, 0.01145 m and 0.01009 m respectively. The reactor temperature and pressure are 40 °C and 0.32 MPa, respectively, while the acceleration spring exhibited a preload force of 1872.64 N with a stiffness of 123,200 N/m, and the control rod had a total mass of 81 kg occupying a volume of 0.0011 m3. The time steps of time integration for the transverse and axial movements of the CR are 10−5 s and 10−4 s respectively. The number 
 of iteration steps and allowable relative error 
 are 3 and 10−4, respectively.
In this subsection, three inclining experiments (denoted as Condition 1, Condition 2 and Condition 3) of CR drop are carried out, with the inclination angles being 5°, 15° and 25°, respectively. In the full-scale experiment, the friction coefficient and contact stiffness are different from those coefficients in the small-scale experiment. Similarly, through the fitting method based on Condition 1 of the full-scale experiments, we determine the contact stiffness and friction coefficient, which are subsequently applied to Conditions 2 and 3 of the full-scale experiments. The friction coefficient and contact stiffness are obtained to be 0.35 and 106 N/m, respectively.
Similarly, the SASTS is employed as a benchmark to validate the computational efficiency advantage of the SADTS. For the SASTS, the time step of time integration for the movement of the control rod is 10−5 s, and other parameters are the same as those of the SADTS. The curves of the CR's axial displacement, velocity and acceleration under three conditions are shown in Fig. 10.

The results presented in Fig. 10 reveal that the results obtained by using the SASTS and the SADTS are in good agreement with the experimental results. The relative errors between the results obtained by the two algorithms and the experimental results, as well as the CPU times when the two algorithms are used for calculation under the three conditions are shown in Table 3.
Table 3. For the three full-scale experiments, the relative errors between the results obtained by the two algorithms (SASTS and the SADTS) and the experimental results, as well as the CPU times when the two algorithms are used for calculation.

Condition	Relative error	CPU time (s)
Single time step	Dual time step	Single time step	Dual time step
1	2.74 %	2.79 %	1305.23	758.11
2	1.90 %	1.90 %	1401.29	884.72
3	1.67 %	1.66 %	1545.38	1092.79
It can be seen from Table 3 that the results obtained by using SASTS and SADTS are very close. The CPU time used in the calculation by SADTS is less than that by SASTS.
During the fall of the CR, there are three key parameters that are of great concern in engineering, namely, the time T5 and velocity V5 when the CR reaches the buffer section of the GT, and the time T5 + T6 when the CR reaches the bottom of the GT. The three key parameters obtained by using SASTS and SADTS are compared with the experimental results, as shown in Table 4.

Condition	1	2	3
Parameter	T5	V5	T5 + T6	T5	V5	T5 + T6	T5	V5	T5 + T6

Single time step	0.728 (2.51 %)	3.02 (2.05 %)	1.22 (0.877 %)	0.760 (0.619 %)	2.88 (4.10 %)	1.27 (2.02 %)	0.809 (1.09 %)	2.67 (4.98 %)	1.36 (4.43 %)
Dual time step	0.789 (2.57 %)	3.01 (1.56 %)	1.22 (0.933 %)	0.760 (0.606 %)	2.87 (3.77 %)	1.27 (2.08 %)	0.810 (1.03 %)	2.68 (5.12 %)	1.36 (4.58 %)
As can be seen from the results in Table 4, the results obtained by using SASTS and SADTS are very close. The relative errors between the results obtained by the SADTS and the experimental results are small, with the maximum relative error being 5.12 %. The maximum relative error between the results obtained by the SASTS and the experimental results is 4.98 %.
Through the above six examples, the results obtained by the SADTS demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental data, exhibiting nearly identical accuracy to those computed using the SASTS. Furthermore, the SADTS achieves significantly higher computational efficiency, with a speedup factor ranging from 1.41 to 1.87, indicating substantial performance improvement. These findings robustly validate the reliability of the symplectic algorithm with dual time steps. Therefore, the full-scale experiments further confirm the correctness of the model and the high efficiency of the SADTS established in this paper.
5. Analysis of CR drop under different ocean conditions
As the carrier of a floating nuclear reactor, the ship may encounter various ocean conditions during its voyage in the ocean. In this section, firstly, the wind, waves, and currents under different ocean conditions are applied as loads to a certain ship, as shown in Fig. 11. This study assumes that the control rod assembly is rigidly fixed to the ship, with the drain hole at the bottom of the GT coinciding with the ship's center of mass. Therefore, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the drain hole are identical to those of the ship's center of mass. Furthermore, the angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration of the control rod assembly are equal to those of the ship when it rotates around the absolute coordinate axes.

In addition, the windward/flow area and shape coefficients of the ship in the X and Y directions with respect to wind and current are shown in Table 6.

The boundary element method is adopted to discretize the hull surface into a series of panel elements, with 4050 nodes and 4048 elements. Using the three-dimensional potential flow radiation-diffraction theory, the ship's dynamic responses are analyzed and obtained. In 5.1 Normal ocean conditions, 5.2 Extreme ocean conditions, the responses of the ship and CR drop will be analyzed under normal and extreme ocean conditions, respectively.
5.1. Normal ocean conditions
The spectral method is utilized to describe ocean wind and wave. As for normal ocean conditions (Faltinsen, 1993), it is assumed that the wind direction is perpendicular to the vessel's longitudinal axis (i.e., the ship length direction) and remains constant during the analysis period, with the NPD wind spectrum applied. The wave direction is assumed to be aligned with the wind direction. Numerous models of the wave spectrum capture the intricacies of real-world wave spectra (Adibzade et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2023; Hasselmann et al., 1973a, 1973b; Li et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). In the subsection, the Jonswap spectrum is employed. The amplitudes and governing equations of wind and waves are implicitly embedded in the spectral density functions of the respective spectra. The spectral density functions for the NPD wind spectrum and JONSWAP wave spectrum (Hasselmann et al., 1973a, 1973b) are as follow
(22)
where f is frequency, U is the wind speed at 10 m height (20 m/s), and the empirical coefficients a, b, and n are 0.003, 0.12, and 0.468, respectively. γ is the peak spectral factor, while α can be derived from the significant wave height Hs (1.88 m), peak spectral period Tp (8.8 s), and γ using empirical formulations (Hasselmann et al., 1973a, 1973b), g denotes gravitational acceleration, ω is the angular frequency, ωp is the peak angular frequency (ωp = 2π/Tp), and σ is the spectral width parameter. Additionally, the surface current velocity is 0.8 m/s, with the ocean current direction aligned with the wind direction.
Through dynamic analysis, the curves of the ship's displacement, velocity, acceleration in three directions, as well as rotational angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration within 300 s are shown in Fig. 12.

Under normal ocean conditions, the ship motion varies within the time interval [0 s, 300 s], and the CR may begin to drop at any moment during this interval. Although it is impractical to enumerate all possible drop moments to obtain every corresponding response, a sufficient number of drop response results can be acquired by conducting a finite series of drops at a relatively small time interval across the entire duration. In this paper, the CR drop operation was performed at 1-s intervals, yielding a total of 298 sets of drop data within the [0 s, 300 s] range. Among these, the conditions corresponding to the maximum and minimum total drop times (T5+T6) are designated as Condition 1 and Condition 2, respectively. The curves of displacement, velocity and acceleration are shown in Fig. 13.

In addition, the key parameters T5, V5 and T5 + T6 regarding the process of the CR are shown in Table 7.
Table 7. The key parameters T5, V5 and T5 + T6 regarding the process of the CR under Condition 1 and Condition 2.

Condition	T5 (s)	V5 (m/s)	T5+T6 (s)
1	1.2084	1.902	1.7386
2	1.3176	1.694	1.9046
The results presented in Table 7 reveal that the time for the CR to reach the buffer section is less than 1.32 s, the speed is less than 2 m/s, and the overall dropping time is less than 2 s. Assuming that the system safety allowable time for this reactor is 3 s, from a safety perspective, under this normal ocean condition, both the dropping time and speed of the CR are within the safe range.
5.2. Extreme ocean conditions
In order to further study the safety of the CR drop, this subsection places the floating nuclear reactor in extreme ocean conditions (Faltinsen, 1993). The wind, wave and current of ocean conditions are defined as follows: the average wind speed is 65 m/s, following the NPD wind spectrum; the fluid surface flow velocity is 4 m/s; the wave adopts the Jonswap spectrum, with a significant wave height of 20 m, a peak spectral period of 20 s (0.3142 rad/s), and a peak spectral factor of 1. Similarly, the directions of the wind, wave, and current are all along the positive y-axis. The curves of the ship's displacement, velocity, acceleration in three directions, as well as rotational angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration within 200 s are shown in Fig. 14.

Similarly, The CR is dropped every 1 s. A total of 198 results for the CR drop are obtained within the interval 
. The conditions with the maximum and minimum overall falling times (i.e., T5 + T6) are set as Condition 1 and Condition 2. The curves of displacement, velocity and acceleration are shown in Fig. 15.

In addition, the key parameters T5, V5 and T5 + T6 regarding the process of the CR are shown in Table 8.
Table 8. The key parameters T5, V5 and T5 + T6 regarding the process of the CR under Condition 1 and Condition 2.

Condition	T5 (s)	V5 (m/s)	T5+T6 (s)
1	1.0666	2.204	1.5336
2	1.6658	1.369	2.3128
The results presented in Table 8 reveal that the time for the CR to reach the buffer section is less than 1.7 s, the speed is less than 2.3 m/s, and the overall dropping time is less than 2.4 s. The maximum value of T5 + T6 in this subsection is 21.43 % larger than that in subsection 5.1, and the minimum value of T5 + T6 in this subsection is 13.37 % less than that in subsection 5.1. Therefore, the results under extreme ocean conditions are relatively safer or more dangerous, that is, a larger time interval of T5 + T6. Similarly, if the system safety allowable time for this reactor is 3 s, then both the dropping time and speed of the CR are still within the safe range under such extreme ocean conditions.
In summary, under both normal and extreme ocean conditions, the results of the CR drop meet the assumed safety criteria. However, the results of the CR drop are not only related to the ocean conditions but also significantly associated with the structural size and material properties of the ship. For a specific ship, engineers can conduct a detailed analysis of the CR drop by using the method proposed in this paper.
6. Conclusions
This paper conducts an analysis of the control rod drop in an offshore floating nuclear power plant under different ocean conditions of wind, waves and currents. Firstly, combining the structural characteristics of the control rod and the guide tube, a simplified dynamic coupling model of the control rod movement and fluid flow under ocean conditions is constructed through dimensionless analysis. Then, in order to perform time integration efficiently and accurately, a symplectic algorithm with dual time steps (SADTS) is proposed. Subsequently, the accuracy of the model and algorithm developed in the paper is verified through small-scale experiments and full-scale experiments. Finally, the safety of the control rod is analyzed under different ocean conditions. Some conclusions are drawn:
1)
In the small-scale experiments, three sets of rolling experiments with different angles and insertion depths were carried out in subsection 4.1. In the comparison between the results of the model proposed in this paper and the experimental results, the maximum relative error is 3.02 %, which verifies the correctness of the model and algorithm established in this paper. Compared with the symplectic algorithm with the single time step (SASTS), SADTS demonstrates a minimum 1.5-fold increase in computational speed, indicating a significant enhancement in computational efficiency.
2)
In the full-scale experiments, three sets of control rod drop experiments were carried out in subsection 4.2. The maximum relative error between the results of the model and the experimental results is 2.79 %, and the maximum relative error of the key parameters T5, V5 and T5 + T6 is 5.12 %, which further proves the correctness of the model proposed herein. Compared with the SASTS, the calculation speed of SADTS has been increased by at least 1.4 times, which once again demonstrates that the computational efficiency has been significantly improved;
3)
In the analysis of control rod drop under normal and extreme ocean conditions, this paper takes a certain ship as the carrier to analyze the response of the control rod. By dropping the control rod every 1 s, 197 results of the control rod drop are obtained. From these results, the maximum and minimum dropping times are derived, and this range represents the range of the control rod drop under different ocean conditions. Under normal and extreme ocean conditions, the time intervals of the control rod drop are 
 and 
 respectively. These results are all less than the system safety time (3 s), indicating that the control rod drop is safe under the ocean conditions and ship model considered in this paper.
In conclusion, the control rod drop model for floating nuclear reactors established in this paper reduces the model complexity and improves computational efficiency. Meanwhile, through the study of normal and extreme conditions, a comprehensive and systematic research on the safety of control rod drop has been carried out, which provides technical support for control rod analysis.
It should be noted that the control rod and the guide tube undergo thermal expansion due to exposure to high temperature, high pressure, and radiation within the nuclear reactor. This thermal expansion consequently affects their geometric dimensions. Furthermore, external conditions such as temperature and coolant flow rate in the reactor may also exhibit certain variations. Therefore, the results obtained in this paper were derived under relatively ideal conditions, which imposes certain limitations. When multiple parameters are subject to uncertainties, how to obtain statistically characteristic control rod drop response to ensure the safety of nuclear reactors becomes the main issue for subsequent research.
