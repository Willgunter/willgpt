Abstract
Rogue waves can drive significant volumes of water onto a ship's deck through both the bow and the sides, giving rise to green water phenomena that pose serious threats to navigational safety. While most previous studies have concentrated on rigid ship structures, limited attention has been paid to hydroelastic effects. In this study, a two-way coupled CFD-FEM approach is employed to comparatively analyze the slamming responses of two types of KCS ship models: rigid and flexible. The numerical approach is validated against theoretical predictions and a dam-break experiment. The numerical results agree with the experimental data within a 5 % error. Slamming-prone regions, including the bow, deck, and superstructure, are systematically analyzed. The results indicate that pressure peaks progressively decrease from the ship bottom to the bow, midship section, and deck, while measurement points near the deck and superstructure, especially those farther from the midship section, are most sensitive to hydroelastic effects. Flexible ships exhibit similar pressure distributions; however, hydroelasticity enhances energy dissipation during impacts. As a result, the peak impact pressure is most significantly reduced in the superstructure due to hydroelastic effects, with reductions ranging from 27.59 % to 61.36 %. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating hydroelasticity in ship slamming analyses and provide a practical reference for structural design and safety assessment of large container ships in extreme seas.

1. Introduction
Rogue waves are extreme, highly nonlinear wave events. They can generate green water on deck and exert substantial impact forces, thereby threatening navigational safety (Garett and Gemmrich, 2009; Gao et al., 2020). Most existing studies have primarily examined the slamming response of rigid ships. However, in practice, ship structures are never perfectly rigid. External loads inevitably induce deformations, which in turn modify the surrounding flow field and influence the slamming response. Therefore, investigating flexible ships with hydroelastic effects is essential for advancing ship design and ensuring reliable safety assessments under extreme sea conditions.
The slamming loads and structural responses of ships in extreme sea states have long been central issues in ocean engineering. Early experimental investigations demonstrated that the bow flare substantially increases the nonlinearity of wave loads. They also showed that structural elasticity could further amplify this effect (Fonseca and Soares, 2004). Subsequently, hydroelasticity theory was gradually incorporated into ship load prediction. For instance, Paik et al. (2009) compared one-way and two-way coupling methods and demonstrated that the two-way approach produced results more consistent with experimental observations. Hirdaris and Temarel (2009) reviewed the transition from potential flow theory to CFD-FEM coupling methods and emphasized the advantages of two-way fluid-structure interaction for strongly nonlinear hydroelastic problems. Besnier (2000) summarized early insights into the numerical simulation of ship structures with fluid-structure interaction, emphasizing the need for more reliable tools to simulate complex dynamic behavior in large, high-speed ships. Sepehrirahnama et al. (2019) explored ship-ship collision problems using ALE-based FSI simulations, focusing on contact forces and motion predictions. Song et al. (2017) experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic forces on vertical cylinders subjected to plunging solitary waves, offering insights into dynamic amplification mechanisms. More recently, Zhou et al. (2023) presented a STAR-CCM+-ABAQUS co-simulation framework for analyzing the progressive collapse of container ships under varying wave conditions, demonstrating the practicality of FSI-based nonlinear analysis for structural safety evaluation.
Subsequently, Luo et al. (2012) analyzed the water entry of three-dimensional wedge structures using Wagner theory combined with the finite element method. They highlighted the importance of structural flexibility. Similar nonlinear localized hydrodynamic interactions have also been reported in transient gap resonance excited by focused wave groups (Gao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022; Mi et al. 2025a, 2025b). Recent studies showed that structural motion and ambient currents can significantly affect gap resonance characteristics, including resonant period, wave amplification, and hydrodynamic loads (Gao et al. 2022, 2023, 2026). However, such uncoupled methods could not capture the full fluid-structure interaction. To address this limitation, Dhavalikar et al. (2015) applied a one-way coupling method to study whipping responses, but this method generally overestimated the response. El Moctar et al. (2017) employed the RANS equations to couple ship motions. They successfully simulated the whipping response of a containership in both regular and irregular waves, thereby verifying the feasibility of CFD-based approaches. Hu et al. (2017) further compared slamming induced by rogue waves and regular waves. They found that rogue waves generated more irregular green water on deck and exhibited stronger added-mass effects. Qin et al. (2017) investigated green water slamming on decks induced by nonlinear rogue waves. They showed that such waves can cause severe impacts on offshore structures, with hydroelastic effects that cannot be neglected. Takami et al. (2018) developed a two-way CFD-FEM coupling method and validated its accuracy against model tests in terms of global motions, slamming pressures, and whipping responses. Qin et al. (2017) and Mai et al. (2020) demonstrated through numerical and experimental studies that hydroelastic effects must not be ignored in rogue wave impacts and local water-entry problems. Lakshmynarayanana and Hirdaris (2020) further confirmed the reliability of an implicit two-way coupling method in predicting nonlinear fluid-structure interaction responses.
In recent years, three-dimensional nonlinear time-domain approaches have advanced rapidly. Chen et al. (2019a) proposed a nonlinear time-domain hydroelastic method based on the Rankine source panel approach for high-speed vessels and containerships. They validated it against segmented model tests. Jiao et al. (2019) investigated short-term wave load prediction and whipping characteristics under realistic sea states. Later, Chen et al. (2019b) proposed a three-dimensional nonlinear time-domain hydroelastic method for high-speed trimarans in oblique waves. They verified its reliability and accuracy for analyzing nonlinear hydroelastic responses in oblique irregular waves. Huang et al. (2022) conducted an uncertainty analysis of the CFD-FEA approach and confirmed its predictive accuracy. Liu et al. (2022) applied a CFD-FEM solver to flexible offshore structures and demonstrated good adaptability. Jiao et al. (2021) further achieved two-way coupling between STAR-CCM+ and ABAQUS. This enabled simultaneous prediction of ship motions, accelerations, wave loads, and whipping effects for large-scale vessels. Chen et al. (2023) studied the slamming of wedge-type gratings freely falling into nonlinear waves. They found that flexibility significantly influences local load distribution. Yan et al. (2023) also showed that rigid and flexible wedges and plates yield different pressure distributions during small-angle impacts. They noted that assuming rigidity may underestimate local effects. More recently, Chen et al. (2024a) and Li et al. (2024) reviewed the advantages of two-way coupling for ship load analysis, particularly when large deformations are involved. Xie et al. (2024) and Jiao et al. (2025) validated the consistency between numerical simulations and experimental results using two-way coupling approaches. Tai et al. (2024) proposed an enhanced slamming model for vertical cylinders by incorporating realistic wave boundaries and finite-volume effects, improving the accuracy of wave force predictions under extreme wave conditions. Ma et al. (2020) experimentally studied plunging solitary wave impacts on slender cylinders, highlighting how wave phase and structural compliance influence hydrodynamic loads and dynamic amplification.
The latest studies have extended the scope to larger-scale models and more complex conditions. Chen et al. (2024b) compared global motions and slamming responses of ship models at different scales. They revealed significant scale effects. Another study examined asymmetric wave loads together with hydroelastic responses in oblique waves. Zhang et al. (2025) conducted a two-way coupling analysis of a 20,000 TEU ultra-large containership and confirmed that structural flexibility must be incorporated into the design process. However, most existing hydroelastic studies either idealize the ship as a simplified beam or hull-girder model, or focus mainly on global responses such as overall bending moments and motions, so the influence of hydroelastic effects on local slamming loads in different structural regions under extreme waves remains insufficiently understood. In this study, the flexible KCS container ship is modeled as a three-dimensional shell structure within a fully coupled CFD-FEM framework, and local hull-surface deformation is explicitly considered. Pressure sensors are arranged in three key regions, namely the bow, deck, and superstructure, and parallel simulations of rigid and flexible ships under identical rogue-wave focusing conditions are performed. In this way, the present work systematically compares slamming responses in these regions and quantitatively clarifies how hydroelasticity reduces local peak impact pressures with clear regional differences.
In this study, numerical simulations are conducted to comparatively analyze the slamming responses of a rigid and a flexible ship subjected to green water on deck induced by rogue waves. First, a three-dimensional numerical wave tank is established, and three rogue waves with different focused amplitudes are simulated after verifying wave convergence. Then, the numerical method is validated by comparing the simulation results with data from a classical dam-break experiment. Finally, pressure measurements at the bow, deck, and superstructure regions are analyzed to reveal the general influence of hydroelastic effects on slamming loads. Moreover, the variations of slamming pressure at different measurement points within the same region are examined to identify the pressure evolution trends.
2. Rogue wave representation and fluid-structure interaction
2.1. Numerical representation of rogue waves
Rogue waves can be simulated using either linear or nonlinear numerical approaches. Nonlinear approaches demand greater computational effort and higher parameter accuracy. They are also sensitive to small changes in initial conditions, often leading to significant result fluctuations. In contrast, linear approaches are computationally efficient. They provide better control of wave characteristics and enable the generation of focused waves at specific locations with reduced sensitivity to perturbations. Therefore, this study adopts the linear superposition approach to simulate rogue waves. The method is based on the principle of linear superposition and dispersion theory to model rogue waves (Liu, 2018).
According to this principle, the surface elevation at any given position can be expressed as:
(1)
where Mf and Mθ are the number of composition waves and the number of directions, respectively; fi is the frequency; aij is the component wave amplitude corresponding to the frequency fij; ki is the wave number; θj is the direction angle; 
i is the angular frequency; and φij is the initial phase of the component wave. Since this study focuses on unidirectional rogue waves propagating in following seas, the effect of the focusing direction is not considered, Mθ = 1, θ = 0. Therefore, equation (1) can be written as:
(2)
The component wave frequency fi and wave number ki satisfy the linear dispersion relation:
(3)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity; h is the water depth under the corresponding working conditions. Assuming that component waves are superimposed at x = xc (the focusing position) when t = tc (the focusing time), the focused wave elevation can be expressed as:
(4)
Therefore, the initial phase of the component wave can be expressed as:
(5)
By substituting equation (5) into equation (2), the wave surface equation of the rogue waves can be written as:
(6)
The amplitude ai is determined by the wave spectrum adopted for rogue wave simulation. Commonly used spectra include the Constant Wave Steepness (CWS) distribution, the Constant Spectral Amplitude (CSA) distribution, and the JONSWAP spectrum. In this study, the CWS spectrum is employed because it produces pronounced wave peaks and concentrated energy, enabling controlled wave generation at specific locations and yielding stable numerical results.
The spectrum of the Constant Wave Steepness distribution (CWS) can be expressed as:
(7)
where ai is the amplitude of the component wave; Sa(fi) is the amplitude spectrum at frequency fi, and A is the target wave amplitude at the focusing point.
2.2. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach
Different types of coupling exist between fluid and structural domains. Such problems are generally classified as fluid-structure interactions (FSI). In other words, they involve the mutual interaction between hydrodynamic and structural responses. This interaction may be one-way or two-way, corresponding to one-way and two-way coupling, respectively.
In one-way coupling, structural deformation is not fed back into the CFD solver, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (left). As a result, mesh deformation does not occur. One-way coupling neglects the added mass effect arising from elastic deformation of flexible ships. Therefore, one-way coupling is mainly used for weakly coupled problems in which structural deformation has minimal influence on the flow field. Nevertheless, significant structural deformations can markedly affect the flow field and should not be neglected. In this situation, the complete system of equations for both fluid and structure must be solved simultaneously. This approach is referred to as two-way coupling, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (right). In two-way coupling, structure deformation is fed back into the fluid solver to redefine the mesh of both the solid and fluid domains. This allows a full structural analysis and updates the boundary conditions and fluid domain at each time step. In this study, the ship undergoes significant motions and slamming effects under rogue waves, which result in strong fluid-structure interaction. Therefore, to accurately capture the influence of ship deformation on slamming responses under rogue wave conditions, this study employs a two-way coupling approach in the numerical simulations.

Fig. 1. Flowcharts of one-way coupling (left) and two-way coupling (right).

In the present CFD simulations, the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations are solved in STAR-CCM+ using the finite-volume method. A segregated solver is adopted to compute the velocity and pressure fields. Turbulence is modeled using the realizable k-ε two-equation model, together with a two-layer all y+ wall treatment for near-wall flows. The convective terms are discretized with a second-order upwind scheme, while temporal integration is performed using a second-order implicit scheme. Pressure–velocity coupling is handled using the SIMPLE algorithm. The air–water interface is captured by the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, and the volume-fraction transport equation is discretized using the high-resolution interface-capturing (HRIC) scheme to minimize numerical diffusion and maintain a sharp free surface.
In STAR-CCM+, fluid loads are transferred to the FEM solver at specified exchange intervals. These loads include hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures as well as associated inertial forces. The FEM solver calculates the structural response to these loads. It then returns the nodal displacements and deformations to STAR-CCM+ at the same exchange intervals. In this study, data are exchanged between the fluid and structural solvers every 0.0015 s. The structural solver is configured to perform bidirectional data exchange, while the fluid solver is set to “co-simulation partner with two-way mapping,” ensuring consistent and synchronized FSI interaction. STAR-CCM+ then updates mesh deformation and motion based on the received displacement data. After completing the data-exchange iterations within a given time step, the process advances to the next time step and repeats until the maximum specified simulation time is reached. The “Dynamic Implicit” analysis step is selected, with an initial time increment of 1 × 10−4 s, a minimum of 1 × 10−6 s, and a maximum of 1 × 108 s increments. A smaller initial increment facilitates displacement convergence in ABAQUS during the early stages of the coupling calculation. It also improves the overall convergence of the coupled simulation. Once ABAQUS achieves convergence over several successive analysis steps, the increment size increases automatically to accelerate subsequent computations.
3. Numerical model validation
To ensure reliable predictions, validation studies were conducted prior to the main simulations. The computations were performed on a workstation with double Intel Xeon Gold 5218R CPUs, 128 GB RAM, and 20 cores. This section is divided into two parts. The first part evaluates the convergence of grid resolution and time step size. The second part validates the model against dam-break experiments to confirm its capability in capturing slamming pressures.
3.1. Grid and time step convergence
Although smaller grid sizes and time steps improve simulation accuracy, they also substantially increase computational costs. Therefore, to balance accuracy and efficiency, this study first conducts grid and time step convergence verification using regular waves with significant wave height H = 0.289 m (amplitude A = H/2), wave period T = 2.120 s, and wavelength λ = 7.125 m. The water depth in the numerical wave tank is set to h = 5.4 m.
The numerical wave tank length is set to ten times the incident wavelength. The left boundary is defined as a wave generation boundary, and the right boundary as a velocity outlet. As shown in Fig. 2, the wave tank is divided into a propagation region and a damping region. The damping region length is set to twice the incident wavelength. Five wave probes (P1–P5) are placed within the numerical tank at distances of 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 times the incident wavelength from the wave-generation boundary. To generate stable numerical waves without significant attenuation, five grid resolutions in the vertical (wave height) direction are tested: 0.029, 0.019, 0.014, 0.010, and 0.007 m, corresponding to 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 cells per wave height, respectively. The relative error of the simulated wave height is evaluated at probe P3, which is located in the central part of the propagation region where the regular wave is fully developed and still sufficiently far from the damping zone. The error data for each grid size are shown in Fig. 3(a). Results indicate that when the grid resolution reaches A/20, simulation error decreases significantly to 0.96 % relative to the theoretical value. Further refinement yields only marginal improvement. Considering computational efficiency, this study adopts A/20 as the baseline grid resolution for wave simulation. Similarly, the time step has a significant impact on both accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, a time-step convergence analysis is conducted using T/300, T/500, T/800, T/1000, and T/1200. The corresponding error data are presented in Fig. 3(b). Results show that when the time step reaches T/800, the simulation error is substantially reduced to 0.65 % relative to the theoretical value. Thus, considering both accuracy and efficiency, T/800 is selected as the time step for wave simulation in this study. To prevent numerical divergence caused by the sharp transition between fine mesh in the free-surface region and coarser mesh in the background domain, a transition region is introduced between these zones. This region has a height of 2.4 times the focused wave amplitude along the z-axis, and its mesh size is twice of the free-surface region. This transition smooths the mesh connection and improves grid quality, as shown in Fig. 4.

Based on the optimal grid size and time step determined through convergence verification, three sets of rogue waves with varying focused wave amplitudes were simulated in the numerical tank. The study included three different focusing amplitudes: 0.145 m (Case I), 0.168 m (Case II) and 0.192 m (Case III), corresponding to 1.5 times, 1.75 times and 2 times freeboard height. As shown in Table 1. The maximum wave steepness Akp (where kp is the wave number of peak frequency) is 0.18, which remains below the critical breaking steepness (Hu et al., 2017). When the largest wave focuses at the expected position, the wave profiles on both sides of the rogue wave are nearly symmetric, as shown in Fig. 5. Error analysis indicates that the discrepancy between the numerical and theoretical solutions is less than 1 %. The time and location of the maximum wave deviate from the expected focus by less than 1 %. Therefore, the grid resolution and time step adopted in this study are suitable for rogue wave simulations, and the results demonstrate high accuracy.

3.2. Validation and analysis of dam-break problems
The dam-break-type green water impact is a common form of deck overtopping. It can effectively estimate the impact pressure exerted on the deck and superstructures. Therefore, this study adopts the dam-break physical experiment conducted by Lobovsky et al. (2014) as a reference and employs numerical simulations to reproduce the dam-break process. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data of Lobovský et al. to validate the accuracy and stability of the present method by assessing the impact pressure on the side wall.
The dam-break configuration is illustrated in Fig. 6. The computational domain measures 1610 × 600 × 150 mm, with an initial water column of 600 × 300 mm indicated in blue, while the remainder is filled with air. The top boundary is set as a pressure outlet, and the other boundaries are treated as no-slip solid walls. Pressure sensors P1–P4 are located at 3, 15, 30, and 80 mm above the bottom. The initial water shape is imposed through a user-defined field function and released at the start of the simulation. This allows the fluid to collapse under gravity. Fig. 7 illustrates the evolution of the water column and the associated free-surface deformation during the dam-break process. Once the simulation commences, the fluid collapses under gravity (Fig. 7 (a)) and propagates along the bottom wall (Fig. 7 (c)). After a short time, it impinges on the left wall and climbs upward (Fig. 7 (d)). The subsequent downward motion, driven by gravity, interacts with the incoming flow, producing splashing and overturning (Fig. 7 (e)). The overturned jet then descends and ultimately fragments (Fig. 7 (f)). The numerical predictions show good agreement with experimental observations, capturing the principal features of the water motion throughout the process. Thus, the numerical approach can accurately reproduce the green water process on deck.

Fig. 8 presents the pressure time histories recorded at sidewall sensors P1–P4 for an initial water height of H = 300 mm. The pressure variations reflect the dam-break dynamics described earlier. Upon the first impact of the water on the sidewall, the pressure rises progressively to a peak and then decreases as the water recedes. When the returning flow interacts with the water remaining near the bottom and strikes the wall again, a secondary peak appears. At P1–P3, this second peak is considerably smaller than the first, whereas at P4 the two peaks are nearly equal. This behavior arises because P4 is located higher on the wall, where the climbing water has already lost substantial momentum. As a result, the two impact pressures are comparable.

Fig. 8. Time histories of pressure variation: (a) P1; (b) P2; (c) P3; (d) P4.

During the two peak pressure stages (around 2.5 s and 6 s), the numerical predictions show good agreement with the experimental data in both magnitude and trends. In contrast, during the trough phase (3–6 s), a noticeable discrepancy appears. This deviation primarily arises from differences between the actual atmospheric conditions in the physical experiment and the idealized constant atmospheric assumed in the numerical model, which affects the static pressure level. Furthermore, incomplete resolution of the pressure peaks in the simulation also contributes to the observed error. Although minor deviations exist between the simulated and experimental results in free-surface elevation and impact pressure, such differences are expected due to the idealized test conditions and inherent measurement limitations.
Fig. 9 compares the non-dimensional free-surface height ℎ/H at gauges H1–H4 with the Lobovský measurements for the dam-break case. The variation of the H1 curve represents the collapse process of the water body, showing an overall decreasing trend. During the simulation, the H2, H3, and H4 curves exhibit two sudden rises in the free surface, corresponding to the first passage of the collapsing water front and the subsequent passage after the water overturns. A comparison between the experimental measurements and numerical results shows good agreement before the water overturning and breaking occur. After the onset of breaking, certain discrepancies appear, which can be attributed to the randomness of the fragmented water motion and the air-water entrainment effects. These factors introduce minor errors in capturing the free-surface profile during the breaking stage, consistent with observations reported in previous studies.

Overall, the numerical simulation faithfully reproduces the dam-break process, exhibiting good agreement with the experiment in both trend and magnitude, including the time histories of free-surface run-up at representative gauges (H1–H4). Although the present validation is based on the classical dam-break experiment rather than a ship model test, it effectively captures the key impulsive free-surface features relevant to green water impacts, namely the pressure peaks, the two post-impact surges, and the associated run-up evolution. Therefore, this case has been widely employed in related studies to verify numerical solvers. This validation confirms that the present CFD method can capture the essential physics of violent free-surface impacts, providing a reliable foundation for the subsequent simulations of ship-wave interactions.
3.3. Validation of KCS ship motions in regular waves
Since accurate prediction of ship motions is closely related to the analysis of green water phenomena on deck, the present study first simulates the motions of the KCS (KRISO Container Ship) in regular waves using a three-dimensional numerical wave tank. Recognized as a widely used benchmark hull form in ship hydrodynamics, the KCS ship model is adopted in this section with a scale ratio of 1/37.89 to investigate ship motions in waves. The present study simulates five different regular wave conditions to validate the heave and pitch motions of the KCS ship. The detailed wave parameters are listed in Table 2, and the designed forward speed is 2.007 m/s. The heave and pitch motion transfer functions are defined as TF3 and TF5, respectively:

(9)
Where 
3 and 
5 represent the first-harmonic amplitudes of the heave and pitch time histories, respectively; A denotes the incident wave amplitude; calculated as A = H/2; k is the wave number given by k = 2π/λ. The numerical wave tank adopts the same water depth as that used in the study of grid and time-step convergence. The water depth is h = 5.4 m and corresponds to deep-water conditions for all regular-wave cases.

Based on the numerical results, the motion responses of the ship stabilized after approximately 20 encounter wave periods. Therefore, the comparison with experimental results was conducted using the simulation outputs after 20 waves. Fig. 10 presents the error comparison between the first-harmonic amplitudes obtained from the present numerical simulations and those measured in physical experiments under different wave conditions. Compared with Lee et al. (2002) simulation results, the present numerical method shows better agreement with the experimental data. Except for Case 2, the heave and pitch motion errors within the encounter period are all below 5 %. Notably, in Lee's study, the pitch motion error for Case 2 reached as high as 55 % compared with the experimental measurements, while the present method yields a significantly smaller error of 13 %. However, this value is still relatively large when compared with the other cases. Seo and Jeong (2019) attributed such discrepancies to wave reflection effects, suggesting that the large error in short-wavelength conditions may stem from numerical diffusion inherent in the VOF method.

Overall, under various wave conditions, the numerical predictions of the ship's heave and pitch motions show good agreement with the experimental results in both magnitude and trend, indicating that the present numerical approach is capable of accurately simulating ship motions in regular waves.
4. Ship model and computational mesh
Accurate representation of the ship geometry and well-defined computational mesh are essential for reliable simulation results. This section therefore begins with a description of the ship model, followed by the details of the mesh configuration.
4.1. Ship model description
In this study, the KCS container ship model is selected for numerical simulation of green water impact under rogue wave conditions. To ensure that the ship's freeboard and the focused wave height satisfy overtopping requirements, a relatively large scale ratio of 1/85.19 is adopted for the model. Additionally, a rectangular structure measuring 0.27 (length) × 0.24 (width) × 0.20 m (height) is positioned 0.32 m ahead of the bow to represent the superstructure. Detailed dimensions and the geometric configuration are provided in Table 3 and Fig. 11.

4.2. Computational mesh and boundary conditions
To ensure simulation accuracy, the computational domain should be as large as feasible. However, the actual computational cost must also be considered. Consequently, the domain dimensions are defined as shown in Fig. 12 (−2 ≤ x/LPP ≤ 3, −1 ≤ y/LPP ≤ 1, −2 ≤ z/LPP ≤ 1), corresponding to a water depth of h = 2LPP = 5.4 m. This includes the overlapping region containing the ship (−0.3 m ≤ x ≤ 3 m, −0.378 m ≤ y ≤ 0 m, −0.25 m ≤ z ≤ 0.35 m). The left boundary of the computational domain (x/LPP = −2) is set as the wave-generation boundary and specified as a velocity inlet. The right boundary (x/LPP = 3) is defined as a pressure outlet. To suppress wave reflection, the region aft of the ship (1 ≤ x/LPP ≤ 3) is treated as a damping zone, with a damping coefficient of 0.75 employed to ensure effective wave absorption (Liu et al., 2022). All remaining boundaries are defined as velocity inlets to maintain simulation accuracy. To accurately resolve the wave-ship interaction, the mesh near the ship is locally refined. The computational domain is divided into the background region, overlapping region, free-surface region, and impact region, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Within the free-surface region, the mesh size in the z-direction is set to 1/20 of the focused wave height, and the aspect ratio in the x, y, and z directions is maintained below 4:4:1. In the impact region, the mesh is refined into cubic cells with side length A/20, where A denotes the focused wave amplitude. Conversely, the background region is progressively coarsened, as it is located far from the ship and requires fewer details. This strategy reduces the total number of elements while preserving accuracy in regions critical to the wave-ship interaction. Summing the background, overset, free-surface, and impact regions, the CFD grid contains a total of approximately 3 × 106 cells.

A numerical simulation is performed for the KCS container ship model under Case III rogue wave conditions. Using a two-way CFD-FEM coupling approach, we investigate the green water response on the deck of the elastic ship. This coupling compensates for the overestimation of slamming pressure that occurs when structural deformations are neglected. It also enables a comprehensive analysis of hydroelastic effects on slamming. Based on previous experimental studies, the Young's modulus of the ship structure is set to E = 210 GPa with Poisson's ratio μ = 0.3. In the DFBI model, the ship is allowed to move with two degrees of freedom: vertical translation along the z-axis (heave) and rotation about the y-axis (pitch). In the corresponding FEM model, the main hull, deck, and superstructure are all modeled using a uniform material density of 7850 kg/m3. The total mass, center of gravity, and pitch moment of inertia of the flexible ship are kept consistent with those of the rigid DFBI model. All structural components are uniformly set with a Young's modulus of 210 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and the shell thickness is uniformly set to 0.005 m. Consequently, the differences between the rigid and flexible simulations can be attributed mainly to hydroelastic effects, rather than to changes in mass distribution or inertia. To ensure consistency with the rigid ship defined in the DFBI model, a compliant ship structure is designed by adjusting the shell thickness and density to match its mass. Global ship motions are captured through the DFBI module, while local structural deformations are realized by applying mesh morphing to the ship surface. As shown in Fig. 14, the finite element mesh consists of 31,992 quadrilateral shell elements (S4R) and 228 triangular shell elements (S3R). The FEM shell mesh size is controlled to be comparable to the CFD surface mesh size, ensuring stable mesh mapping and reliable data exchange between the two solvers.

5. Slamming response of rigid and flexible ship
Before analyzing the hydroelastic responses of the flexible ship, this study first investigates the slamming behavior of the rigid ship. This helps to identify the influence of structural deformation on slamming loads. To capture the slamming loads on the rigid ship, pressure sensors were strategically placed in key structural regions. In particular, the bow, deck, and superstructure were instrumented.
5.1. Rigid ship under different operating conditions
5.1.1. Bow region
The bow is the first part of the ship to encounter incoming waves. Its slamming response is particularly significant. We placed 15 pressure monitoring points on three transverse sections. The points were spaced 0.485 m apart in the y-direction (0.125B, where B = 3.876 m). The vertical spacing was 0.056 m in the z-direction (0.25D, where D = 0.223 m). Fig. 15 illustrates the detailed sensor locations.

Fig. 15. Arrangement of pressure sensors at the bow.

The ship was numerically simulated under three rogue wave conditions with different focused wave heights. The pressure variation at each monitoring point was recorded. Fig. 16 presents the relationship between the peak pressure at each sensor and the focused wave height. The results show that the peak pressure at all points increases with increasing wave height. Among them, PP5, PP1-5, and PP2-5 exhibit a steeper growth rate compared with the other points. This is because the section at z = 0.25D is farther from the water surface, where the incoming waves produce stronger slamming effects. Overall, under the same wave condition, although the absolute peak pressures differ among the monitoring points, the relative ranking of the peak values remains consistent. The maximum pressure always occurs at the PP5. The peak pressure decreases as the section moves farther from the midship. A similar trend is observed in the vertical direction: the farther a measurement point is from the keel plane, the lower the peak pressure. This behavior is attributed to gravity and bow slamming during the upward climbing phase of the rogue wave, which reduce the wave's speed and energy. Consequently, the peak pressure attenuates both across the ship's beam and along its depth. Since the bow is the first region impacted by the rogue wave, it receives the greatest wave energy and velocity. This results in the maximum peak pressure at PP5. Moreover, as the focused wave height increases, the peak pressure at all measurement points on each section also rises. These results confirm that rigid-ship assumptions may overpredict bow pressures. Incorporating hydroelastic responses yields more realistic estimates, which is essential for avoiding overly conservative designs.

5.1.2. Deck region
The deck plays a vital role in reinforcing the ship structure, storing cargo, and influencing the ship's overall strength and buoyancy. In this study, four pressure sensors were placed along the midship section in the x-direction, with a spacing of 0.08 m. In addition, sensors PPD1-1, PPD1-2, and PPD2-1 were positioned on two transverse sections at y = 0.125B and y = 0.25B to capture the three-dimensional pressure effects during the green water impact process. The detailed sensor arrangement is shown in Fig. 17.

Fig. 17. Arrangement of pressure sensors at the deck.

Analysis of peak pressures recorded by the deck sensors of the rigid ship shows that peak pressures occur at sensors located closer to the bow. In Fig. 18 (a), the peak pressures at PPD1 and PPD2 on the y = 0 section are relatively similar. This is because the second wave impact involves a larger water volume and a wider impact area, causing both sensors to register comparable peak values. Under different working conditions, the location of the peak pressure shifts, which can be attributed to the changes in the center of gravity of water mass during the second wave impact. Under the same wave condition, sensors located closer to the midship section record higher peak pressure. Specifically, the peak pressure at PPD2-1 is lower than that at PPD1-2, which is lower than at PPD4. This is because the green water elevation reaches its maximum at the midship section, resulting in the strongest impact on the deck. In Fig. 18 (b), the peak pressures at PPD1-2 and PPD2-1 are relatively similar. This is due to the smaller water volume falling onto the x = 0.24 m section, which leads to reduced impact pressure. Overall, the results indicate that as the focused wave height increases, the peak pressure at all measurement points of the rigid ship also rises. The comparison demonstrates that hydroelastic effects substantially alter deck pressure predictions. Thus, design evaluations based solely on rigid-ship models may misrepresent true load levels, highlighting the importance of flexible-ship analysis in structural assessments.

5.1.3. Superstructure region
Horizontal impact forces on the superstructure can cause more severe damage to the ship. Understanding their variation is crucial for guiding future structural designs. In this study, we arranged nine pressure monitoring points on the forward-facing surface of the superstructure. This surface corresponds to the front face of the rectangular structure facing the bow. These points are spaced at 0.06 m intervals in the y-direction and 0.025 m intervals in the z-direction. Fig. 19 shows the detailed layout of the monitoring points.

Fig. 19. Arrangement of pressure sensors at the superstructure.

The variation of peak pressure at the superstructure monitoring points of the rigid ship under different focused wave heights is presented in Fig. 20. Under smaller focused wave heights, the impact pressure induced by green water is nearly negligible, as the overtopping water volume is insufficient to reach the superstructure. Nevertheless, a distinct peak pressure is recorded at sensor PPW3. This demonstrates that irrespective of wave height, the maximum pressure consistently occurs at the location closest to both the deck and the ship's centerline. As the distance from the deck increases, the peak pressure at each measurement point gradually decreases. A similar trend appears along the beam y-direction, where the peak pressure diminishes with increasing distance from the ship's centerline. The slamming pressure on the superstructure increases with the focused wave height. When the focused wave height exceeds a certain critical value, the peak pressure rises sharply, indicating a nonlinear response of the superstructure under extreme wave conditions. The nonlinear response of the superstructure further illustrates that hydroelasticity can significantly reduce peak pressures compared with rigid assumptions, emphasizing the necessity of including flexibility in predictive models.

5.2. Comparative analysis of slamming loads: rigid vs flexible ship
To evaluate the influence of hydroelasticity on slamming loads, we conducted a comparative analysis between the rigid and flexible ships. The following subsections present a region-by-region comparison. We begin with the bow, followed by the deck and superstructure.
5.2.1. Comparative analysis in the bow region
Hydroelastic effects do not induce significant changes in the flow field in this study. As a result, the pressure variation trends of the flexible and rigid ships are generally similar. Although the rogue waves considered represent relatively severe sea conditions, the ship's high structural stiffness limits how minor flow field variations affect the focused process of the largest wave.
Fig. 21 shows the pressure time histories at monitoring points on the y = 0, y = 0.125B, and y = 0.25B sections in the bow region. The pressure variation trends are similar across all sections. Two distinct pressure peaks appear during the slamming process in the bow region. The first peak occurs at approximately 7.25 s, while the second peak appears around 8.5 s. These correspond to two separate green water events on the deck. Pressure sensors located on the z = 0.25D section (PP5, PP1-5, and PP2-5) exhibit non-zero pressure fluctuations between 0 s and 6 s. These points are situated below the free-surface, so the measured pressure includes both hydrostatic and impact components. Similar fluctuations also appear at sensors on the z = 0.5D section (PP4, PP1-4, and PP2-4). Across all sections in the bow region, the pressure variation trends at different monitoring points remain consistent. Two pressure peaks occur during the slamming process, with the second peak generally larger than the first. This primarily results from the larger water volume and more violent ship motion during the second green water event. Overall, as the distance between the monitoring points and the midship section increases, the difference between the two peak pressures gradually decreases.

Analysis of the pressure reduction rates at each sensor across the different sections (Table 4 (a), 4 (b), and 4 (c)) shows that at y = 0, y = 0.125B, and y = 0.25B, the peak pressures on the flexible ship decrease by 8.92 %, 10.89 %, and 19.66 %, respectively, compared to the rigid ship. These reductions are substantial and merit attention from researchers. Accounting for hydroelastic effects during the slamming event provides a buffer effect due to ship deformation. This decreases the slamming pressure relative to that on a rigid ship. The spatial distribution of hydroelastic effects on slamming pressure in the bow region indicates that sensors closer to the deck experience greater pressure reduction. This influence diminishes with increasing distance from the upper deck. Along the beam direction, sensors located at the centerline are less affected by hydroelasticity, whereas the effect increases for sensors positioned farther from the centerline. These results suggest that hydroelasticity primarily acts as a secondary influence on slamming pressure, manifested through changes in the flow field and water impact behavior due to ship deformation. From a design perspective, even modest reductions due to hydroelasticity demonstrate that rigid-ship predictions may overestimate fatigue loading, and incorporating flexibility leads to more accurate safety margins.

5.2.2. Comparative analysis in the deck region
Compared to the bow region, hydroelastic effects have a more pronounced influence on deck pressure. As shown in Fig. 22, at the PPD1-1 location, the double-peak feature of the pressure signal is less distinct. Consequently, the slamming pressure behavior of the flexible ship does not follow the same trend observed in the rigid ship analysis presented earlier in this study. Analysis of peak pressure variation in the deck region (Table 5 (a) and 5 (b)) indicates that the average pressure reduction reaches 26.60 % and 37.13 %, respectively. This substantial reduction underscores the importance of accounting for hydroelastic effects, especially under the severe rogue wave conditions examined in this study. Neglecting hydroelasticity may lead to an overestimation of slamming pressure, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of structural strength assessments in ship design. Analysis of the spatial distribution of hydroelastic effects on deck pressure reveals a trend similar to that observed in the bow region. Pressure reductions are most pronounced at measurement points near the superstructure around the midship area. Following the initial wave impact on the bow, some wave energy is dissipated due to ship deformation, leading to a notable attenuation of the first pressure peak in the deck region. The second peak undergoes even greater decay, as it follows the first green water event. Furthermore, since the pressure values at certain points in the deck region are already relatively low, the pressure reduction rate may be somewhat overestimated. Repeated physical experiments would help further validate this conclusion and provide more accurate data. For ship designers, this means that without considering hydroelasticity, deck impact loads may be miscalculated, potentially leading to either unsafe or excessively conservative designs.

5.2.3. Comparative analysis in the superstructure region
Among all the ship regions analyzed in this study, the superstructure is the most affected by slamming response of the rigid and flexible ship hydroelasticity. As shown in Fig. 23, although the timing of the two slamming events remains consistent, the peak pressures differ significantly, particularly for the first peak. This further confirms that hydroelasticity primarily influences peak pressure during the slamming process. When hydroelasticity effects are considered, ship deformation acts as a buffer that delays the rapid rise of peak pressure over a short period. In contrast, the second pressure peak in both slamming events closely resembles that of the rigid ship. This is because the second peak results from the gravitational fall of the water, producing a weaker impact and consequently less ship deformation.

Analysis of the peak pressure change rates between the rigid and flexible ships in the superstructure region (Fig. 23) does not show the consistent pattern observed in the bow and deck regions. This discrepancy arises from the distinct impact characteristics of the superstructure and the highly nonlinear water behavior following violent deck motions. These factors increase the complexity of the superstructure's response. The wide variation in pressure change rates in the superstructure region prevented calculation of an average reduction. However, Table 6 shows that the pressure at PPW2 decreased by 61.36 %. Reductions at the other sensors were around 30 %, which is greater than those observed in the bow and deck regions. Since the peak pressures at PPW1, PPW1-1, and PPW2-1 of the rigid ship were nearly zero, they were not included in the comparative analysis of peak pressures in this study.

Measurement point	PPW3	PPW2	PPW1-3	PPW1-2	PPW2-3	PPW2-2
Elastic peak pressure	446	85	345	84	208	56
Rigid peak pressure	671	220	530	116	356	91
Rate of change	−33.53 %	−61.36 %	−34.1 %	−27.59 %	−41.57 %	−38.46 %
It can be concluded that, compared to a rigid ship, slamming pressures are reduced to varying degrees when hydroelasticity is taken into account. This reduction becomes more significant as the slamming process progresses, beginning at the bow, then the deck, and finally the superstructure. Ship deformation caused by the impact feeds back into the flow field, resulting in wave energy loss that accumulates over the course of the slamming process. Overall, the measurement points near the deck and superstructure, especially those farther from the ship's centerline, are more sensitive to the effects of hydroelasticity and show greater pressure reduction. This highlights that flexible-ship simulations are indispensable for evaluating superstructure impacts, as rigid models may not capture the true pressure reduction caused by structural deformation.
6. Conclusions
In this study, a numerical simulation was conducted to investigate slamming loads at the bow, deck, and superstructure of a ship under rogue wave conditions. Pressure monitoring points were arranged along the ship's beam, length, and depth, enabling a three-dimensional analysis of slamming loads and their variation with different focused wave height. For the rigid ship, the peak pressure distribution exhibited clear spatial patterns. In the bow region, the highest values occurred near the bottom and decreased toward the free surface. On the deck, sensors located closer to the bow consistently recorded larger peaks than those near midship. In the superstructure, the greatest pressures were found near the deck and ship centerline. Across all three regions, the peak pressures increased with the focused wave height of the rogue wave. When hydroelasticity was considered through a two-way CFD-FEM approach, peak pressures were reduced in all regions, with reductions up to 61.36 %. The effect became more pronounced from the bow to the deck and superstructure, reflecting cumulative energy dissipation caused by structural deformation. Moreover, measurement points near the deck and superstructure are more sensitive to hydroelastic effects. Points farther from the midship section exhibit greater pressure reductions. These demonstrate that rigid ship assumptions tend to overestimate impact loads, while flexible ship simulations provide more realistic predictions. For flexible ships, the observed reduction in slamming pressure may be interpreted as a deformation-induced energy absorption effect associated with the local elastic response of the hull surface. When hydroelastic effects are considered, the hull surface no longer behaves as a rigid wall but as a deformable boundary, so that part of the impact energy is diverted into structural strain and kinetic energy and is released over a longer time and a wider area, rather than being converted immediately into highly localized pressure peaks. This interpretation is consistent with the trends reported in previous studies: Mai et al. (2020) showed through free-fall slamming tests that rigid plates experience much larger pressure and force impulses during the first impact, whereas the total impulse remains nearly unchanged. This indicates that elastic deformation redistributes the impact load in time, reducing the instantaneous peak and allowing part of the energy to be absorbed and released gradually through structural vibration. Similarly, Tavakoli et al. (2023) demonstrated that a portion of the incident impulse during flexible-plate water entry is transferred to the structure via fluid-structure momentum exchange, leading to markedly lower peak pressures compared with rigid plates.
These findings provide valuable guidance for improving ship structural design under extreme sea conditions. In particular, reinforcing critical areas such as the deck and superstructure can effectively mitigate green water impacts. Moreover, incorporating hydroelastic considerations into numerical analyses offers designers a more reliable basis for assessing safety margins and optimizing structural configurations.
Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between extreme nonlinear waves and marine structures has attracted growing attention from researchers worldwide. To further ensure the structural integrity and navigational safety of large marine structures under extreme wave conditions, future studies should incorporate ship bending moments, motions, and vibrations, and validate numerical predictions against large-scale physical experiments. It should be noted that the present analysis is performed at model scale and focuses on local slamming induced by a rogue-wave group that is designed to focus at the bow; in realistic seas, extreme groups may focus at other positions along the hull and under different headings, which may modify the hydroelastic response. In addition, although viscous effects are included in the RANS-based flow solver, the separate influence of viscous dissipation and structural damping has not been quantified and will be examined in future work.
