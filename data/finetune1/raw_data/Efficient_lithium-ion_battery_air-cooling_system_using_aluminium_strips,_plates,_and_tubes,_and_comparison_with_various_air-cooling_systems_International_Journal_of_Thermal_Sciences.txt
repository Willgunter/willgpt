1. Introduction
In the current context, the transition towards sustainable energy sources has become crucial to cope with environmental pollution and counter the declining accessibility of fossil fuel reservoirs. Among the various technological innovations shaping this shift, electric vehicles (EVs) stand out as a viable, alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, which run on fossil fuels. The battery system is the core of EVs and hybrid vehicles (HEVs), functioning as the main energy source. Li-ion batteries have gained widespread adoption in propelling EVs due to their notable features, including exceptional energy density, operational efficiency, and long lifespan [1]. Despite these advantages, the performance and safety of li-ion batteries are highly sensitive to temperature [2].High temperatures inside the cells impair battery performance, and thermal runaway of the battery occurs in severely high-temperature conditions. Therefore, for the proper operation of a BP, it is necessary to maintain the operating temperature of li-ion cells within the optimal range of 15–35 °C, which is essential for achieving a balance between performance, safety, and lifespan [3,4].
Another critical challenge in BP operation is the uneven temperature distribution among individual cells. Uneven temperature distribution not only affects cell performance but also leads to unbalanced charging and discharging rates, ultimately accelerating battery degradation. As reported in Ref. [5], increased temperature disparities among the cells directly affects unbalanced discharging and premature aging. Consequently, maintaining a ΔT below 5 °C within a battery module is considered vital for ensuring stable performance and extended cycle life of the cell.
Recent advances in heat transfer and fluid dynamics have provided valuable insights into addressing thermal non-uniformity in energy systems. Studies such as [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]] have employed fractional-order and artificial intelligence-based approaches to analyze magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) and non-Newtonian nano-fluid heat transfer. These investigations demonstrated improved heat dissipation and temperature regulation in complex thermal environments. Furthermore, fractional Caputo-based formulations [12]utilized to investigate convective behaviour in porous and oscillatory flow regimes, while analyses of boundary-driven oscillatory transport [13] have demonstrated how dynamic flow forcing affects heat transfer characteristics. These developments collectively strengthen the understanding of unsteady and non-linear heat-transfer processes, providing a solid theoretical foundation for designing more effective and adaptive thermal management systems such as BTMS.
To ensure proper cooling performance and minimize temperature disparity, an efficient BTMS is important. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively investigated various BTMS designs, broadly categorized based on their cooling medium, including air cooling [[14], [15], [16]], liquid cooling [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], and phase change material (PCM)-based cooling [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Moreover, recent hybrid cooling studies, such as Aali et al. [27] have shown that combining PCMs with nanoparticles and metal baffles can substantially enhance heat dissipation and thermal uniformity, offering valuable insights for improving BTMS efficiency.
Among these, air-cooled BTMS have attracted considerable attention due to its simplicity, low cost, lightweight construction, minimal energy consumption, and no risk of leakage of the cooling fluid, making them particularly suitable for compact EV applications.
Saw et al. [28]conducted a CFD-based evaluation of air-cooled BPs, while Mahamud and Park [29] enhanced the temperature distribution by improving upon a unidirectional airflow model by introducing a reciprocating airflow system using flip door valves, achieving a more uniform temperature distribution. Yang et al. [30] proposed an axial flow air-cooling system featuring a bionic surface structure, which reduced the temperature variation and power consumption by 8.1 % and 15.54 %, respectively, compared to the conventional design. Similarly, Jilte et al. [31] emphasized the importance of design optimization for enhancing cooling efficiency and minimizing temperature gradients.
Further, Yue et al. [32] demonstrated that locating the air inlet and outlet on opposite sides of the BP results in improved thermal performance, which was further enhanced by adding baffles to guide airflow. Erb et al. [33] developed predictive models to link cell size with air-cooling costs, while Sefidan et al. [34]incorporated nano-fluids into forced-air systems, significantly minimizing cell temperatures. Additionally, Xun et al. [35] analysed the effect of cooling channel geometry on thermal behaviour in both prismatic and cylindrical battery modules during discharging operations.
Researchers have recognized that structural configuration and geometric parameters play a pivotal role in improving the thermal performance of air-cooled BTMS. Therefore, structural optimization has been an important focus in recent research. Safikhani et al. [36] demonstrated through an energy–exergy-based CFD study that optimized structural configurations in compact heat exchangers, which significantly improve heat transfer while reducing energy losses and pressure drop—principles equally valuable for BTMS design. Similarly, Chen et al. [37] optimized a Z-shaped BTMS using a flow resistance network model, achieving enhanced airflow uniformity through the use of divergence and convergence plenums. Yang et al. [38] investigated Z-type and U-type systems incorporating inlet spoilers, achieving significant improvements in cooling efficiency. Zhang et al. [39]further showed that a configuration with a single central top inlet and four bottom outlets provides the best thermal performance due to improved air distribution.
Given that airflow characteristics strongly influence BTMS performance, several studies have explored the effects of varying operational parameters. Yi et al. [40] examined how discharge rate and inlet air velocity affect thermal performance, while Cho et al. [41]observed that at high ambient temperatures, temperature differences among cells decrease, but at lower ambient temperatures, the temperature differences among cells increase. Fan et al. [42] reported that higher air velocities reduce both the Tmax and ΔT due to increased convective heat transfer. However, Liu et al. [43] found that excessive flow rates yield diminishing returns beyond a certain flow rate. He et al. [44] further highlighted that excessive inlet velocity reduces air utilization efficiency, emphasizing the need for optimized airflow design.
Despite these advancements, conventional air-cooling systems remain limited due to low convective heat transfer coefficient of air, particularly under high C-rate conditions, often resulting in higher maximum temperatures and poor uniformity. To overcome these challenges, several innovative approaches have been proposed. Jiaqiang et al. [45] introduced baffles within an air-cooled BTMS to promote mixing and enhance cooling performance. Zhou et al. [46] surrounded each cell with a hollow air channel to facilitate direct convective cooling, while Park [47] optimized manifold geometry using a tapered outlet with pressure-relief holes, achieving effective thermal management without significant design modifications. However, these configurations were limited by the complex geometry and increased bulkiness of the BP, which restricted the practical applicability of these configurations.
To address this limitation, several researchers integrated fins and extended surfaces into BPs to enhance heat transfer. Mohammadian and Zhang [48] utilized a linearly varying pin-fin heat sink to improve temperature uniformity, while Öztop and Sahinaslan [49] numerically investigated the effect of longitudinal fins of different heights and numbers and observed substantial reductions in Tmax of the cell. Qin et al. [50] experimentally validated an internally finned design maintaining a ΔT below 5 °C at 4C discharge. Yang et al. [51] further demonstrated that bionic surface structures—triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal, and elliptical—encircle cylindrical cells to enhance the heat transfer from the cells. Complementarily, Omar and Adham [52] reported that fins combined with PCM and forced convection improve prismatic-cell cooling, and Alzwayi and Paul [53] showed that incorporating spiral fins into an air-cooled BTMS reduced the Tmax of 21700 cells from 60.9 °C to 47.9 °C.
The above-reviewed literature clearly indicates that the use of fins can significantly enhance heat transfer within a BP, leading to better cooling performance of the BTMS. However, these studies show some gaps. Most investigations of BTMS with fins have focused on prismatic cells, where connecting a fin is relatively easy. However, only a few studies are available on cylindrical cells, where mounting thin longitudinal fins on curved surfaces poses considerable challenges. Research to date shows that the integration of fins on the surface of a cylindrical cell has been applied only to individual cells. These fins are either longitudinal, spiral, or circumferential in shape. While these configurations improve heat dissipation at the single-cell level, they fail to achieve effective thermal uniformity across the entire BP. A persistent drawback of an air-cooled BP is that the cells near the inlet remain the coolest, while those near the outlet become the hottest. Consequently, these types of fins fail to maintain a consistent temperature uniformity across all the cells inside the BP. Furthermore, the incorporation of fins or manifold in the BP creates a wide gap between the cells, significantly reduces the volumetric energy density, and increases the overall structural complexity of the BP.
To bridge these gaps, this study proposes an innovative air-cooled BP design that incorporates highly conductive structural elements such as strips, plates, and tubes, which function as compact passive heat spreaders, performing a role similar to fins but takes too much less space than fins and reducing geometrical complexity. Unlike conventional fin arrangements that dissipate heat locally from individual cells, the proposed conductive configuration enables efficient heat transfer across the entire BP and significantly reduces the parasitic power of the BP. The primary objective of this study is to address critical issues that affect the performance of a BP: (1) higher temperature inside the BP, (2) uneven temperature distribution within the pack, (2) elevated temperatures at the centre and tips of the cells, (3) heat accumulation in the central region of the BP. Furthermore, the performance of the novel BTMS is compared with the conventional natural air-cooling and forced air-cooling type BTMS. Also, simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the novel BTMS vis-à-vis U-type, Z-type, and T-type BTMS, which are commonly used variants of forced air-cooling BTMS. This comparative study also includes a BTMS using longitudinal fins. CFD simulations of U-type, Z-type, T-type, and longitudinal fin-type BTMS are conducted for the same pack size and operating conditions as the novel BTMS, and the results of these studies are used for comparing with the performance of the novel BTMS.
Overall, this innovative design is simple, cost-effective, and easy to manufacture. Here, aluminium, used as the conductive material, is lightweight, highly conductive, and easily available, making this design suitable for practical large-scale applications. Considering its simplicity, affordability, and material availability, the proposed system offers strong potential for real-world implementation in air-cooled BTMS.
2. CFD modelling of BTMS
2.1. Three-dimensional model of BTMS
This study utilizes a BP comprising 36 number of cylindrical Li-ion cells, organized into a configuration of 6 cells in series and 6 cells in parallel. Terminals of these cells are interconnected via aluminium-made connectors.18650 Li-ion cells are used in the present study. In a typical lithium-ion cell, components include current collectors, a negative electrode (typically made of carbon, such as graphite), a positive electrode (comprising metal oxides like LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4), and a separator. In this paper LiFePO4 is considered as the cathode material because of its superior performance.
The cells have 65 mm length and 18 mm diameter. There are 6 number of rows of cells, and each row contains 6 number of cells. The cells are electrically interconnected in series and parallel by using busbars made of aluminium. The busbars are of 2 mm width and 1 mm thickness. A gap of 1 mm is considered between adjacent cells. The pack has 115 mm × 115mm × 72 mm outer size. Strips, plates, and tubes of aluminium are included in different configurations of the BP in a step-by-step manner, which will be elaborated later, in order to enhance cooling efficiency of BTMS. Six number of aluminium strips – 108 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm are inserted between two adjacent rows of cells. Length of the strips are in the direction of airflow in the BTMS. In a particular configuration, 3 number of aluminium tubes of 108 mm length and 10 mm × 3mm × 0.5 mm thick rectangular cross section are used in place of the strips in the central row of cells in order to dissipate more heat from the central region of the BP. In another configuration, two number of aluminium plates of 113 mm × 113 mm × 1 mm thickness are used at the top and bottom of the cells to improve heat transfer from the terminals of the cells. A thin layer of thermal interface material is applied over the busbars to avoid a possible short circuit due to the installation of the plates over the busbars. Fig. 1 shows 3D model of the BTMS including cells, strips, tubes, and plates. For effective heat dissipation, ambient air is utilized as working fluid to transfer heat from the BP to the environment. Forced airflow is directed through the BP using a fan. This novel BP system is analysed to assess efficient heat dissipation under varying discharge rates with modifications of inlet position.

This model takes a simple approach by disregarding the various processes in the negative and positive electrodes, and the electrolyte, while considering a lumped parameter for all voltage losses in the cell mainly due to ohmic resistances, and also because of charge transfer and diffusion processes. This model is particularly suitable when detail information about chemistry and internal structure of the cell is not available.

2.3. Boundary conditions
The following boundary conditions are used: air velocity of 0.2 m/s and air temperature of 28 °C at the inlet, 1 atm pressure at the outlet, no slip condition at the inner wall of BP, and convection heat transfer coefficient = 30 W/m2K at the outer wall of BP. The discharge rates of 2 C and 4 C were selected to represent moderate and high-power conditions, respectively, while the ambient temperature and initial temperature of the Li-ion BP are considered to be 28 °C. State of Charge (SOC) is considered to change from fully charged to 20 % charge remaining. These conditions are frequently observed in real-world operations and commonly adopted in previous BTMS studies [56].
COMSOL Multiphysics v.6.1 software is utilized to simulate this complex model, employing the finite element method to discretize the governing equations. A transient backward differentiation solver is used. Lumped battery model in conjunction with 3-D heat transfer model is used to compute heat distribution within the BP.
2.4. Grid independence test
The present research employed COMSOL Multiphysics to create a 3-D battery model. Use COMSOL Multiphysics to create mesh for the 3-D battery model. A physics-controlled mesh was chosen to ensure optimum mesh distribution in battery models. The battery model's accuracy is directly impacted by number of grid elements. While a higher number of mesh elements typically leads to enhanced accuracy, lower grid counts may compromise calculation precision, though this relationship is not absolute.
To ensure optimal accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency, a grid independence test is conducted prior to evaluating the thermal performance of the BP. Specifically, this test focused on calculating the Tmax and pressure within the BP at 4C rate for the grids with different number of elements. The findings, depicted in Fig. 2, reveal that battery temperature and pressure vary by merely 0.13 % and 0.18 % respectively, while increasing the number of cells from 1.7 million to 2.25 million. Considering an optimum number of elements to achieve a precise calculation and reduce the calculation time, the grid number 1.7 × 106 is selected for all models in this study.

2.5. Validation of the CFD model
Validation of the CFD model is very essential for ensuring its accuracy. To enhance the accuracy of the simulation, the CFD model is validated against experimental results, which are considered the most reliable method for verifying the model's performance. It may be noted that the BTMS model presented in this paper is completely novel. No experimental study with this BTMS configuration is available in the literature. Therefore, the validation study is conducted by developing a CFD model for an air-cooled BTMS as per the configuration presented in the experimental study by Bethi et al. [56]. The experimental battery model consists of 24 Li-ion 18650 cells arranged in 6 number of rows and four number of columns, with a 2 mm gap between adjacent cells and 1.5 C rate of discharge. The experiment was conducted under both natural and forced convection conditions. This configuration is very close to the BTMS model of this paper, excluding the aluminium strips, tubes, and plates. The configuration of Bethi et al. [56] is simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics in this paper to compare the CFD results with experimental data.
Fig. 3(a) presents the experimental and the CFD simulation results for variation of the temperature with time considering natural convection cooling at the battery outer wall, while Fig. 3(b) presents the same for forced air cooling condition. In both cases, the CFD simulation results are found to be very close to corresponding experimental data during major part of the discharging time. Particularly during the beginning and end of discharging, the CFD results are found to overlap with the experimental data. Maximum difference between the experimental result and the CFD model result is found to be 1.9 °C for natural convection cooling and 1.7 °C in case of forced air cooling. Closeness of present CFD model vis-à-vis experimental data shows that the present CFD model has high accuracy, and indicates positively towards conducting further CFD investigations with the novel BTMS.

3. Result and discussion
In a BP, the following issues are generally observed.
a)
High temperature of the cells. This is caused by the electrochemical reactions in the cells. Increase in the temperature of the cells reduces the storage efficiency and the life of cells. Also, an uncontrolled rise of the cell temperature may cause thermal runaway. Therefore, controlling the Tmax of the BP by using an appropriate thermal management system becomes very essential.
b)
Non-uniform temperature distribution across the cells. During charging and discharging cycles of the battery, all cells do not equally heated, which gives rise to non-uniform temperature distribution among the cells in the BP. It causes non-uniform charging/discharging among the cells, which may lead to overcharging of some cells. Overcharging reduces the life of the cells. Also, thermal runaway may take place. Non-uniform heat dissipation by the cooling system is a major reason behind this. Therefore, an appropriate design of the cooling system is necessary to address this issue.
c)
Elevated temperatures at the terminals of the cells. Thermal conductivity of li-ion cells is anisotropic due to the layered structures of the cells. Value of thermal conductivity is considerably higher than the same in the radial direction. As a result, terminals of the cells exhibit temperature, which is close to the temperature at the core of the cells. The thermal management system should have the appropriate means to remove the heat effectively from the terminals.
d)
Difficulty in removal of heat from the central region of the BP. In a large BP, the cells in the central region are surrounded by other cells from all sides. Therefore, removal of heat from this region becomes very difficult. As a result, this region accumulates more heat and attains higher temperature compared to the cells, which are near the boundary of the BP. Therefore, the BTMS should be appropriately designed for adequate heat removal from the central region of the BP and reducing the temperature of the cells in this region.
Air cooling by natural convection or forced convection has not been found to address the above-mentioned issues adequately and maintain battery Tmax and ΔT within desired limits. In the present work the above issues have been addressed by including strips, plates, and tubes of aluminium to enhance the heat transfer in an air-cooled BP. For understanding the impact of these elements on BTMS, these are incorporated in a step-by-step manner in different configurations/models. Brief descriptions of these models are presented in Table 2. All of these models have 36 number of cells in 6 × 6 arrangement. Numerical investigation starts with a BP, which is fully enclosed inside a casing and there is no flow of cooling air around the cells (model-1 or STBP) [55]. This is followed by model-2, where cooling air enters the BP from one side, flows around the cells and absorbs heat from them, and goes out from opposite side, thereby dissipating heat in the environment. These two models act as references to evaluate the efficacy of the new BTMS models (model-3 to model-6).
Table 2. Brief description of different models of the BTMS.

Models	Model's configuration
Model 1 or STBP	1 mm gap between the cells. Operates without forced air flow around the cells.
Model 2	Model 1 + Forced air flow for convection of heat from the BP. Air enters through one side of the pack and exits through the opposite side.
Model 3	Model 2 + Aluminium strips between the adjacent rows of cells to enhance the evenness of temperature in the BP. Six number of aluminium strips of 108 mm length, 5 mm width, and 1 mm thickness are inserted between two adjacent rows of cells. Length of the strips are along the direction of airflow in the BTMS.
Model 4	Model 3 + Aluminium plates at the top and bottom of the cells to improve heat transfer from the terminals. Two number of aluminium plates of 114 mm × 114 mm × 1 mm are used.
Model 5	Model 4 + Aluminium tubes in the central row to improve heat removal from battery central region. 3 number of aluminium tubes of 108 mm length and 10 mm × 3mm × 0.5 mm thick rectangular cross section are used in place of the strips in the central row of cells.
Model 6	Model 5 + Additional inlet at pack-bottom for further improvement of heat transfer from the central region of BP. Circular inlet of 50 mm diameter is made at the middle of the bottom surface of the BP in addition to the existing inlet. 0.85 m/s air velocity is applied at secondary inlet considering same airflow rate at both inlets.
The 3-D temperature distributions in the cells of different BTMS models considering 2C and 4C discharge rates are presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9. During the discharge period, the state of charge is considered to vary from 100 % to 20 %. Accordingly, the discharge periods of 24 min and 12 min are considered for 2C and 4C discharge rates, respectively. Purpose behind investigating the BTMS performance at different C-rates is to find out whether battery peak temperature is maintained in the optimal 15–35 °C range at these C-rates. Temperature distributions shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 are at 20 % SOC, where cell temperatures are much higher compared to the initial temperature of 28 °C due to heat generation in the cells. Nature of the temperature distributions at 2C and 4C rates are found to be same for all models. However, the values of temperature are found to much higher for 4C rate due to higher rate of heat generation. It may be noted that in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, the cells at the left side row are near the air-inlet and the cells at the right-side row are near the air-outlet. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show that temperature is not uniform in any cell in any BTMS model. Therefore, volume-averaged temperature of each cell is determined, based on which temperatures of the hottest cell and the coolest cell of each model are obtained. Average temperature of the hottest cell in a model is found to be somewhat lower than the Tmax shown in the colour bar of the corresponding temperature contour. Similarly, average temperature of the coolest cell in a model is found to be somewhat higher than the Tmin shown in the colour bar of the corresponding contour plot. ΔT in a model is calculated as the difference of average temperature between the hottest cell and the coolest cell.

Fig. 7. Temperature (°C) distribution in model-4 at 2C and 4C rates.

Temperature distributions for model-1 in Fig. 4 shows that the cells at the centre of the BP have significantly higher temperature compared to the cells near the boundary of the pack. This is because the cells at the central region are surrounded by other cells from all sides, and there is no airflow in this model. This makes the heat removal from these cells difficult. It causes accumulation of heat in the central region and corresponding temperature rise in the cells in these regions. Maximum cell-temperature of 43.7 °C and 49.5 °C for 2C and 4C rates, respectively, are observed in the central region of model-1. It may be noted that these temperature values are the volume-averaged temperatures of the hottest cells in model-1 at 2C and 4C-rates, as described in the previous paragraph. Cells near the wall of the BP dissipate heat to the environment by natural convection. Therefore, these cells are found to be cooler than the cells in the central region. The cells at the corner have greater area for heat dissipation. Therefore, these cells have the lowest temperature in the entire pack. However, natural convection at the BP wall is not adequate to reduce the cell temperature. Therefore, even the corner cells are much hotter than the initial cell temperature. Therefore, the minimum pack temperature of 37.2 °C and 43.6 °C are found with 2C and 4C discharge rates. ΔT in the pack is 6.5 °C and 5.9 °C at 2C and 4C-rates, respectively.
In model-2, cooling air of 28 °C temperature enters from the atmosphere into the BP through the left-side face and exits through the right-side face, thereby removing the heat generated in the cells to the environment by convection. This process improves battery cooling compared to model-1, as observed in Fig. 5. The Tmax of the BP is reduced significantly to 37.9 °C for 2C-rate and 44.9 °C for 4C-rate, while the minimum BP temperature decreases to 32.4 °C for 2C-rate and 35.7 °C for 4C-rate. However, ΔT is quite high in model-2 (9.2 °C) at 4C rate compared to 5.9 °C in model-1 at same C-rate. This is because, inadequate cooling in model-1 raises the temperature of all cells to a higher degree, which apparently improves the uniformity of temperature in model-1. However, in model-2, cells near inlet are cooled to a greater extent than the cells near the air-outlet, which increases the ΔT in model-2 than in model-1. Cells near air-inlet are found to be the coolest and the cells near air-outlet are the hottest. ΔT between the cells in the first row (near inlet) and the fourth row is quite large. However, ΔT between the fourth row and the sixth row (near outlet) is much lower. This is because, as the cooling air moves from inlet to outlet, it absorbs heat from battery, which increases temperature of air and gradually reduces the cooling ability of air. Heat gain by the air in the first few rows of cells is quite high, therefore it cannot cool the subsequent rows of cells significantly. Cells near the side-walls of the BP are found to be cooler than the cells in the middle region, because the cells near the side walls can transfer the heat to the surrounding by natural convection natural convection in addition to forced convection cooling by air-flow inside the BP.
In model-3 six number of aluminium strips (108 mm long, 5 mm wide, and 1 mm thick) are arranged between every two adjacent rows of cells in the direction of air flow from the inlet to the outlet, as shown in Fig. 1. Gap of 5 mm in the vertical direction is maintained between consecutive strips in a row, through which cooling air can pass. These strips help in heat transfer from the high temperature region to the low temperature region of the BP via conduction, thereby brining more uniformity of temperature among the cells. This is evident in Fig. 6, where temperature distribution in model-3 at 2C and 4C rates are presented. ΔT in the BP is found to be 4.9 °C for 2C rate and 7.1 °C for 4C rate, which is ∼2 °C lower than the same in model-2. Tmax of the BP in model-3 is 37 °C for 2C rate and 43.6 °C for 4C rate – somewhat lower compared to model-2. Therefore, inclusion of the aluminium strips is found to enhance the cooling performance of the BTMS by reducing the Tmax and the ΔT in the BP. If this arrangement in model-3 is compared to the BTMS including fins, then it appears that the present system is simpler. In addition, spacing between the cells is required to be increased significantly to install any type of fin in the BP, thus decreasing the volumetric energy density of the BP. However, it does not require to increase the cell-spacing to include the strips in the BP. Therefore, the present system has more compactness and better volume utilization compared to the finned BTMS. It is very easy and cheap to manufacture the strips and assemble them with the cells in the BP compared to the fins.
Thermal conductivity of the cell is significantly higher in the axial direction (30W/mK) than in the radial direction (1 W/mK) [56,57]. Therefore, the axial thermal resistance is considerably lower than the radial thermal resistance. This anisotropy of thermal conductivity in the cell leads to high temperature at the tips of the cell. Therefore, appropriate cooling of the tips of the cell can reduce the cell-temperature considerably. However, conventional forced air cooling is not sufficient for this purpose. In the present study aluminium plates of 113 mm × 113 mm × 1 mm dimensions are placed at the top of the top busbars and at the bottom of the bottom busbars in model-4 to dissipate the heat from the tips of the electrodes. Interfaces between the busbars and the aluminium plates are coated with a thin layer of TIM, which is thermally conductive but electrically insulating in order to avoid short circuit. Model-4 also contains the forced air-flow and the aluminium strips between the adjacent rows of cells. Temperature distribution in model-4 at 2C and 4C discharge rates are presented in Fig. 7, which clearly shows considerable reduction in the temperature of the BP. The aluminium plates absorb heat from the busbars, thereby reduces the Tmax of the BP to 35.5 °C at 2C rate and 42.4 °C at 4C rate. Also, the uniformity of temperature in the BP improves significantly. ΔT in model-4 is reduced to 3.2 °C at 2C rate and 5.3 °C at 4C rate, which is significantly lower than ΔT of 5.5 °C for 2C rate and 9.2 °C for 4C rate obtained with model-2, and also lower than ΔT of 4.9 °C for 2C rate and 7 °C for 4C rate obtained with model-3.
Model-4 is found to reduce the Tmax and the ΔT in the BP considerably. However, the cells near the centre of the BP are found to be higher than the cells near the BP wall. In order to solve this problem, three number of aluminium tubes of 108 mm length are inserted between the central rows of cells in model-5. In addition, all features of model-4 are included in model-5. Gap of 12 mm is maintained between two consecutive tubes. The tubes have a rectangular outer cross-sectional area of 10 mm × 3 mm and a wall thickness of 0.5 mm. Due to the large cross-sectional area of the tubes, a large amount of air flow takes place through the tubes, which enhances the heat transfer from the cells in the central region of the BP. Inclusion of the aluminium tubes in the BTMS reduces the Tmax of the BP to 34.1 °C in case of 2C discharge rate and 40.6 °C in case of 4C discharge rate (Fig. 8). In fact, overall heat transfer from the BP is improved in model-5 compared to model-4. As a result, the minimum temperature is also reduced in model-5 than model-4, which causes the ΔT to reduce considerably in model-5 compared model-4 for both 2C and 4C rates.

For further improvement of temperature distribution in the cells, a secondary air inlet is placed at the bottom of the BP in model-6. Additional air is injected through this secondary inlet, which is situated at the central region of the bottom surface of the BP. Diameter of the secondary inlet is 50 mm. Velocity of air through the secondary inlet is considered to be 0.85 m/s, which is determined by considering the same flow rate of air through both inlets. Additional airflow through the secondary air inlet enhances the convective cooling of the BP. As a consequence, the Tmax and the ΔT of the BP are reduced to 32.2 °C and 1.4 °C, respectively for 2C rate and 38.7 °C and 3.6 °C, respectively for 4C rate (Fig. 9). These values of the Tmax and the ΔT in the BP show significant improvement of the cooling performance obtained with model-6 compared to model-1 (no air cooling) and model-2 (conventional forced air cooling). Although the inlet air velocity remains constant in models 2 to 6, the temperature variation mainly depends upon the design of the flow path and the conductive elements used in models 2 to 6. The inclusion of aluminum strips, plates, and tubes in the proposed BTMS enhances heat conduction between cells, enabling the heat generated by central cells to spread toward the inlet and cooler peripheral regions. This conduction-assisted heat spreading improves overall temperature uniformity even under constant airflow conditions.

Integration of tubes reduced flow resistance, which increased the air velocity in the central region of BP. Due to these temperatures of the cells in the central rows are found to be considerably lower than the cells near the wall of the BP.
3.1. Physical interpretation for pressure drop, air velocity, and temperature
Distributions of pressure and velocity inside the BTMS are crucial, as they directly affect heat transfer and the resulting temperature distribution. Fig. 10 shows the contours of pressure and velocity of model-2 and model-6 at 4C-rate.

Fig. 10. Pressure (Pa) and Velocity (m/s) distribution in model-2 and model-6 at 4C rate.

These contours are observed on a plane, which is at the middle of the height of the cells. Contour diagrams of the pressure and velocity distribution in other models and C-rate are not presented here to maintain brevity. Fig. 10 shows that as the air-flow passes through the narrow gaps between the cells, the area of flow first reduces rapidly and then expands rapidly. This phenomenon is repeated in all rows of cells from the inlet to the outlet. As a result of this successive rapid increase and decrease of the flow-area, there is a large resistance to the flow, which causes a significant reduction of pressure between the inlet and the outlet (15.1 Pa). In model-2, where conventional forced air-cooling takes place, a large pressure drop occurs after the first row of cells. As a result, maximum air velocity of 2.12 m/s is observed in the gaps between the cells in the first row. Pressure drop in the following rows of cells is more gradual. Therefore, velocity of air remains relatively low in these rows. This kind of velocity distribution causes significant heat dissipation from the first few rows of cells. However, cooling power of air is reduced in the subsequent cell-rows. Therefore, temperature of the cells near the outlet are much hotter compared to the cells near the inlet, as seen in Fig. 5.
In model-3, aluminium strips are inserted between the cells along the airflow direction. These strips reduce the area of flow and increase the resistance to flow. As a result, larger pressure drop of 23.6 Pa is observed in model-3. Maximum velocity of air also increases to 2.64 m/s. Subsequently, heat transfer from the cells improves and lower cell-temperatures are observed in model-3, as found in Fig. 6. In model-4, aluminium plates are placed at the top and at the bottom of the cells. This arrangement does not affect the area of airflow vis-à-vis model-3. Therefore, pressure drop and velocity in model-4 are very close to the same obtained with model-3. Improvement of temperature distribution in model-4 (Fig. 7) compared to model-3 is due to the additional conductive heat transfer through the aluminium plates.
In model-5 aluminium tubes are installed along the airflow direction between the cells in the central rows. Resistance to the airflow through the tube is very low compared to the flow resistance in the other locations of the domain. Therefore, major amount of airflow takes place through the tubes, thereby increasing the velocity of air through the tubes up to 4.03 m/s. However, in other parts of the domain air velocity is very low. Pressure drop of 43.4 Pa is observed in model-5. As a result of the high-velocity airflow through the tubes, the heat dissipation from the cells in the central region of the BP improves and the temperature of the cells in this region decreases (Fig. 8).
In model-6 a secondary inlet of 50 mm diameter is placed at the bottom of the BP, through which air enters with 0.85 m/s velocity. This additional airflow in the BP increases the pressure drop between the primary inlet and the outlet to 85.3 Pa. Also, convective heat transfer from the cells improves due to this secondary airflow, which reduces the temperature of the BP. Part of the secondary airflow passes through the tubes also and increases the maximum velocity of air through the tubes to 7.18 m/s, which enhances the heat transfer from the central region of the BP and reduce the temperature of this zone further, as observed in Fig. 9.
Variation of the temperature of the cells with time reveals how fast the temperature change occurs in the BP. In order to track the temporal variation of temperature, three number of cells are identified and indexed in Fig. 11. Cell-1 is close to the inlet, cell-2 is at the middle of the pack, and cell-3 is close to the outlet.

Fig. 11. Locations of identified cells in BTMS (Inlet on the left side, outlet on the right side).

Variation of temperature of the identified cells with time for different models at 4C rate are presented in Fig. 12. In model-1, where no air-cooling is provided, temperature in all cells increases rapidly almost up to the end of the discharge period. With force air cooling in model-2, T1 increases very much slower compared to T2 and T3. (T2 – T1) is significantly greater than (T3 – T2) throughout the discharge period. After ∼0.16 h of time (∼65 % state of charge), T1 becomes almost constant, but T2 and T3 continues to increase, although somewhat slowly. In model-3 the difference between (T2 – T1) and (T3 – T2) decreases, which indicates better uniformity of temperature in the BP throughout the discharge cycle. The uniformity of temperature is found to improve further in model-4. Also, T1, T2, and T3 are found to become almost constant after ∼0.16 h, which indicates that the heat dissipation from the BP is almost same as the heat generation in the cells. In model-5 and model-6 T1, T2, and T3 are found to decrease marginally after ∼0.16 h, which clearly shows more efficient heat dissipation in these models. Uniformity of temperature is also improved in these two models. Best uniformity of temperature and minimum peak temperature is obtained with model-6. Temperature vs time plots for these models at 2C rate (not presented in this paper for briefness) reveal that T1, T2, and T3 start decreasing after ∼0.3 h (∼60 % state of charge) due to smaller rate of heat generation at 2C compared to 4C rate. Reduction of temperature after ∼60 % state of charge is particularly significant with model-5 and model-6.

Various performance metrics of BTMS, viz. mass of the model, volume utilization, energy density, power consumption are presented in Table 3. It shows that mass of the model increases gradually when the aluminium strips, plates, and tubes are gradually incorporated in the BTMS. However, after including all of these additional components in model-5 and model-6, mass of the model is increased by ∼100 gm (∼6.5 %) only. Considering the cost of aluminium to be $3 per kg, material cost of the aluminium parts is $0.3 only. Fabrication of the aluminium parts involves only cutting of these parts as per appropriate dimensions, which is very inexpensive. Therefore, increase of overall cost of the BP should be within $2 per kWh for mass production. This small additional weight and cost of BTMS can significantly improve the cooling performance, as observed in earlier discussions in this paper. Volume utilization, i.e. the ratio of total volume of cells to total volume of the BP is found to be very good, because only 1 mm gap between the cells is provided. Volume utilization is found to be little lower in model-5 and model-6, because volume of these two models are little increased for maintaining 3 mm gap between the cells in the central row to accommodate the tubes. Energy density of the BP, i.e. the ratio of the energy storage capacity of the BP to the mass of the BTMS model is found to decrease to some extent (maximum 6 %) in the BTMS models due the mass of the additional components. Power consumption of the BTMS is found to increase significantly from model-2 to model-6. This is because, addition of the strips, plates, and tubes increase the resistance to the airflow and produces large pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the BMS model, as discussed earlier in this paper. This power consumption should be low to reduce the wastage of the stored energy of the BP. Maximum power consumption takes place in model-6. Although the power consumption of Model-6 is slightly higher, it accounts for only 0.055 % of the total BP capacity, which is negligible. Based on the performance index (Φ), Model-4 appears to be the most efficient design; however, it performs poorly in terms of Tmax and temperature uniformity, which are critical parameters for battery safety and reliability. Moreover, Model-4 is less favourable with respect to volumetric utilization and energy density. In contrast, Model-6 is the only configuration that achieves a maximum temperature (Tmax) and temperature difference (ΔT) clearly within the optimal design range, while also offering a marginally higher volumetric utilization and energy density compared to Model-4.

Model-6	1702	60.47	304.58	0.28	3.6288
Considering the combined aspects of thermal performance, energy density, and structural efficiency, Model-6 provides a more effective and balanced design, offering superior thermal control with minimal energy penalty.
4. Comparison with different variants of forced air-cooling system
Conventional forced air-cooling type BTMS, represented by model 2 in this study, has been found to be ineffective in a large number of studies. In view of this, many researchers proposed different types of BTMS configurations by varying the inlet and outlet positions in order to appropriately distribute the cooling air and effectively utilize the cooling power of air. Various configurations, such as U-type [57], Z-type [58], J-type [58], T-type [59], X-type [60], etc., were studied by the researchers for different types and numbers of cells, C-rates, and other design and operating parameters. Another important method used by the researchers to improve BTMS performance is by attaching fins on the cells [53].
In this study, CFD simulations of U-type, Z-type, T-type, and longitudinal fin-type BTMS are conducted for the same BP size and operating conditions as the novel BTMS and the results of these simulations are used to benchmark the performance of the novel BTMS. Schematic diagrams of U-type, Z-type, T-type, and longitudinal fin-type BTMS are shown in Fig. 13. The U-type, Z-type, and T-type BTMS are same as the BTMS shown in Fig. 1 in terms of length, width, number and type of cells, and spacing between the cells. However, 10 mm of space is maintained both above and below the cells in U, Z, and T-type BTMS for smooth entrance and exit of the air in the BP and for ease of flow through the gap between the cells, as observed in the literature. Therefore, height of U, Z, and T-type BTMS are 20 mm more than the BTMS in Fig. 1. In the fin-type BTMS, 4 number of longitudinal fins of aluminium are attached on each cell. The fins are of 1 mm thickness and 1 mm height. Length of the fins are same as the length of the cells. Gap between the cells are increased by 2 mm in both longitudinal and transverse directions to accommodate the fins in the BTMS. Therefore, the fin-type BTMS is 12 mm longer and 12 mm wider than the BTMS shown in Fig. 1.

Temperature distribution in U-type BTMS at 2C and 4C-rates is presented in Fig. 14. Cold air enters the BTMS through the inlet at the bottom-left side and moves straight through the gap between the bottom of cells and the bottom wall of the BP. During this period the air remains coolest, which keeps the temperature at the bottom of the cells remains low irrespective of C-rate. Then the air moves through the gap between the cells in the upward direction, during which it absorbs heat from the cells and becomes hot. When the hot air reaches at the space between the top of the cells and the top wall of the BP, it moves towards the left and finally comes out through the outlet at the top-left side. Tmax of 34.9 °C at 2C-rate and 41.9 °C at 4C-rate are observed in the U-type BTMS. Cells near the walls of the BP are found to be cooler due to natural convection heat transfer from the walls. Cells at the central region are hotter due to inadequate heat removal by the cooling air from these cells. ΔT is found to be 1.5 °C and 3.7 °C, respectively at 2C and 4C-rates, which is within the optimum ΔT of 5 °C. Therefore, the U-type BTMS is found to have significantly inferior cooling performance than the novel BTMS presented in this work.

In the Z-type BTMS the incoming cold air primarily moves in the upward direction than in the horizontal direction through the gap between the bottom of cells and the bottom wall of the BP. Consequently, cells near the inlet are found to be the coolest and the cells in the subsequent rows become hotter. The hottest cells are found at one row before the outlet. Cells near the outlet become slightly cooler due to natural convection heat transfer at the wall. The Tmax in the Z-type BTMS is found to be ∼3 °C more than that in the U-type BTMS, as seen in Fig. 15. ΔT is observed as 4.9 °C and 8.5 °C at 2C and 4C-rates. Inferior performance of Z-type BTMS can be attributed to improper distribution of cooling air due to the airflow pattern.

Fig. 15. Temperature distribution in Z-type BTMS at 2C and 4C-rates.

In the T-type BTMS the inlet and the outlets form a T-shape. Due to this configuration, the incoming cold air primarily moves in the upward direction through the central rows. As a result, temperatures in the central rows of cells are much lower than the other cells in the pack. The hottest cells are in the rows, which are immediately after the central rows. The Tmax is found to be 36.3 °C and 42.9 °C at 2C and 4C-rates, while ΔT of 3.1 °C and 4.5 °C at the corresponding C-rates, as seen in Fig. 16. Therefore, performance of T-type BTMS is in between that of U-type and Z-type BTMS. It may be noted that the cooling performances of U, Z, and T-type BTMS are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16 are obtained by taking same BP configuration and operating conditions as used in case of the novel BTMS. However, it can be improved by increasing the gap between the cells and the airflow rate, as observed in the literature. However, doing so will decrease the volume of the BP and increase the power consumption significantly.

Temperature distribution in the fin-type BTMS is shown in Fig. 17. Here, the cell temperature is observed to gradually rise from the inlet to the outlet due to the gradual loss of cooling power of incoming cold air. In this case the Tmax is found to be almost same as that observed in Z-type BTMS. However, ΔT is observed to be 7.2 °C and 10.4 °C at 2C and 4C-rates, which is very high. Therefore, fins are not found to improve the BTMS performance. It may be noted that cooling performance in fin-type BTMS can be improved by increasing the thickness and height of the fins, as observed by Alzwayi and Paul [52]. However, it will increase volume and weight of the BP significantly.

Table 4 provides a summary of the cooling performance of various commonly used air-cooled BTMS vis-à-vis model-6 of the novel BTMS The Tmax in novel BTMS is found to be lower by 3.2 °C, 6 °C, 4.2 °C, and 6 °C compared to U-type, Z-type, T-type, and fin-type BTMS, respectively at 4C-rate. At 2C-rate also, the novel BTMS shows better performance than the rest. In terms of temperature difference, only the U-type BTMS is close to the novel BTMS, but with a much lower volumetric energy density. Tmax and ΔT in all other BTMS is much higher than the novel BTMS. This table clearly highlights the significantly superior performance of the BTMS developed in this study.

5. Conclusion
A novel air-cooled BTMS is presented in this paper to address four critical issues of the conventional natural air-cooling or forced air-cooling systems: high temperature of the cells, non-uniform temperature distribution across the cells, elevated temperature at the terminals of the cells, and difficulty of heat removal from the central region of the BP. Strips, plates, and tubes of aluminium are introduced in this novel BTMS in a step-by-step manner to address these problems by enhancing the conductive heat transfer. Three-dimensional CFD simulations are performed with six different models of the BTMS at 2C and 4C discharge rates to understand the effects of including the additional elements on the thermal performance of the BTMS. The study leads to the following conclusions.
i.
In the natural air-cooling system, where only the outer wall of the BP is cooled by the ambient air through buoyancy-driven convection. Due to the low convective heat transfer coefficient of natural convection and the absence of internal conduction elements, the heat generated in the central region accumulated, leading to a Tmax of 49.5 °C and a ΔT of 5.9 °C at 4C. Even at 2C, the Tmax remained high (43.7 °C) with a 6.5 °C temperature difference, indicating uneven heat dissipation.
ii.
By using the conventional forced air-cooling system, Tmax of the BP comes down to 44.9 °C, however ΔT increases significantly to 9.2 °C at 4C-rate. The cold air stream effectively cooled the local region near the inlets, but the central cells remained poorly cooled due to non-uniform heat distribution and insufficient conductive heat transfer pathways. These values clearly show that the natural air-cooling system and the forced air-cooling system cannot cool the BP sufficiently at high C-rates.
iii.
Including the aluminium strips, plates and tubes significantly improve the temperature distribution in the BP models 3–5. In these models the convective cooling by the airflow is appropriately complemented by the conductive heat transfer through these additional elements. The incorporation of tubes not only served as conductive channels but also reduced flow resistance, which increased the air velocity in the central region of BP. Due to this increased the temperature uniformity and reduced the heat accumulation in the central region of the BP.
iv.
Best temperature distribution is obtained with model-6, where an additional air-inlet is arranged along with the aluminium strips, plates and tubes. Tmax and ΔT in this model at 2C-rate are 32.2 °C and 1.4 °C only. At 4C-rate, the corresponding values are 38.7 °C and 3.6 °C, respectively.
v.
This study shows that including some simple elements of aluminium in the novel BTMS increases the weight of the BP by merely 100 gm (∼6.5 %) and cost by about $2 per kWh only. Also, there is some minor amount of energy consumption by the cooling fan. However, the novel BTMS can reduce the peak temperature by 22 % and ΔT by 39 % compared to the natural air-cooling systems at 4C-rate. In comparison to the forced air-cooling system, the novel BTMS reduces the peak temperature and ΔT by 14 % and 61 %, respectively. This improvement reveal that physical advantage, the addition of high-conductivity aluminium components with enhanced convective flow pathways.
vi.
Cooling performance of the novel BTMS is found to be significantly superior to the performance of the common variants of forced air cooling BTMS. The Tmax in model-6 of the novel BTMS is found to be lower by 3.2 °C, 6 °C, 4.2 °C, and 6 °C compared to U-type, Z-type, T-type, and fin-type BTMS, respectively at 4C-rate. In terms of temperature difference, only the U-type BTMS is close to the novel BTMS. The ΔT in all other BTMS is much higher than that of the novel BTMS.
vii.
Battery model-6 exhibits a slightly lower volumetric energy density than the other proposed configurations (Model-1 to 4); however, it achieves superior thermal uniformity and lower maximum temperature. In contrast, the conventional U, Z, T-type, and fin-type BTMS designs exhibit lower volumetric energy density, along with higher temperatures and poor temperature uniformity, highlighting the balanced thermal–structural advantage of the proposed model.
6. Limitations, advantages, and future directions
Although the present study provides quantitative insights, it is essential to acknowledge the inherent limitations and potential variability associated with the results. The simulations were conducted under steady airflow and idealized boundary conditions, which may differ from real operating scenarios. The grid independence test minimized numerical uncertainty; a small margin of error may still exist due to mesh discretization and modelling simplifications. The advantages, limitations, and future directions of the present work are summarized below.
6.1. Advantages
i.
The proposed synergistic conduction–convection BTMS efficiently integrates aluminum strips, plates, and tubes to enhance both conductive and convective heat transfer, functioning as fins, but temperature is distributed uniformly rather than localized.
ii.
It achieves superior temperature uniformity and reduces peak temperature significantly compared with conventional air-cooling systems (STBP, U-type, Z-type, T-type, and fin-type BTMS).
iii.
The proposed design has higher energy density, high volumetric utilization, while being simple, cost-effective, and easy to manufacture.
iv.
The Performance Index (Φ) combines temperature uniformity with fan power consumption. Lower value of Φ shows superior thermo-hydraulic performance of the BTMS.
6.2. Limitations
i.
The analysis assumes steady and uniform airflow, which may differ from real driving conditions where airflow fluctuates.
ii.
Air-cooled BTMS becomes ineffective under very high ambient temperatures due to the low thermal conductivity of air.
iii.
Effect of the thickness of thermal interface material (TIM) not considered.
iv.
Structural optimization of conductive elements was not explored in this study
6.3. Future work
i.
Extend the model to include dynamic, non-uniform airflow and transient environmental conditions.
ii.
Investigate multi-parameter optimization of conductive component geometry and material for maximum efficiency.
iii.
The effect of different cell spacing will be explored, and a BP model will be simulated for high ambient temperature.
