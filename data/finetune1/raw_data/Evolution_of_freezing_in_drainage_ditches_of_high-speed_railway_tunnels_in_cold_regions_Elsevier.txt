1. Introduction
Cold regions are distributed extensively across the globe. As infrastructure development continues to advance in these harsh environments, the number of tunnels constructed in cold regions is steadily increasing (Gong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2022). Significant diurnal and seasonal temperature variations prevalent in these areas lead to recurrent frost damage within tunnels, posing a significant engineering challenge (Zhang et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2025). Ensuring effective drainage is universally recognized as the core factor for preventing such frost damage (Gao et al., 2018). Among the most common manifestations of this problem is the freezing of tunnel drainage systems, particularly drainage ditches. This phenomenon is frequently observed in cold-region tunnels worldwide (Xu et al., 2025), documented in cases such as the Jituhun High-Speed Railway Tunnel (Tian et al., 2022), the Qidaoliang Tunnel (Qiao et al., 2012), the Caomugou Tunnel (Ding et al., 2022), and the Nordland County tunnels (Aursand, 2013), among others. Drainage ditch freezing causes failure of the tunnel drainage system, triggering a series of frost damage problems and significantly threatening tunnel operation safety. Current mitigation measures predominantly rely on manual removal techniques such as chiseling; their use is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also incurs high operational costs.
The temperature field within cold-region tunnels is a key factor for frost damage prevention and mitigation, and serves as an important parameter for ensuring long-term structural integrity and operational safety (Zhang et al., 2024b). Understanding the spatial distribution of temperature is paramount, as research has demonstrated that the annual average temperature and the annual temperature amplitude within tunnel lining structures undergo predictable, approximately linear changes with radial distance from the lining surface (Zhao et al., 2023). This linear variation pattern provides a critical theoretical basis for assessing thermal stress and potential freeze-thaw cycles within the lining material. Notably, the ambient conditions at the tunnel portal exert significant control over the internal temperature field. The air temperature entering the tunnel serves as a primary determinant of the overall distribution pattern of the internal temperature field (Xu et al., 2024). Wind speed at the tunnel portal most significantly affects the longitudinal temperature profile, and this effect is dominant in cold regions (Ma et al., 2025). The dynamic interplay between portal air temperature and wind speed necessitates sophisticated modeling. Theoretical solutions for the temperature field have been developed (Yuan et al., 2022), given that traffic-induced wind exerts a substantial impact on the internal temperature field — an effect with direct design implications. Accordingly, differential thermal protection strategies are necessary, leading to asymmetric insulation layer configurations. This asymmetry aligns with both the predominant traffic flow direction and the dominant wind direction at the tunnel portal. This alignment optimizes thermal insulation performance in critical zones (Jiang et al., 2023). Based on the above analysis, the anti-freeze design of drainage ditches in cold-region tunnels must be grounded in the tunnel temperature field, with targeted insulation and anti-freeze measures implemented in sections identified as critical and prone to freezing.
In terms of drainage system design, different drainage methods are adopted for various temperature zones along the tunnel (Qiao et al., 2024). Based on the relationship between the tunnel internal temperature and surrounding rock temperature, the structural configuration of the drainage system can be categorized into three types: non-insulated drainage ditches, insulated central drainage ditches, and deeply buried central drainage ditches (Wang et al., 2023). The primary drainage structures include drainage galleries, supplemented by insulated anti-freezing drainage galleries, deeply buried central drainage ditches, and ditches equipped with heat tracing cables (Wang et al., 2017). To optimize drainage performance, the design parameters (including pipe diameter) of drainage ditches are tailored to the climatic and geological conditions of the tunnel (Xia et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2023). Furthermore, the burial depth of drainage ditches significantly influences their internal temperature variation (Zhang et al., 2023). The appropriate depth can be determined based on the relationship between the deepest freezing depth in the coldest month and the thermal diffusion coefficient of the local area (Sun et al., 2017).
In terms of thermal insulation, applying insulation measures to drainage ditches in combination with electric heat tracing systems has become a primary anti-freezing strategy for tunnels in cold regions (Cui et al., 2021a; Ma et al., 2023). This is due to the fact that the heat generated by heat tracing cables can prevent freezing in tunnel drainage ditches and also be used to thaw already frozen drainage sections (Li, 2021). In high-altitude regions with significant geothermal activity, air-source heat pumps are used for heating (Wang et al., 2022a), while ground-source heat pump systems are used in extremely high-altitude cold regions (Zhang et al., 2012). These methods offer safer and more reliable performance compared to traditional heating approaches. Additionally, air curtain insulation at tunnel portals can be applied to prevent frost damage in these critical sections (Wang et al., 2022b). When implementing insulation measures, the selection of insulation materials requires comprehensive consideration of various influencing factors (Jia et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2021b). Moreover, the installation position and length of the insulation layer must account for environmental, geological, hydrological, and climatic conditions (Zhou et al., 2023). Meanwhile, increasing the thickness of the insulation layer and adopting materials with lower thermal conductivity can enhance the frost resistance and anti-freezing effectiveness of tunnel linings (Li et al., 2020). The thickness of the insulation layer can be calculated using an equivalent thickness conversion method, and this calculation is combined with a formula derived from studies on the movement patterns of the freezing front (Yu et al., 2022).
While significant progress has been made in existing research regarding macroscopic temperature field simulations of tunnels, structural configurations of drainage systems, and insulation measures, most studies have focused on the temperature fields of lining structures or surrounding rock, with insufficient attention paid to the temperature distribution characteristics of drainage ditch walls—the critical interface for water-thermal exchange. Simultaneously, research on the heat transfer mechanisms of flowing water within the ditches remains inadequate, leading to an unclear understanding of the freezing process in drainage systems. This gap in fundamental research has resulted in current anti-freezing measures often relying on empirical approaches, lacking precise theoretical guidance, which limits their effectiveness and leads to a passive response mode. Therefore, this study aims to systematically investigate the freezing mechanisms in drainage ditches of cold-region tunnels through an integrated methodology combining field monitoring, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis. Specifically, this study measured the longitudinal temperature distributions in the Hufengling Tunnel and Zhishan Tunnel, employed ANSYS numerical simulation to analyze the temperature distribution patterns on drainage ditch walls, and established a coupled flow-heat transfer model for water in drainage ditches through theoretical analysis to reveal the freezing evolution mechanism. Based on the ditch wall temperature and water freezing mechanisms, sections prone to freezing were predicted, enriching the macroscopic theory of tunnel frost damage prevention and providing effective guidance for tunnel engineers to address drainage ditch frost damage.
2. Longitudinal temperature distribution of tunnel
The Hufengling and Zhishan Tunnels, located in the highest-altitude section of the Harbin-Mudanjiang high-speed rail line, were selected for temperature field monitoring. Fig. 1 illustrates the locations of the tunnels and the installation of the monitoring equipment. The Hufengling Tunnel is located in the Xiao Xing'an Ling area of Northeast China's Linhai Snowfield. With a total length of 8755 m, it is the longest high-speed railway tunnel in China's severely cold regions and has a maximum burial depth of approximately 275 m. The Zhishan Tunnel is 2555 m long with a maximum burial depth of approximately 152 m. Both are single-bore, double-track tunnels with a three-centered circular arch cross section, featuring an upper half arc radius of 6.41 m. A six-month field monitoring study was conducted to investigate the temperature fields within these tunnels. In the Hufengling Tunnel, we installed 22 monitoring cross sections along the main tunnel and two additional cross sections in the No. 2 inclined shaft. One located at the mid-point of the inclined shaft, and the other approximately 10 m from the main tunnel. The temperature at the mid-point of the inclined shaft can be approximately regarded as the ground temperature.A total of nine monitoring cross-sections were established along the Zhishan Tunnel. The spatial distribution and detailed layout of these sections are presented in Fig. 2. The temperature sensors used were RC-5+ temperature loggers, which feature a built-in automatic sleep-wake system. These data loggers recorded temperatures at preset intervals, adjustable from 10 s to 24 h, with a measurement accuracy of ±0.5 °C within the range of - 20 °C to 40 °C and a resolution of 0.1 °C. Powered by an integrated low-temperature lithium battery, each unit can operate continuously for up to six months in environments from - 40 °C to 70 °C. The compact dimensions of the loggers (75 mm × 33 mm × 13 mm) facilitated installation on the secondary lining surface. All sensors were secured directly to the lining at a height of 3 m above the inspection walkway. On-site data collection was conducted at hourly intervals to capture short-term temperature fluctuations.

Fig. 3(a) illustrates the monthly average temperature distribution at all monitoring sections in the Hufengling Tunnel. From December to February, the monthly average temperatures increase with distance from the tunnel portal. From March to May, the monthly average temperature rises rapidly within 100 m of the tunnel entrance. Temperatures in the middle tunnel section s was relatively stable. From December to April, monthly average temperatures at the Hufengling Tunnel entrance were below 0 °C. The activation of the inclined shaft resulted in a sharp temperature increase in the monitoring section between 5000 and 6000 m. Fig. 3(b) illustrates the monthly average temperature distribution at all monitoring sections in the Zhishan Tunnel. Temperatures exhibited symmetric longitudinal distribution and increased with distance from the tunnel portal. From December to April, all monthly average temperatures remained below 0 °C. As the climate warms, the differences in monthly average temperature between tunnel sections decrease progressively.

3. Temperature field of tunnel drainage ditch wall in cold region
3.1. Numerical simulation
In the Hufengling Tunnel, a deeply buried central drainage ditch was constructed within 1 km of the tunnel entrance, with a thermal insulation central drainage ditch used in the remaining sections. The Zhishan Tunnel incorporated a deeply buried central drainage ditch along its entire length; both tunnels also featured the same thermal insulation side drainage ditch. The upper portion of the deeply buried central drainage ditch consisted of thermal insulation concrete, and a 50 cm thick polyurethane insulation board was installed beneath the concrete cover plates of both the central inspection well and the tunnel thermal insulation side drainage ditch. The distance from the bottom of the thermal insulation central drainage ditch in both tunnels to the top of the internal rail measured 2150 mm, and the deeply buried central drainage ditch to the top of the internal rail was 4080 mm.
Inside the drainage ditches of high-speed railway tunnels in cold regions, the heat transfer process of flowing water is governed by thermal exchange with both the ditch walls and the overlying air. The actual heat transfer system is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. A three-dimensional convective heat transfer finite element model was established using ANSYS software. The model simulated tunnels in cold regions under anhydrous conditions, featuring two configurations: a thermal insulation center drainage ditch and a thermal insulation side drainage ditch, and a deep buried center drainage ditch and a thermal insulation side drainage ditch The model had a width of 50 m and a height of 20 m, with the cross section located below the springing line of the tunnel. The calculation model consisted of a 20 cm primary support, a 5 cm thermal insulation layer, a 45 cm secondary lining, and a surrounding rock that was three times the diameter of the tunnel. A structured grid meshing was utilized, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Based on the temperature field of the tunnel and the temperature monitoring data from two sections within the inclined shaft, the ground temperature was determined to be approximately 6.5 °C. Accordingly, a constant temperature boundary condition of 6.5 °C was set for the region within three times the tunnel diameter, and the arch line was defined as an adiabatic boundary. Convective heat transfer boundaries were applied to the tunnel lining surface, track slab top, maintenance pavement, drainage ditch top, and track slab sides.

In previous studies, annual sinusoidal functions have been widely adopted to represent temperature variations in tunnels and have been utilized as thermal loads or boundary conditions in both model experiments and numerical simulations. For instance, simulations of the temperature field in the Hongfu Tunnel (Wu et al., 2017) and the Galongla Tunnel (Tan et al., 2014) employed a thermal load function of the form given in Eq. (1).
(1)
These studies commonly employ an annual sinusoidal function to describe the temperature variation at specific tunnel cross-sections. However, continuous field measurements of the temperature field reveal that diurnal fluctuations caused by day-night cycles are both significant and ubiquitous. The use of an annual periodic trigonometric function to represent internal and external tunnel air temperatures overlooks the characteristics of these short-term daily variations. Therefore, a function accurately representing temperature variations at the tunnel portal should incorporate both the annual cycle and the short-term fluctuations induced by diurnal alternation (Wu et al., 2020):
(2)
t is time, h. Tmc is composite mean temperature, °C. Ta is the annual temperature fluctuation amplitude. Given that the amplitude of short-term temperature fluctuations at the tunnel portal during winter varies with ambient air temperature, it is recommended that when utilizing this expression, the amplitude of such short-term fluctuations (Tb) be adopted as the average value calculated over the entire cold season. The temperature data from each monitoring cross-section in the two tunnels were fitted using this formula, and the following results were finally obtained:
(3)
T is temperature, °C; t is time, h.
Therefore, the temperature boundary conditions in the tunnel consider the influence of short-term temperature fluctuations. The temperature function was applied as a time-varying environmental temperature to the temperature boundary condition. The implementation of the temperature boundary condition, which followed Eq. (3), was carried out through the following specific steps in ANSYS: Within the Parameters menu, the Function utility was selected, followed by Define/Edit to define Eq. (3). Subsequently, the function was loaded by selecting Read from file.
According to the physical characteristics of common cold region high speed railway tunnel structure, Table 1 shows the physical properties employed in materials of numerical simulations(Wu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2024; Qiao et al., 2025;).

A grid independence verification was conducted for the model. We constructed a mesh comprising approximately 110,000 elements and selected the monthly minimum temperature at monitoring point A, located on the wall of the insulated side ditch near the tunnel entrance section, as the evaluation metric. This metric was chosen for its direct relevance to the paper's core conclusions. The evaluation results are presented in Table 2. When the number of elements was increased from 110,000 (Scheme 3) to 220,000 (Scheme 4), the change in the key metric was less than 1 %, meeting the commonly adopted engineering accuracy criterion of <2 %. Therefore, the results obtained using the 110,000-element mesh from Scheme 3 are considered grid-independent.

Monthly Minimum Temperature at Monitoring Point A /°C	−5.23	−4.95	−4.81	−4.79
Relative Change Rate	Benchmark	5.35 %	2.83 %	0.42 %
Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed for two key parameters: the boundary temperature and the convective heat transfer coefficient, using the same evaluation metric as for the grid independence verification. The baseline value for the boundary temperature was set at 6.5 °C, with a variation range of ±1 °C (i.e., 5.5 °C, 6.5 °C, and 7.5 °C). The baseline value for the convective heat transfer coefficient was 4.2 W/(m2·°C−1), with a variation range of ±1 W/(m2·°C−1) (i.e., 3.2 W/(m2·°C−1), 4.2 W/(m2·°C−1), and 5.2 W/(m2·°C−1). The sensitivity analysis results for the boundary temperature indicated that for every 1 °C increase in the rock mass temperature, the minimum temperature at monitoring point A increased by approximately 0.1–0.2 °C. This represents a low sensitivity, suggesting that the model results are not highly dependent on the precise value of the initial ground temperature and validating the use of the measured value of 6.5 °C. Additionally, when the boundary location was extended from 3 times the tunnel diameter to 4 times the diameter, the temperature change at monitoring point A was less than 0.1 °C, demonstrating that a boundary set at 3 times the diameter is sufficiently distant. The sensitivity analysis for the convective heat transfer coefficient indicated a limited influence of this parameter on the results. A variation in the hf value resulted in a temperature change at monitoring point A of less than 0.2 °C, which falls within the acceptable margin of error for this study. Therefore, the convective heat transfer coefficient can be considered an insensitive parameter in this analysis.
3.2. The temperature distribution law
3.2.1. Temperature field of the drainage ditch wall surface at the entrance section
According to the numerical simulation results, the temperature distribution on the drainage ditch wall at the tunnel entrance section was analyzed. The first day of each month during the cold season was selected for analysis, as January 1 corresponds to the period of minimum temperature.
Fig. 6 illustrates the temperature curves of the tunnel thermal insulation side drainage ditch at various times. The temperature drop within the tunnel induced subzero temperatures in the entrance zone and beneath the maintenance access cover slab. The 0 °C isotherm gradually descended. Although the tunnel temperature increased by March 1, the freezing depth at this time was greater than that at the time of minimum temperature. The temperature of maintenance access cover slab remained negative at a depth range of 1 to 3 m. Throughout the winter, the temperature decreased rapidly at a depth range of 0.3 m, and the temperature amplitude at the bottom of the thermal insulation side drainage ditch was −7 °C to 7 °C.

3.2.2. Short-term fluctuations in drainage ditch wall temperature
Fig. 9(a) illustrates the daily temperature variation at different depths below the cover plate of the thermal insulation side drainage ditch. Short-term temperature fluctuations were evident from the top surface of the drainage ditch cover plate to a thickness of 0.06 m. Upon reaching the polyurethane thermal insulation layer, the temperature fluctuations decreased significantly, accompanied by a notable phase difference between the temperature fluctuations peak and the cover plate surface. The fluctuations disappeared at the bottom of the layer. Fig. 9(b) illustrates the daily temperature variation at different depths below the cover plate of the central drainage ditch of the tunnel. Short-term temperature fluctuations were more pronounced at the top surface of the cover plate and decreased significantly upon reaching the thermal insulation concrete layer, with a notable and continuously increasing phase difference between the peak value and the surface of the cover plate. At a depth of 0.54 m, these fluctuations were largely eliminated.

3.2.3. Location of the freezing front in the drainage ditch
Fig. 10(a) illustrates the location of the 0 °C isotherm for the deep buried central water ditch at the tunnel portal. The 0 °C isotherm continuously moves downward as the air temperature decreases. The maximum freezing depth extends below the bottom of the drainage ditch. As the air temperature gradually rises, two 0 °C isotherms appear in the drainage ditch area. Due to geothermal effects, the deeper 0 °C isotherm gradually moves upward. Due to rising ambient air temperatures, the shallower 0 °C isotherm moves downward. Eventually, the upper portion of the central drainage ditch completely thaws. During the coldest season, the wall temperature of the deep buried central water ditch in the tunnel remains above 0 °C, no freezing.

After the air temperature rises, the temperature variation pattern is consistent with that described above. The wall temperature of the insulated side ditch in the tunnel drops to negative values during winter, resulting in freezing.
Fig. 10(c) illustrates the location of the 0 °C isotherm for the insulated central water ditch in the tunnel. The maximum freezing depth exceeds the bottom elevation of the drainage ditch. After the air temperature rises, the temperature variation pattern is consistent with that described above. In the coldest season, the wall temperature of the insulated center ditch in the tunnel drops to negative values, resulting in freezing.
3.3. Longitudinal distribution of wall temperature
In this study, the temperature threshold corresponding to the minimum value of Eq. (3) was defined as the extreme low-temperature condition. Based on this condition, the longitudinal temperature distribution along the drainage channel wall was calculated. Furthermore, assuming that the drainage channel enters a frozen state when its wall temperature reaches −1 °C, numerical simulations were conducted for each monitoring section to analyze the freezing depth under such extreme low temperatures. Ultimately, the sections of the tunnel drainage channel prone to freezing were identified based on the results.
3.3.1. Longitudinal distribution of wall temperature of drainage ditches
Fig. 11 illustrates the longitudinal temperature distribution on the wall surface of the tunnel drainage ditch under extreme low temperature conditions. Under extreme low temperature conditions, the side drainage ditch wall temperature in the Hufengling Tunnel has always been below 0 °C, showing a trend of first increasing and then sharply decreasing with the distance from the entrance. At 1000 m from the entrance, the wall temperature decreased sharply due to the reduced embedment depth of the central drainage ditch. The wall temperature remained below 0 °C in the range of 1000 to 3000 m from the entrance [Fig. 11(a)]. The thermal insulation side drainage ditch wall temperature in the Zhishan Tunnel increased rapidly from the entrance end to the interior of the tunnel and was approximately symmetrically distributed with respect to the outlet end. The wall temperature throughout the tunnel remained below 0 °C. The central drainage ditch wall temperature showed minimal variation along the longitudinal direction, remaining above 0 °C [Fig. 11(b)].

4. Freezing mechanisms of water in tunnel drainage ditches
4.1. Heat transfer characteristics of water in tunnel drainage ditches
Heat loss from groundwater in drainage ditches is mainly attributed to two mechanisms: (1) thermal interaction between the water and the air above the drainage ditches; (2) thermal interaction between the water and the concrete ditch walls. The convective heat transfer coefficient of air correlates with airflow velocity, exhibiting an approximately linear relationship:
(4)
va is the airflow velocity over the water surface, m·s−1, hc is the convective heat transfer coefficient of air, W/(m2·°C−1). The presence of cover plates over drainage ditches in high speed railway tunnels limits the long-term average airflow velocity above the water surface to typically less than 10 m·s−1. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that the air convective heat transfer coefficient under these conditions ranges between 4 and 40 W/(m2·°C−1).
The thermal transfer between water and concrete structures depends on multiple parameters, including flow velocity, kinematic viscosity, and Reynolds number. For laminar flow conditions (Reynolds number <2000), the convective heat transfer coefficient can be determined by:
(5)
hf is the convective heat transfer coefficient between the ditch wall and water, W/ (m2·°C−1); 
 is the thermal conductivity of water, W/(m·°C−1); d is the drainage diameter, m; 
 is the Laminar Flow Heat Transfer Correlation. Theoretical calculations indicate that the water and concrete convective heat transfer coefficient under laminar flow conditions ranges from 1000 and 1500 W/(m2·°C−1).
4.2. Flow heat transfer model
Comparative analysis of convective heat transfer mechanisms (water-air vs. water-concrete) reveals that thermal interactions within drainage ditches are predominantly governed by water to conduit wall heat transfer. Furthermore, the open channel flow characteristics in drainage ditches result in minimal velocity fluctuations along longitudinal cross sections. The tunnel drainage ditch heat transfer model incorporates three key simplifications: (1) Negligible thermal interaction between air and water above the ditch; (2) The tunnel ditch is a circular section, and under the same flow condition, the length of the contact between the water and the ditch wall is equivalent to the circumference of the circular ditch; (3) Uniform velocity distribution across all cross sections. Initial groundwater temperature at the ditch inlet is T0, with seepage water volumetric flow rate Vw. During the flow process, the temperature is 
, the temperature of the ditch wall concrete is 
. Fig. 13 illustrates this model. The governing equation for the differential element dx is derived through energy conservation principles:

The flow velocity Vw should be converted based on actual engineering, The tunnel drainage ditch has two cross sectional geometric shapes: rectangular and circular. The water flow velocity in the rectangular drainage ditch is v, w is the ditch width, and h is the water depth. The cross sectional flow area

(7)
To ensure equal flow rate and equal wetted perimeter between the actual drainage ditch and the equivalent ditch, it is converted into an equivalent circular ditch in the model. For a rectangular drainage ditch with width w, the equivalent circular radius is
, and the corresponding flow velocity is:

For circular ditches with radius ra, the equivalent circular radius is

The ditch wall temperature 
 follows a linear distribution from the ditch starting point to end point:
(10)
L is the total length of the drainage ditch, m; T1 is the temperature of the ditch wall at the starting point of the drainage ditch, °C; T2 is the temperature at the end ditch wall of the ditch, °C.
Since the formation temperature at the tunnel site remains constant, short-term temperature fluctuations primarily affect the temperature field of the lining structure, with negligible impact on the stratum temperature behind the insulation layer. Different drainage ditches exhibit distinct temperature fluctuation amplitudes and average temperature parameters. The temperature of the water flow at the origin of the drainage ditches in the tunnel's middle section is defined as 3 °C, subject to annual periodic fluctuations:

4.3. Temperature distribution patterns
According to the general drainage ditch design of high speed railway tunnel, the density of water is 1000 kg·m−3, and the specific heat capacity cp is 4.217 × 103 J/(kg·°C−1). The equivalent radius of the ditch is 2 × 10−2 m, the wetted perimeter p of the pipeline is 12.56 × 10−3 m, and the cross sectional area A of the pipeline is 12.56 × 10−4 m2. The convective heat transfer coefficient between water intake and ditch wall was 1500 W/(m2·°C−1). According to the numerical simulation results of the temperature field of the ditch wall, the temperature of the ditch wall is linearly decreased from 1 °C to −3 °C within 500 m. The influence of temperature fluctuation on the underground water temperature around the tunnel is taken as Taw = 1 °C, the underground water temperature is taken as T1 = 3 °C, and the water temperature in the ditch is obtained accordingly.
4.3.1. Effects of flow velocity on thermal behavior in drainage ditches
Fig. 14 illustrates the variation of water temperature in drainage ditches with identical wetted perimeters at different flow velocities. As the flow distance increases, the water temperature in the drainage ditch gradually approaches the temperature of the ditch wall. At a flow distance of approximately 100 m, the water temperatures for all flow velocities reach the ditch wall temperature. At a flow distance of 50 m, the slower the flow velocity, the greater the temperature decrease.

Fig. 15 illustrates the water temperature distribution in drainage ditches with the same flow velocity but different equivalent radii. At a flow distance of approximately 100 m, the water temperatures for all equivalent radii reach the drainage ditch wall temperature. At a flow distance of 50 m, the smaller the equivalent radius, the greater the water temperature decrease. Under identical flow velocity conditions, the larger the equivalent radius, the slower the water temperature decreases in the drainage ditch.

4.3.4. Influence of initial thermal conditions on water temperature evolution
When the short-term temperature fluctuation amplitude Taw = 0, the initial water temperature at the starting point of the drainage ditch was varied from the baseline value of 3 °C to 4 °C and 5 °C. This modification incorporates the initial temperature condition into the analytical solution. Fig. 17 illustrates the water temperature distribution in drainage ditches with the same flow velocity but different initial groundwater temperatures. When the flow distance reaches approximately 100 m, the water temperatures under all initial groundwater temperature conditions become equal to the drainage ditch wall temperature. Within the flow distance range of 0 to 50 m, the higher the initial groundwater temperature, the higher the water temperature in the ditch.

4.3.5. Impact of short-term thermal fluctuations on water temperature evolution
The initial temperature of the tunnel drainage ditch wall at the starting point is set to 1 °C, and the temperature at the 500 m point is set to 
, meaning that the amplitude of the ditch wall temperature fluctuation increases linearly from 0 to 3 °C over the 500 m distance. Fig. 18 illustrates the effect of short-term temperature fluctuations on water temperature under different flow velocities. Under short-term temperature fluctuation conditions, the water temperature in the drainage ditch fluctuates in response to the temperature fluctuations of the ditch wall. The flow velocity has no significant effect on the fluctuation range of the water temperature in the drainage ditch. After a flow distance of approximately 100 m, the water temperature in the ditch becomes consistent with the ditch wall temperature and fluctuates in synchronization with the wall temperature fluctuations [Fig. 18(a), 18(b), and 18(c)].

5.1. The corresponding relationship
Numerical simulations of the temperature field yielded the wall temperatures for both the thermal insulation side drainage ditch and the thermal insulation center drainage ditch under different tunnel temperature conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 19. Under the same temperature conditions in the tunnel, the temperature of the drainage ditch wall varied from season to season. In the cold season (October of the year to January of the following year), the temperature of the drainage ditch wall was higher than that observed during the warm season (February to April of the subsequent year).

The relationship between the flowing distance y of the ditch before freezing and the temperature x of the ditch wall before freezing under different flow rates in Table 3 and flow velocities was fitted with 
, and the results were shown in Fig. 20. Under conditions of identical equivalent radius but varying discharge, the exponent values of the fitted exponential functions remain essentially unchanged. This confirms discharge as the primary parameter governing freezing initiation distances in tunnel drainage ditches [Fig. 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c)].

5.3. Prediction of freezing sections
Water flowing within the drainage ditch undergoes heat exchange with the wetted surfaces of the ditch and freezes after traveling a certain distance. In accordance with the stipulations of JTG 3370.1–2018 Design Specification for Highway Tunnels (JTG 3370.1-2018, 2018) and TB 10003–2016 Code for Design of Railway Tunnels (TB10003-2016, 2016), the spacing of drainage side ditches should not exceed prescribed limits and is recommended to be maintained within the range of 10 to 20 m to ensure timely water discharge. In cold region tunnels, drain pipes are installed at the bottom of the side ditches every 10–20 m to divert water to the central drainage ditch. Therefore, the condition for freezing is defined as the flow distance being less than 20 m when freezing occurs. February 6 was selected as a representative day for predicting freeze-prone sections of the drainage ditches. Fig. 21 illustrates the corresponding temperature distribution patterns.

Fig. 21. The longitudinal temperature distribution in Hufengling tunnel on February 6.

Fig. 22(a) illustrates the predicted freezing sections of the insulation side ditches. During the cold season, the wall temperatures of the insulation side ditches are all above 0 °C, and no freezing occurs in the drainage ditches. During the warm season, the wall temperature is below 0 °C from 0 to 4000 m. For a water flow rate of 6.28 L·s−1 in the drainage ditch, according to Fig. 20(a), the ditch wall temperature is −2.5 °C when freezing occurs at a flow distance of 20 m. Therefore, freezing may occur in the insulation side ditches within approximately 2800 m from the tunnel portal. For a water flow rate of 12.56 L·s−1 in the drainage ditch, according to Fig. 20(b), the ditch wall temperature is −5.0 °C when freezing occurs at a flow distance of 20 m. Consequently, freezing will occur in the insulation side ditches within approximately 1800 m from the tunnel portal.

Fig. 22. Prediction of drainage ditches freezing section in the Hufengling tunnel.

Fig. 22(b) illustrates the predicted freezing-prone sections for the insulation central drainage ditches. During the cold season, the wall temperatures of the insulation central drainage ditches remain above 0 °C, and no freezing occurs in the drainage ditches. During the warm season, the wall temperature is below 0 °C from 1000 to 5500 m. Using the same criterion as specified, for a water flow rate of 6.28 L·s−1 in the drainage ditch, freezing will occur in the insulation central drainage ditches within approximately 1000 to 3400 m from the tunnel portal. For a water flow rate of 12.56 L·s−1, no freezing will occur in the insulation central drainage ditches.
Consequently, based on the predicted freezing-prone sections identified above, a comprehensive mitigation strategy involving zonal segmentation and the synergistic application of multiple measures can be implemented. Specifically, a combined approach utilizing a “thermal insulation layer with electric heat tracing” can be deployed in the predicted high-risk sections. The electric heat tracing system in these specific segments can be activated promptly upon the prediction of a freezing risk, thereby effectively preventing the drainage ditch from freezing in these sections.
6. Results
This study monitored the longitudinal temperature distribution along a cold-region tunnel. The temperature field of the drainage ditch walls was obtained using ANSYS numerical simulation, and the water temperature distribution within the ditch was analyzed by establishing a theoretical heat transfer model. Based on the aforementioned research, a freezing criterion was adopted wherein freezing occurs if the flow distance of water before complete freezing is less than 20 m. The freezing-prone sections of the drainage ditch under different flow rates were predicted, and the research process is illustrated in Fig. 23.

Taking this study as an example, the required input parameters for prediction in engineering applications and their sources are listed in Table 4. When applying this methodology to high-speed railway tunnels in cold regions, temperature data loggers should first be deployed in the target tunnel to obtain its longitudinal temperature distribution. Subsequently, the wall temperature of the drainage ditch can be determined from Fig. 19. Based on this, Fig. 20 is used to identify the critical wall temperature at which water freezes within a flow distance of 20 m in the ditch. By correlating this critical temperature with the longitudinal wall temperature distribution, the freezing-prone sections of the drainage ditch can be predicted.

7. Discussion
Water undergoes a phase transition into ice at 0 °C. During this phase change, the water within the ice-water mixture releases latent heat, which maintains the system temperature at approximately 0 °C until all water has frozen. This constitutes an isothermal or near-isothermal process. (1) Regarding the temperature field, the release of latent heat causes the water temperature to stagnate around 0 °C, forming a temperature plateau. The temperature will only resume its decrease after the water is completely frozen. In Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig. 17 of the paper, when the water-ice phase change is considered, the water temperature curve exhibits a brief plateau near 0 °C. This plateau indicates that the water flow remains at the critical freezing temperature over a longer flow distance. However, this phenomenon does not change the main conclusions of this paper on the freezing mechanisms and the identification of sections susceptible to freezing. (2) Regarding the prediction of freezing-prone sections, the release of latent heat slows the cooling rate of water, thereby extending the actual flow distance required for complete freezing. Consequently, a model that neglects latent heat would predict a more rapid temperature drop and a shorter distance to complete freezing, thus providing a conservative estimate from a purely thermal perspective. However, in practical engineering terms, the formation of ice—even in small amounts—results in volume expansion and uneven distribution, which can significantly impede water flow and initiate a clogging process. This hydraulic failure due to partial ice formation can occur well before the water is completely frozen. There will be no significant discrepancy between the model predicted sections prone to freezing and the actual freezing sections.
Simultaneously, during the theoretical derivation, this study incorporated several assumptions and simplifications to facilitate computation, thereby enabling the use of a theoretical model to investigate this complex engineering problem. A detailed analysis of these is provided below:
(1)
The assumption in Section 3.2 to “neglect the heat exchange between the air above and the water in the drainage ditch” is justified because cover slabs are typically installed over the drainage ditches in high-speed railway tunnels. The long-term average air velocity above the water surface within the enclosed ditch is very low, resulting in the heat exchange between the water and the pipe walls being the dominant thermal process. Therefore, the heat exchange with the overlying air was disregarded. In practical scenarios, the water simultaneously dissipates heat to the air. This implies that the actual heat loss rate of the water is somewhat greater than that calculated by the model. Consequently, at any given flow distance, the actual water temperature is lower than the model prediction, meaning the water temperature curve derived from the model in Section 3.3 is higher than the actual curve. Regarding the prediction of freezing-prone sections, under extreme external low temperatures, the actual water temperature decreases more rapidly, potentially leading to faster freezing. This would result in the actual freezing-prone sections being somewhat longer than those predicted by the model.
(2)
Actual tunnel drainage ditches typically operate under non-full flow conditions, which constitute open-channel flow. Since the first assumption in Section 3.2 already neglects the heat exchange between the air above and the water in the ditch, this study simplifies the tunnel drainage ditch as a full-flow circular pipe. This engineering simplification is based on two core principles: flow conservation and equality of the wetted perimeter. The wetted perimeter, which is the length of the contact line between the water and the ditch walls, directly determines the heat transfer area and is a key geometric parameter influencing heat exchange. This equivalent conversion aims to ensure that, under identical flow rates, the equivalent model and the actual ditch possess the same heat transfer surface area (excluding the air-water interface), thereby maintaining a consistent heat loss rate per unit flow length. Precisely because the first assumption in Section 3.2 disregards the air-water heat exchange, this equivalent conversion has negligible impact on the results, apart from minor inherent errors.
(3)
When establishing the heat transfer model for the water within the drainage ditch, the thermal diffusion term was neglected to simplify the analysis and highlight the dominant convective heat transfer process. In practical scenarios, thermal diffusion exerts a certain influence on the water temperature distribution, particularly in regions with low flow velocity or significant temperature gradients. However, under the flow velocities and drainage ditch scales considered in this study, the Péclet number—which characterizes the ratio of convective to diffusive transport effects—is significantly greater than 1. This indicates that the heat transport process is dominated by convection, and the relative contribution of diffusion is substantially smaller than that of convective effects. Physically, the diffusion term acts to smooth temperature gradients. Consequently, neglecting this term results in a more direct response in the predicted water temperature changes. When water reaches a specific location, its temperature responds immediately to the local wall temperature at that point, without being averaged or influenced by the wall temperatures from upstream or downstream locations. In very short distances near the tunnel portal, when flow velocities are extremely low, the relative contribution of the diffusion term may increase slightly. Therefore, within the accuracy requirements for engineering applications, neglecting the diffusion term does not alter the main conclusions of this paper concerning the freezing mechanism and the prediction of freezing-prone sections. Furthermore, omitting the diffusion term allows the model to maintain the feasibility of an analytical solution while still accurately capturing the core physical processes.
(4)
Given the complex flow paths in the drainage ditches of high-speed railway tunnels in cold regions, assuming laminar flow state constitutes a reasonable and relatively conservative initial approximation. During winter, under low-temperature conditions, an ice-water mixture can form in the drainage ditch, making high-flow-rate scenarios highly improbable. The slower the water velocity, the greater its temperature decrease. Consequently, under high flow rates, the actual flow distance required for water to freeze would exceed the estimated value derived from low-flow-state models. As is clearly evident in Fig. 20, a higher flow rate results in a longer flow distance before the water completely freezes. Therefore, under high flow rate conditions, the actual freezing distance would be shorter than that predicted by the model. In contrast, under extreme low-temperature conditions, partial freezing of water within the drainage ditch occurs, which reduces the flow velocity. This, in turn, leads to an actual freezing distance that is longer than the model prediction.
In summary, the water-ice phase change and the adopted computational assumptions exert a minor influence on the specific numerical values of the flow distance before complete freezing and the water temperature distribution; however, they do not affect the primary conclusions of this paper. Some discrepancies exist between the model and the actual conditions, but these errors are relatively small and thus have only a limited impact on the final predictive results. In practical engineering applications for freezing damage prediction, such minor error margins are considered acceptable.
8. Conclusion
This study conducted a six-month temperature monitoring program in the representative cold-region tunnels of Hu Fengling and Zhishan in Northeast China. The temperature distribution of high-speed railway tunnels in severe cold areas was obtained. A numerical model was established using ANSYS to analyze the temperature distribution patterns on the walls of drainage ditches in cold-region tunnels. A theoretical computational model for heat transfer during water flow in the drainage ditches was developed to investigate the water freezing mechanism. Based on the temperature data from February 6th in the Hu Fengling Tunnel, the sections prone to freezing in its drainage ditches were predicted. The main conclusions are as follows:
(1)
In the Hufengling Tunnel, the monthly average temperature from December to February of the following year increases with increasing distance from the tunnel portal. From March to May of the following year, the monthly average temperature rises rapidly within 100 m of the tunnel entrance. The temperature in the middle section of the tunnel shows little change. From December to April of the following year, the average temperature at the entrance of the Hufengling Tunnel is negative. In the Zhishan Tunnel, the monthly average temperatures at all monitoring sections exhibit a symmetric distribution along the tunnel longitudinal direction. The temperature increases with increasing distance from the tunnel portal. From December to April of the following year, the monthly average temperatures are all below 0 °C. As the climate warms, the differences in monthly average temperature among the tunnel sections gradually decrease.
(2)
The tunnel thermal insulation side drainage ditch and the thermal insulation center drainage ditch have negative temperature in winter, and the deeply buried center drainage ditch is positive temperature. The influence of short-term temperature fluctuation on the temperature field of the drainage ditch decreases with the increase of depth, and has no effect on the temperature at the bottom of the tunnel drainage ditch. Comprehensively comparing the freezing front positions of different types of tunnel drainage ditches, the maximum freezing depths of these ditches are ranked from largest to smallest as follows: the tunnel side drainage ditch, the deeply buried central drainage ditch, and the thermal insulation central drainage ditch. Under the condition of extreme low temperature, the freezing in the thermal insulation side drainage ditch may occur in the whole tunnel of the Hufengling Tunnel and Zhishan Tunnel.

After flowing a certain distance in the drainage ditches, the water temperature becomes nearly identical to the boundary surface temperature of the drainage ditches. Under the condition that other factors remain constant, the rate of decrease in water temperature within the drainage ditches decreases with increasing flow velocity and equivalent radius, but increases with a higher convective heat transfer coefficient. A higher initial water temperature results in a correspondingly higher temperature in the drainage ditches. Under short-term temperature fluctuation conditions, the water temperature in the drainage ditches fluctuates with the fluctuations of the boundary surface temperature. Flow velocity has an insignificant influence on the fluctuation range of the water temperature in the drainage ditches. When the equivalent radius of the drainage ditches remains constant, flow rate is the dominant factor influencing the flow distance before freezing of water in the drainage ditches.
(4)
In the Hufengling Tunnel, freezing does not occur in the drainage ditch during the cooling season. However, during the warming season, when the water flow rate in the ditch is 6.28 L·s−1, freezing occurs in the insulated side ditch within approximately 2800 m from the tunnel entrance. Freezing also occurs in the insulated central water ditch within approximately 1000 m to 3400 m from the tunnel entrance. Moreover, a higher flow rate in the ditch corresponds to a shorter freezing section. Freezing occurs within specific ranges under different flow rates. Based on the prediction results, the electric heat tracing system can be activated in advance in the corresponding sections to prevent freezing.

Based on the findings and limitations of this study, future research will focus on developing a refined multiphysics coupling model that comprehensively accounts for thermal diffusion effects and the latent heat of water-ice phase change. This model aims to more accurately characterize the freezing process and temperature evolution of water within drainage ditches. Furthermore, a systematic deployment of temperature sensors is planned in new or retrofitted tunnels to enable long-term monitoring of water temperature and ditch wall temperature during operational periods, thereby obtaining critical validation data. On this basis, systematic numerical simulations and multi-parameter optimization design studies will be conducted for various anti-freezing and insulation measures. These efforts will evaluate the anti-freezing effectiveness and economic feasibility of different measures under varying working conditions, providing theoretical foundations and technical support for the anti-freezing design and maintenance decision-making of drainage systems in cold-region tunnels.
