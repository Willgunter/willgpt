1. Introduction
The energy crisis and environmental pollution are becoming more and more serious, and all regions are committed to the development and utilization of renewable energy [[1], [2], [3]]. In the field of transportation, automobile manufacturers are rapidly developing electric vehicle technology and increasing the output of electric vehicles. As reported from International Energy Agency, the global sales of new energy vehicles show exponential growth, which in China account for 60 % of the global sales [4], as showed in Fig. 1. Although the demand has increased, there are still several factors that hinder the development of the electric vehicles, including the low reliability during long-distance travel and the short service life of the battery packs [5,6].

There are many factors that affect the performance of electric vehicle battery packs, but the dominant factor is the operating temperature. The optimum operating temperatures of Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles are commonly between 15 °C to 40 °C, and the maximum temperature differences between batteries are <5 °C [[7], [8], [9]]. Since the working temperature of Lithium-ion battery is lower than 15 °C, the overall capacity decreases and the internal resistance of the battery increases [10], while the temperature higher than 40 °C could lead to irreversible capacity loss of Lithium-ion batteries and trigger the risk of thermal runaway (TR) [11]. Therefore, it is very important to design and implement an efficient battery thermal management system (BTMS) to adjust the temperature within a safe operating range [12]. However, some traditional thermal management technologies, such as active air cooling and liquid cooling systems, are limited by low heat transfer rate, high initial and maintenance costs, or complexity of cooling systems [13,14]. To address these challenges, researchers and engineers have turned to seek versatile innovative solutions among which phase change materials (PCMs) are emerging as a promising approach for thermal management in Lithium-ion battery systems [15]. PCMs are substances that absorb or release energy and provide latent heat through changes in physical phase states without changing temperature. Latent heat refers to the heat absorbed or released by a unit mass of material during phase change, which is usually very large [16,17]. In the BTMSs, by embedding PCMs within the battery pack or its surrounding components, the heat generated during charging or high temperature operating conditions would be absorbed by PCMs, which subsequently releases during discharging or low temperature periods, effectively moderating temperature fluctuations and reducing thermal stress on the cells [18,19]. Moreover, the latent heat absorption and release characteristics of PCMs enable passive thermal regulation, minimizing the reliance on active cooling systems and then reducing energy consumption, which could be favorable to enhance the overall efficiency and autonomy of battery-powered applications [20].However, the inherent limitations of conventional PCMs, such as low thermal conductivity, narrow phase change temperature range, and potential leakage issues, have stimulated intensive research efforts into modifying and enhancing the performance of PCMs [[21], [22], [23]].
PCM plays a crucial role in the BTMSs, since it would regulate the temperature of batteries by absorbing or releasing a lot of heat in the phase change process. In this paper, the working principle, types, thermal properties, modification methods and application of PCMs in BTMSs are comprehensively analyzed, and the main challenges and development prospect are also discussed.

The review papers related to the PCM-based Lithium-ion BTMSs mainly focus on novel thermal management designs (such as hybrid BTMSs) [[32], [33], [34]]. For conventional PCM-based BTMSs, enhancing PCM thermal conductivity and extending heat transfer area are very common ways to accelerate heat extraction [[35], [36], [37]]. Enhancement methods of PCMs were mentioned like adding high thermal conductivity materials into PCMs [10,[29], [30], [31],38]. But the investigation on the modified methods for PCMs is still not comprehensive, and the reviews are pretty insufficient on modified PCMs applied to BTMSs. The novelty of this review mainly lies on that the specific applications of PCMs in BTMSs are discussed in details, especially the progress of the latest modification techniques and material properties. Compared with other reviews, this review may pay more attention to the latest material research and development, practical application and future development prospect to attritbute more forward-looking insights.
The main purpose of this paper is to comprehensively summarize various modification methods of PCMs and their applications in BTMSs, which would be helpful to further understanding of PCMs and their applications. The structural framework of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the classification and characteristics of PCMs, and Section 3 describes different methods to improve the properties of PCMs. Section 4 introduces the application of PCMs in the field of batteries. Some key conclusions and prospects are summarized in Section 5.
2. Categorization and properties of PCMs
2.1. Types of PCMs
The classification of PCMs is given in Fig. 2. According to the substance types, PCMs are usually divided into inorganic PCMs, organic PCMs, and eutectic PCMs [39]. Organic PCMs mainly include paraffin, fatty acids, esters, and aromatic hydrocarbons, etc., and their solid-state is readily formable in addition to less corrosive, stable performance and less toxicity, which does not easily appear supercooling and phase separation [40]. Typical inorganic PCMs such as inorganic hydration salts have high energy storage density, relatively high thermal conductivity, and low cost [41]. Eutectic PCMs are usually composed of two or more components, which can be organic-organic, inorganic-inorganic, or inorganic-organic combinations [42,43].

Fig. 2. The classification of PCMs.

PCMs are also classified into low-temperature PCMs (< 15 °C), medium-temperature PCMs (15 °C–90 °C) and high-temperature PCMs (> 90 °C) [44]. Medium and low-temperature PCMs are mainly used in the fields of daily life, building energy saving [45], agricultural cold and heat storage [46], solar energy utilization [47], power peak regulation [48], and so on. High-temperature PCMs are mainly applied in industrial waste heat recovery [49], the aerospace industry, or other fields [50].
According to the phase transitions, PCMs are also classified into solid-liquid, solid-solid, solid-gas and liquid-gas PCMs [20,51]. Although the solid-gas and liquid-gas phase transformation processes could store more heat, they are extremely difficult to be applied because of the sudden increase in the volume of the system due to the gas generation in the phase transformation. From the view of the application, the price of heat storage materials with solid-liquid PCMs is low, but the material itself has supercooling and phase separation, which could give rise to leak, causing pollution to the environment, and making the price of packaging device increase [52]. Compared with solid-liquid PCMs, undercooling and phase separation don't happen in solid-solid PCMs, indicating that they are safer and more stable, and the preparations are more simple. Although the price is high, the cost performance of solid-solid PCMs is better than solid-liquid ones [53].
2.2. Characteristics of various PCMs
2.2.1. Organic PCMs
Organic PCMs could be mainly classified into two types: paraffin-based materials including various alkanes and their mixtures, and non-paraffin-based materials including fatty acids, alcohols, lipids and their derivatives [54,55]. Organic PCMs could be melted and solidified multiple times without phase separation, which would give rise to a high latent heat of phase transition [56,57]. In addition, little or no subcooling and non-corrosiveness emerges in the solidification, which suggest that they are usually physically and chemically stable with a long service life.
The general formula of paraffin wax (PW) is CnH2n+2, which is also known as an alkane. Paraffin can be divided into gaseous pure alkanes with 1–4 carbons, liquid paraffin with 5–17 carbons, and solid waxes with >17 carbons, depending on the number of carbon atoms and their physical state at room temperature [58]. The general formula of fatty acids is CnH2nO2, which have a long fat chain, covered by a carboxyl group, which can be straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated [59].
The thermal physical properties of some common organic PCMs are given in Table 2.

According to Table 2, the paraffin-based PCMs have a wide range of phase change temperatures, which can meet different applications from low temperature to high temperature, and most paraffin-based PCMs have high phase change latent heat and good heat storage capacity. The organic acid PCMs have both high phase change temperature (usually between 50 °C and 70 °C) and high phase change latent heat value. However, compared with the paraffin-based PCMs, the organic acids PCMs have lower thermal conductivity, which would greatly limit their application.
By serving graphene nanosheets (GNP) as thermal conductivity enhancer and organic PCM being melted at 21 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C and 46 °C [69], a GNP reinforced organic PCM was prepared. The thermal conductivity with lifting the temperature from 25 °C to 50 °C increases greatly with the increase of GNP concentration, and the undercooling temperature of composite PCMs is <10 °C. Physical interaction emerges between GNP and organic PCM, but there is no chemical interaction. Electrohydrodynamics (EHD), as an active heat transfer enhancement technology, can dynamically control the performance of latent heat storage system [70]. Through combining numerical simulation and experimental investigation [70], the melting characteristics of octadecane was evaluated after adding EHD. Compared with natural melting, the solid-liquid interface of PW with EHD is irregular, and the melting time shortens by about 14 times. Based on high pressure foaming method, a phase change composite material was developed with mesophase pitch-based carbon foam (MPCF) and paraffin to enhance the thermal conductivity [71]. The thermal conductivity of MPCF is 186.2 W/(m·K), which could effectively improve thermal conductivity of PW. The phase change composite material emerges great potential in thermal energy storage system. Lv et al. [72] introduced CO2 activated phoenix leaf biochar (CPL) into paraffin and SA to improve their thermal conductivity, and they measured the thermal conductivity of original PCM and composite PCMs by transient plane heat source method. Compared with original paraffin and SA, the thermal conductivities of paraffin/CPL and SA/CPL ramp up from 0.302 W/(m·K) and 0.385 W/(m·K) to 0.456 W/(m·K) and 0.405 W/(m·K), respectively. Graphene nanoplatelets and nano SiO2 were evenly mixed with paraffin to enhance the thermal energy storage capabilities [73]. The thermal conductivity of paraffin increases by 42 %, while the melting temperature decreases by 3.12 °C and the solidification temperature increases by 2.65 °C. With rising the dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets and nano SiO2, the properties of PW such as latent heat and specific heat are improved.
2.2.2. Inorganic PCMs
Inorganic PCMs are further classified as salt hydrate and metallics. Salt hydrate is composed of inorganic salt and water, and the general formula is AB·nH2O. And many salt hydrates are sufficiently inexpensive for use in storage [74].
Table 3 lists the thermal physical properties of some common inorganic PCMs.

Generally, the phase transition temperature of inorganic salt hydrate is below 120 °C, and its latent heat value is high, which suggest that it could be more suitable for low-temperature application, especially in solar energy utilization [83]. However, its high supercooling needs to be suppressed to be well applied to the thermal management of solar energy systems [84]. Na2SO4·10H2O is a more common salt hydrate, with suitable phase transition temperature (32.4 °C) and phase transition latent heat of 241 kJ/kg. By modification of Na2SO4·10H2O [85], a composite PCM was constructed with high phase transition latent heat and energy storage stability. Metal inorganic PCMs such as Cu, Al and Ga usually have higher phase change temperature over 500 °C, which are more suitable for high temperature applications like solar thermal power generation and industrial waste heat recovery [79,86].
2.2.3. Eutectic PCMs
Eutectic PCMs are generally combinations of materials with similar or consistent melting points and freezing points, including binary or multicomponent eutectic systems of inorganic-inorganic, organic-organic or inorganic-organic PCMs [28,87,88]. By mixing a variety of PCMs, the limitations of any single PCM can be overcome, which means that it could be better applied to practical situations.
Wen et al. [89] prepared lauric acid (LA)-MA-PA (LMP) ternary eutectic PCMs. The thermophysical properties of PCMs are listed in Table 4. After 100 thermal cycles, the melting temperature and solidification temperature of LMP fall by 0.08 °C and 0.27 °C, respectively, and the melting enthalpy and solidification enthalpy decrease by 0.14 J/g and 0.57 J/g, respectively, indicating that LMP has good thermal reliability.

MA	54.16	52.01	186.39	184.41
PA	62.45	60.06	222.31	222.32
LMP (before thermal cycles)	33.70	32.56	153.23	151.46
LMP (after thermal cycles)	33.62	32.29	153.09	150.89
Based on melt impregnation method, composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were prepared with different mass fractions by taking binary eutectic mixture of capric acid (CA) and SA as PCM, SiO2 as nano-reinforcing agent, expanded graphite (EG) and nano-CuO as thermal conductivity reinforcing agent [90]. The melting temperature and solidification temperature of CA-SA/SiO2/EG are 30.62 °C and 25.2 °C, and the latent heat of melting and solidification are 156.50 J/g and 144.20 J/g, respectively. The melting temperature and solidification temperature of CA-SA/SiO2/CuO are 29.09 °C and 25.30 °C, and the latent heats of melting and solidification are 152.60 J/g and 140.70 J/g, respectively.
An aliphatic eutectic phase change material (AEPCM) was designed for low temperature [91]. The phase change temperature and latent heat are −3.58-16.21 °C and 144.01–195.96 J/g, respectively. AEPCM has higher thermal stability than pure tetradecane, with a mass loss reduced from 13.344 % to 62.76 % at 180 °C. An eutectic PCM was prepared with decanoic acid, n-octanoic acid and n-tetradecane, and added nano-graphite [92]. The low-temperature eutectic PCM prepared with the mass ratio of decanoic acid, n-octanoic acid, n-tetradecane and nano-graphite of 0.231: 0.469: 0.3: 0.06 has the best thermal properties, including the melting point of 0.32 °C, the latent heat of melting of 163.3 J/g, the thermal conductivity of 0.83 W/(m·K) and the supercooling of 0.47 °C, which suggest that it could be suitable for cold storage operation. Nano-graphite can effectively improve the thermal conductivity of eutectic PCM. Adding 6 % nano-graphite could lift the thermal conductivity of eutectic PCM by about 4 times and reduce the supercooling by about 64 %. The sample can maintain good chemical and thermal stability even after 200 phase change cycles.
In a word, organic PCMs possess flexible phase change temperature tunability, while inorganic PCMs exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity and stability. Eutectic PCMs integrate their merits with a wide range of application potentials, which become the investication focus of many scholars at present.
3. Modification methods of PCMs
Pure PCMs have drawbacks such as poor thermal conductivity and leakage during the phase change process [[93], [94], [95]]. To overcome the limitations, there are many methods to improve and optimize the structure and properties of PCMs [21,96].
3.1. Stable CPCM
The stable CPCM is composed of regular PCMs and supporting materials with high thermal conductivity, which could effectively enhance the properties of PCMs. There are commonly three types of support materials: porous material that could prevent leakage of PCMs, nano-material that could improve the thermal characteristics of the PCMs, and physically blending polymer component with PCM to enhance the thermal and mechanical stability [[97], [98], [99]]. The support materials break through the limitations of poor thermal conductivity and leakage of PCMs. However, the thermal energy storage capacity of the stable CPCM reduces compared to pure PCMs, which could be related to that the support material molecules are not involved in thermal energy storage [100,101].
3.1.1. Porous material
Porous materials can better support PCMs due to their larger surface area, higher thermal conductivity, and better chemical compatibility [94,102]. There are four main types of porous materials: carbon-based porous materials including EG [103] and foamed carbon [104], etc., organic polymer materials such as polyurethane foam (PUF) [105], polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [106], etc., metallic porous materials including copper foam [67], aluminum foam [107], etc., and inorganic porous materials such as silicon dioxide [108].
Carbon-based porous materials are made by pyrolyzing, activating natural carbon, and synthetic precursors. Carbon-based porous materials usually derived from biomass and waste, are cheaper, non-toxic, and widely available. Carbon-based porous materials are widely used in supercapacitors [100], Lithium-ion batteries [101], and other fields. Carbon-based porous materials have attracted widespread attention as support materials for PCMs because of their low density, flexible morphology, good thermal stability, and high electronic conductivity [109]. Atinafu et al. [110] prepared a porous carbon from dewaxed cotton using Mg(OH)2 to develop CPCM. By template method, Liu et al. [111] prepared porous carbon by combining stannic chloride and sodium polyacrylate in a ratio of 5:14. CPCM prepared by filling paraffin into porous carbon, has good chemical stability, reliable thermal stability and durability, and latent heat accumulation of 35 J/g. A shape-stable PCM was prepared by mesoporous n-doped porous carbon-impregnated MA-SA eutectic mixture [112], and the porous carbon in the presence of KCl/ZnCl2 was prepared by melamine reacting with glucose, as shown in Fig. 3. The composite emerges a maximum load of 88 % and high stability after 100 thermal cycles. The heat storage capacity is about 164 kJ/kg, and the thermal conductivity increases by about 118 % compared with the eutectic mixture. Chen et al. [113] pointed out that compared with traditional CPCMs, carbon-based CPCMs have better mechanical strength and thermal conductivity, higher thermal stability, and excellent light absorption performance. In solar distillation, the evaporative heat of the prepared PCM is 142.2 J/g, and the sensible heat is 25.7 J/g, and heat storage efficiency is 58.8 %, which means that the carbon-based CPCMs have good heat storage and evaporative heat storage properties, which could be well employed in the solar distillation.

PUF is a crosslinked polymer with an open- and closed-cell structure. The cellular materials are formed by the reaction of polyols and isocyanates in the presence of catalysts, additives, and blowing agents. PUF is widely used as an insulating material because of its low thermal conductivity, good thermal insulation performance, chemical stability, and low cost [114]. Zhai et al. [115] prepared a composite phase change microcapsule material based on PUF by in-situ polymerization. The thermal conductivity of composite phase change microcapsule material added with PUF lifts by 108 % compared with ordinary composite phase change microcapsule material, and the cyclic and thermal stability are also enhanced. By selecting suitable surfactants and synthesis parameters, Agresti et al. [53] synthesized a CPCM with complete encapsulation and good thermal stability by encapsulating RT21HC with phase transition temperature of 21 °C into PMMA shell through emulsion polymerization process.
NematpourKeshteli et al. [116] added metal foams with different porosity (0.92–0.98) to PCM, and noted that the composite melting time is 69.52 % shorter than that of pure PCM. Porous metal foams have higher thermal conductivity, which could make PCM have better heat dissipation and heat absorption performance, but its manufacturing cost is high, and oxidation corrosion may happen.
Silica is a highly porous material with low density and large internal surface area. Its three-dimensional (3D) network structure prevents PCM leakage in the phase transitions. Silica with good compressive, tensile, and flexural strength, could be seen as a substitute for concrete in building materials [117]. Saravanakumar et al. [118] dispersed nano-silica in paraffin with three different volume fractions (0.5 vol%, 1.0 vol% and 2.0 vol%) to prepare nano-silica-based paraffin. By means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nano-silica/PCM still has good thermal stability after 100 thermal cycles.
Overall, incorporating porous materials is a crucial method for modifying PCMs, aiming to enhance their thermal conductivity, stability, and lifespan. However, as for the selection, preparation, and composite process of porous materials, many factors such as compatibility with PCMs, process complexity, and cost-effectiveness should be considerd to ensure that the prepared composite materials possess excellent performance and reliability in specific applications.
3.1.2. Nano-particles
Nanoparticles in nanoscale materials, with particle sizes <100 nm, have a very high surface-to-volume ratio and good thermal conductivity. Therefore, nanoparticles are widely used in latent heat storage systems [119], to improve the thermal conductivity of regular PCMs [120,121]. Nanoparticles could act as catalysts for PCMs, since they urge to enhance the heat transfer. The thermal conductivity enhancement of PCM depends on the concentration of the nanoparticles, Brownian motion, interfacial thermal resistance, and intermolecular interactions [[122], [123], [124], [125]].
Studies are summarized on the enhancement of thermal properties of PCMs with common composite nanoparticles, as seen in Table 5.

As can be seen from Table 5, the thermal conductivity of PCMs could be enhanced to different degrees by adding different types and different mass fractions of nanoparticles, while the latent heat of PCMs goes down. With lifting the mass fraction of added metallic nanoparticles such as Cu and Ag, the melting temperature and latent heat of PCMs reduce, while the thermal conductivity increases. However, increasing the mass fraction of nanoparticles such as CNTs, Al2O3 and TiO2 could promote an elevation in the melting temperature of PCMs. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the appropriate nanoparticles and the addition ratio according to the actual application requirements.
Tan et al. [134] added nano‑copper oxide and nano‑silicon dioxide into the composite PCM of LA and SA as thermal conductivity enhancing materials. Compared with composite PCM, the latent heats of melting and solidification of composite PCM with nanoparticles decrease by 5.91 % and 5.44 % respectively, while the thermal conductivity increases by 30 %. By infusing Al2O3-graphene binary composite materials into PW [135], compared with pure PW, the latent heat and thermal conductivity of PW/Al2O3-graphene prompt by about 10 % and 180 %, respectively. There is no chemical interaction between paraffin and nanoparticles according to Fourier transform infrared spectrum. According to TGA analysis, adding Al2O3-graphene particles into PW is favorable to lift the thermal stability of PW. The higher thermal conductivity and enthalpy of composite materials would provide a great choice for solar photovoltaic thermal system and thermal energy storage systems.
There are also many investigations that have systematically probed the properties of nano-enhanced PCMs at the atomic structure level based on molecular dynamics (MD) method. Based on MD method, thermal and phonon transport characteristics of CuO-paraffin were evaluated to identify deeply the action mechanism of nanomaterials on PCM [136]. CuO nanoparticle could enhance thermal conductivity of paraffin, and the enhancement is further strengthened with lifting the nanoparticle mass fraction. Nanoparticle reduces the phonon scattering and promotes the heat transfer, which would contribute to the thermal conductivity enhancement of PCM. By building the molecular model of PA/graphene CPCM, the effects of temperature and graphene mass fraction were calculated on mean square displacement, self-diffusion coefficient, radial distribution function, rotation radius, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity [137]. The phase transition temperature of CPCM decreases with lifting the graphene mass fraction. The addition of graphene could be favorable to improve the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of CPCM.
In summary, nano-particles could enhance the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of PCMs. However, incorporating nano-particles also encounters challenges such as reaping uniform dispersion, maintaining stability, managing complex preparation processes, and addressing cost considerations.
3.1.3. Physically blending polymer component
Polymer components are physically blended as the supporting material to hinder the flow of molten PCM and guarantee the lifespan and durability of PCM. The typical polymer materials usually refer to polyethylene (PE) [138], epoxy resin (ER) [139], polystyrene-b-poly (ethylene-ran-butylene)-b-polystyrene (SEBS) [140] and so on.
Yang et al. [141] prepared flexible CPCMs through physically blending polymers, incorporating small molecules of PW with into a cross-linked polymer matrix formed by a blend of SEBS and polyolefin elastomer (POE). The CPCMs possess an ideal phase change enthalpy of 127.5 J/g, a high thermal conductivity of 0.99 W·m−1·K−1, and high shape stability, which could readily meet the requirements of various applications.
Based on physically blending polymers method, a high-stable CPCM was synthesized from taking paraffin as PCMs and resorcinol-furfural polymer framework [99]. The mass retention rate of the CPCM lifts up to 99.84 wt% under a simulative operating temperature of 60 °C for 12 h. In addition, the CPCM possesses suitable thermophysical properties, including phase change enthalpy, phase change temperature region and thermal conductivity of 107.18 J·g−1, 40–55 °C and 1.58 W·m−1·K−1, respectively.
Rahmalina et al. [142] physically blended high-density PE with paraffin, to prepare a paraffin/PE-based CPCM for BTMS application. The melting temperature of CPCM slightly decreases from 60.4 °C to 60.1 °C compared with paraffin, while the heat fusion goes down by 2.9 %. Aulakh et al. [143] developed a shape-stable CPCM by adopting SEBS as the polymer component, paraffin as the PCM and EG as the thermal conductive components. The prepared CPCM has a good potential for thermal energy storage application with the latent heat of 163.25 J/g and the thermal conductivity of 0.501 W·m−1·K−1, respectively.
Overall, the physical blending of polymers is a flexible and effective method for developing PCMs with ideal thermal performance. It is essential to comprehensively consider material selection, process optimization, and final performance requirements to reap optimal applications.
3.2. Micro/Nano encapsulation
Encapsulation is a method of encapsulating tiny gases, liquids or solids into solid particles using polymeric materials to improve properties of the wrapped materials. The wrapped material is called the core material, while the material surrounding the core material is called the shell material. Encapsulated phase change materials (EPCMs) refer to materials formed by encapsulating PCMs into organic or inorganic shells [144,145], as shown in Fig. 4. According to the size of PCM capsules, EPCMs can be divided into two categories: micro-encapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) and nano-encapsulated phase change material (NEPCM) [146]. PCM is wrapped in a tiny capsule, which could avoid the defects of PCM itself, and improve its thermal conduction, and weaken the influence of phase change temperature [147,148]. EPCMs with small size, high thermal efficiency and chemical stability have been applied in the use of solar energy [63], temperature control [149], air conditioning [150] and other fields [[151], [152], [153]].

Fig. 4. Schematic diagram of EPCMs.

The perfect performance of EPCMs means the formation of a complete shell, no leakage and no doping of impurities [144]. In addition, the encapsulation ratio (η) and encapsulation efficiency (E) are two important indexes to evaluate the encapsulation performance [154], which are demermined by:
(1)
(2)
where, m and s refer to melting and solidification, ΔHm,EPCM and ΔHs,EPCM the enthalpy of melting and solidification of EPCM, ΔHm,PCM and ΔHs,PCM the enthalpy of melting and solidification of pure PCM, respectively.
3.2.1. Shell materials for EPCM
The shell material is very important, which directly affects the performance and application of EPCMs. The shell material must possess excellent packaging performance, thermal conductivity, chemical stability, sufficient mechanical strength and sustainability to ensure the stability and reliability of the EPCMs in the long-term use [155,156]. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the above factors when designing and selecting shell materials. The shell materials of phase change capsules can be classified into organic, inorganic and hybrid materials [157,158]. The common shell materials are depicted in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. The different types of common shell materials.

Organic shell materials have been widely used, since they with favorable chemical compatibility could effectively encapsulate PCMs. After selecting suitable surfactants and synthesis parameters, Agresti et al. [53] prepared a NEPCM by encapsulating PCMs into PMMA shell base on emulsion polymerization. The spherical structure of the NEPCM is obvious with different nucleating agents, and the encapsulation indexes appear very high.
From taking hexadecylamine (HDA) as PCMs, polystyrene (PS) and CaCO3 as wall materials [159], PS/CaCO3/HDA MEPCMs were prepared by ultrasonic emulsification. The thermal conductivity of MEPCMs is 0.491 W/(m·K), which is 3.41 times that of pure HDA. The highest latent heat of PS/CaCO3/HDA MEPCMs is 33.96 kJ/kg, and there is no leakage existed. PS/CaCO3/HDA MEPCMs have good stability and high thermal conductivity, and have good heat storage performance at low temperature.
Inorganic shell materials with excellent mechanical strength and stability are commonly utilized under high-temperature scenario. Nicoonahad et al. [160] prepared NEPCM with TiO2 shell by sol-gel method. From Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis, there is no chemical interaction between CA and TiO2 existed, and its crystal phase remains unchanged. The prepared NEPCM has good thermal reliability and stability. Guo et al. [161] prepared phase change microcapsules with silica as shell material, and characterized the structure and properties of the microcapsules. The microcapsules are well encapsulated, and the single microcapsule particles are spherical, with an average particle size of 7.79 μm, the highest encapsulation efficiency of 60.6 % and the melting enthalpy of 68.48 J/g. And there is not obvious mass loss for the microcapsules of silica shell material below 400 °C, indicating that the samples have good thermal stability.
Hybrid shell materials combine the virtues of both organic and inorganic shell materials, which possess typically preferable overall performance. Liu et al. [162] designed a phase change capsule with nano-TiO2 encapsulated by PMMA. PMMA forms a porous supporting structure with nano-TiO2 as the skeleton node, which is favorable for paraffin encapsulation. TiO2 facilitates the compatibility and thermal conductivity of PMMA with PCMs, and it is also helpful to avoid the phase separation in the polymerization. The thermal conductivity of the phase change capsule is twice as high as that of pure paraffin with the photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.31 %, and the latent heat of 102.52 J/g. Wang et al. [163] synthesized NEPCMs with n-tetradecane as the core material and melamine–urea–formaldehyde (MUF) as shell material, and then modified the samples with MUF-TiO2 hybrid shell. With the increase of TiO2, the thermal conductivity of NEPCMs coated with hybrid shell materials lifts by 22.96 %–32.59 % compared with that only coated with MUF.
A simplified MD model was developed for NEPCMs with amorphous silica as the shell and paraffin as the core [164]. The linear density of paraffin close to the shell reduces, but that far away from the shell augments compared with the pure paraffin. Silica shell breaks the symmetry of the system, which would result in the anisotropy of mean square displacement in different directions. Diffusion coefficient of paraffin is weakened by the addition of the silica shell.
3.2.2. Encapsulation methods
At present, the preparation methods of EPCMs mainly refer to physical method, chemical method and physical-chemical method. The common physical methods include spray drying and solvent evaporation [149,165]. Chemical methods include interfacial polymerization, in situ polymerization and suspention polymerization [166,167]. Physical-chemical methods mainly include sol-gel method and ionic gelation [144,168], which can be favorable to produce smaller EPCMs [169,170].
Methaapanon et al. [171] prepared MEPCM with silica as shell and octadecane and methyl palmitate as core materials. PCM disperses in the shell material solution to form an emulsion dispersion, then the emulsion dispersion is atomized into fine droplets in a dry hot air by an atomizing device, and the solvent for dissolving the shell material quickly evaporates when being heated. The shell material forms a reticular membrane structure with screening function, and the PCM retains within the shell.
For EPCM prepared by solvent evaporation, the shell material first dissolves in the continuous phase, and the capsule wall forms on the surface of the PCM after solvent evaporation [172]. Ekanem et al. [173] developed a W/O/W monodisperse MEPCM with core-shell structure by the solvent evaporation. The diameter of microcapsule is >200 μm, and the thickness of shell is 10 μm, and the encapsulation efficiency is 96 %. The solvent evaporation has many limitations, since it is necessary to set volatile medium as solvent. Because solvent volatilization takes long period, it is impossible to realize large-scale industrial production.
Zhang et al. [174] prepared NEPCMs with octadecane as the core in poly (2,3,4,5,6- pentafluorostyrene) shell by the suspension polymerization. The prepared NEPCMs have high thermal properties, which would trigger its great application in thermal energy storage. Paraffin droplets were encapsulated into NEPCMs by in-situ polymerization with tetraethyl orthosilicate as the precursor for in-situ hydrolysis and polycondensation [175]. The encapsulation ratio and encapsulation efficiency of the prepared NEPCMs are 92.9 % and 90.24 %, and the latent heats of melting and solidification are 173.79 and 158.93 J/g, respectively.
Yuan et al. [176] prepared SA/SiO2 nano-capsules by sol-gel method. From Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) analysis, NEPCMs emerge perfect spherical structure, good energy storage capacity and thermal stability. After 3000 thermal cycles, the latent heat is 169.4 J/g, which only reduces by 5.2 J/g.
3.2.3. Micro-encapsulated PCM
Huo et al. [167] prepared MEPCMs through in-situ polymerization by using PW as the core material and urea-formaldehyde resin as the shell material. The particle sizes of phase change capsules are uniform. Compared with pure PW, the latent heat lifts to 103.2 J/g, and the energy storage and temperature regulation ability significantly lift. In addition, the MEPCM has good thermal stability and thermal reliability, and the thermal mass loss below 200 °C is <1.0 %.
MEPCMs with perfect spherical structure and core-shell structure were prepared [177], which were composed of melamine-formaldehyde polymer shell coated with biobased n-dodecanoic acid. The prepared microcapsules exhibit a high thermal energy storage capability of 99.3 %, and they melt at 41.8 °C with a decent enthalpy of 41.7 kJ/kg. MEPCMs are thermally stable up to 165.02 °C, which are also detected to be leak-proof well above the phase transition temperature. Furthermore, the thermal reliability of the MEPCMs is good after 1000 thermal cycles.
Huo et al. [178] prepared MEPCMs with the particle diameter of 2.664 μm by taking paraffin as the core material and urea-formaldehyde resin as the shell material based on in-situ polymerization method. The MEPCMs possess good phase change performance, high thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties and hydrophilicity compared with the paraffin.
Liu et al. [162] realized the in-situ encapsulation of PCMs by means of the synergistic effect of PMMA and nano-TiO2. The latent heat is 102.5 J/g, and the thermal conductivity is twice as high as that of pure paraffin.
MEPCMs composed of liquid metal Sn-Bi-In core and PMMA shell were fabricated via the liquid phase micro-encapsulation method [179]. The MEPCMs maintain good morphology and efficient thermal storage capacity (246.46 J/cm3) after 300 thermal cycles that is about 97.12 % before the cycle (253.77 J/cm3).
To sum up, the synthesis of MEPCMs has been pretty mature encapsulation technology, and the MEPCMs prepared by various methods tend to be diversified in shape structure, size, properties and composition.
3.2.4. Nano-encapsulated PCM
NEPCMs are the the further development of MEPCMs, which not only retain the technical merits of MEPCMs, but also have the merits such as small capsule size and high specific surface area compared with MEPCMs, which are beneficial to further improve the heat transfer of the materials [146,180,181]. In addition, NEPCMs could be used in fluid to improve the mobility of fluid [182], and they could be favorable to improve the dispersibility of materials [183].
Based on the sol-gel method, a nano-encapsulated inorganic PCM was synthesized from taking Na2HPO4·12H2O as PCMs and silica as the shell materials [184]. The melting temperature of NEPCMs is 51 °C, and the latent heat is 111.69 kJ/kg. PA/SiO2 NEPCMs were prepared by sol-gel method [185]. With elevating the pH value from 11 to 12, the encapsulation rate of PA/SiO2 NEPCMs increases from 83.25 % to 89.55 %. Compared with pure PA, the prepared PA/SiO2 NEPCMs have good thermal performance, chemical stability, and uniform morphology.
NEPCMs were fabricated with n-tetradecane as core material and urea-formaldehyde polymerization as shell materials by in-situ polymerization [186]. The size of NEPCMs is about 100 nm, and the core material is well encapsulated. The mass content of n-tetradecane is up to 60 % and the latent heat is 134.16 kJ/kg.
Palazzo and Reverchon [187] examined the encapsulation performance of NEPCMs synthesized with SA and isopropyl myristate in PMMA shell by supercritical emulsion extraction. The mean diameters of spherical NEPCMs with smooth surface are between 163 and 431 nm. The NEPCMs have better encapsulation performance with an encapsulation efficiency of 91 %.
As stated above, the stable composite PCMs have high thermal conductivity and phase change temperature tunability compared with pure PCMs, but would compromise in thermal stability. Micro/nano encapsulation technology are helpful to further promote the thermal stability and thermal cycling performance of PCMs, and prevent PCMs from leaking. It is also essential to seek an optimized modification method by considering the cost of various modification methods along with the properties of modified PCMs.
4. PCMs for BTMSs
4.1. Thermal management systems of battery
Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles because of their high energy density, light weight, no radiation and low self-discharge rate [[188], [189], [190]]. Lithium-ion battery is the main energy storage device of electric vehicles, which would directly affect the performance of the vehicle. The optimum working temperatures of lithium batteries are between 15 and 40 °C [191,192], since the battery at the optimum temperatures has higher charging and discharging efficiency and greater energy density, which would be favorable for keeping longer driving range and stronger power output [12,193]. Therefore, building an efficient BTMS is crucial to well control the operating temperature of the battery, and slow down its aging rate, as well as extend the service life of the battery [194,195].
The function of BTMSs mainly includes cooling, heating and temperature equalization. The temperature equalization refers to reducing the temperature difference within the battery pack to prevent the rapid decay caused by local overheating in the battery [24,196,197]. The cooling and heating are mainly to adjust the battery temperature according to the possible influence of the external environment on the battery.
According to whether the input energy is required in thermal management, BTMSs are usually classified into active cooling system, passive cooling system and hybrid system, as given in Fig. 6. Among them, the active cooling needs to consume external energy, including forced air cooling and liquid cooling [198], while the passive cooling does not consume extra energy, such as natural air cooling, PCM cooling and heat pipe (HP) cooling [199]. Hybrid cooling BTMSs are usually composed of two systems, which can be active-active cooling, passive-passive cooling, and active-passive cooling combinations [200,201].

Fig. 6. The classification of BTMSs.

4.1.1. Active cooling system
The active forced air cooling systems are developed to strengthen the air flow and remove excessive heat through the blowers. In order to effectively utilize air-cooling in BTMSs, versatile modificating precautions have been put forward by adding air channels or changing the battery layout to enhance the heat dissipation and thermal performance of the batteries [[202], [203], [204]]. But in the active forced air cooling, high noise could emerge, and high energy consumption is required, which would restrict it to be widely applied [13,205].
In addition, the liquid cooling systems with water, oil, ethylene glycol, nano-fluid, etc. are proposed to overcome the poor performance of air cooling system at higher temperature [198,201]. Liquid cooling is efficiently applied to BTMSs by adding liquid cooling plates with fins and grooves or changing the liquid cooling medium [[206], [207], [208], [209]]. However, the liquid cooling could result in system complexity, high cost and easy leakage, which would hinder its wide application [[210], [211], [212]].
4.1.2. Passive cooling system
The passive cooling system removes the heat in the battery by the surrounding environment or cooling medium, which is of compact structure, less complexity, safety, affordable price and long service life [14,213,214]. The passive BTMSs usually include PCM and HP, as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. (a) PCM cooling [215] (b) The working principle of HPs [216].

In the BTMSs based on PCM cooling, PCM arranged around the battery absorbs the heat of the battery pack through solid-liquid phase change to cool the battery [215]. HP is closely contacted around the battery, and the working medium inside it effectively absorbs the heat of the battery through gas-liquid phase change and flow [216]. The performance of the passive cooling system with HP is mainly related to HP types [217] and materials [218].
4.1.3. Hybrid cooling system
Hybrid cooling BTMS is also one of the research hotspots at present [[219], [220], [221]]. Yang et al. [222] proposed a hybrid liquid cooling system with parallel cooling channels and PCM/aluminum foam composites. Compared with the system without composites, the weight of the hybrid system significantly reduces, and the pump power comes back by >50 % to ensure the same heat dissipation. Feng et al. [223] constructed a hybrid PCM-HP cooling system, and compared with the thermal performance of battery based on air cooling. The maximum temperature of the battery by air cooling is 70 °C, while PCM-HP cooling reduces the temperature of the battery by 22 °C. In addition, the HP could help dissipate the heat accumulated in PCM, since the maximum temperature of the battery based on PCM-HP cooling is 10 °C lower than that of the battery by PCM cooling alone. Liu et al. [224] proposed a BTMS by combining PCM/copper foam with spiral liquid channel, as seen in Fig. 8. The spiral channel would be favorable to increase the contact area between fluid therein with PCM/copper foam, effectively releasing the latent heat of PCM.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

According to numerical simulation, Yao et al. [220] stated that a hybrid BTMS combined with PCM and cobweb liquid cooling channel has good heat dissipation performance. Compared with pure PCM cooling, the hybrid BTMS could keep the maximum temperature of battery below 40 °C. At the discharge rate of 5C, the maximum temperature and the temperature difference of the battery could be controlled at 39.6 °C and 4.9 °C, respectively. Through experiments and numerical simulation, a hybrid BTMS with PCMs and liquid cooling was designed for cylindrical Lithium-ion batteries [221]. At the ambient temperature of 35 °C and the charge-discharge rate of 1C, the maximum temperature and temperature difference of the battery without hybrid BTMS are 57.6 °C and 4.1 °C, respectively, while the maximum temperature of the battery cooled by the hybrid BTMS is 44.8 °C, and the maximum temperature difference is <2 °C.
From a numerical investigation, a hybrid BTMS by air cooling combined with PCMs cooling was addressed to improve the cooling efficiency at low power consumption rate [205]. Compared with the traditional air cooling system, the maximum temperature of the battery with the hybrid BTMS goes down by 12.0 K, and the temperature distribution uniformity of the battery prompts by about 44 % at the inlet wind speed reduced by 90 %. In addition, compared with the inlet wind speed of 1.5 m/s, the maximum temperature is still controlled at 313.13 K by cutting the inlet speed by 66.7 %, which is far below the critical limit of battery, while power consumption rate reduces by 65.8 %. Yu et al. [225] pointed out that the battery pack with air cooling channel could reduce the weight of PCM, and accelerate the regeneration of PCM, and has good thermal management effect of battery, which is beneficial to the endurance of electric vehicles. When the wind speed is 30 km/h, the maximum temperature of the battery is 43.0 °C, which is 3.9 °C lower than that of the battery cooled only by PCM, and the higher the wind speed, the lower the surface temperature of the battery. When the battery is completely discharged, in the natural state, the surface temperature of the battery could be reduced to 35 °C in only 80 min.
The thermal performance of a hybrid BTMS with PCM and air cooling system was investigated for single battery and battery packs [226]. By the hybrid BTMS, PCM continuously takes away the heat of the battery, and air could take away the heat absorbed by PCM quickly, which would be helpful to improve the performance of the battery. With the thicknesses of PCM of 5, 10, 12 and 15 mm, the final battery surface temperatures are 30.53 °C, 29.97 °C, 29.71 °C and 29.93 °C, respectively. During the discharge process, the battery temperature rises slowly under the synergistic effect of air and PCM, which is 30.6 °C. According to numerical simulation, Ahmad et al. [227] proposed a hybrid BTMS with metal fin reinforced PCM system coupled with air cooling. The cooling performance of the hybrid BTMS is better than PCM cooling or air cooling alone, and the maximum battery temperatures decrease by 18.6 % and 3.2 % respectively. Embedded heat sink could improve the heat dissipation of battery and PCM, and increasing the air speed could urge recovering PCM latent heat.
4.2. Battery heat generation
4.2.1. Battery thermal trouble
Temperature plays a crucial role in the operation, safety and life of Lithium-ion battery. The external temperature is usually known as the ambient temperature, while the internal temperature is caused by the internal heat generated by the charging and discharging operation at a faster rate in the high current [228]. It is worth noting that high internal temperatures would lead to the power and capacity degradation of Lithium-ion batteries [229,230], which could be related to high thermal resistance existed at constant ambient temperature.
The triggering factors of battery TR at high temperature are associated with mechanical abuse, electrical abuse and thermal abuse [25], as shown in Fig. 9. Although the principles and consequences of three trigger mechanisms are different, they are all caused by the rapid accumulation of a large amount of heat in a short time. In addition, the secondary influencing factors such as battery charging state, battery aging and environmental temperature would also result in the occurrence of TR [231].

Fig. 9. Triggering factors of battery TR.

Zhang et al. [232] established a TR model to describe the internal thermal characteristics of Lithium-ion batteries, and proposed the trigger energy as a key index to evaluate and characterize TR under different thermal abuse conditions. The greater the number and thickness of battery cells, the faster the spread of TR. They also carried out an experimental investigation, and stated that the ratio of self-heating trigger energy to total self-heating generated energy is consistent in adiabatic environment, and the average ratio is 24.5 %, indicating that most of the energy (generally 80 %) of Lithium-ion battery stems from the internal exothermic reaction. Galushkin et al. [233] experimentally proved that there are three kinds of exothermic reactions that determine TR process of Lithium-ion batteries. The first major exothermic reaction of TR is the release reaction of electrochemical energy accumulated in Lithium-ion batteries during charging. The second main exothermic reaction of TR is the lithiation reaction on the surface of cathode active material, which occurs by lithium atoms from the inner layers of anode and cathode active materials. The third main exothermic reaction of TR is the decomposition of cathode metal oxide and oxidation of electrolyte by released oxygen. In addition, the decrease of the open circuit voltage of the battery during TR is mainly due to the lithiation of the cathode active material.
Zhang et al. [234] conducted experiments on TR propagation at the battery system, in terms of temperature, voltage, gas and pressure in the process of TR propagation in the battery system from multiple angles. In addition, based on the heat transfer principle, a 3D TR propagation model of battery packs was established. The model has high simulation accuracy and could effectively capture the heat propagation trend inside the module. Xiao et al. [235] designed an integral cooling system with CPCM and liquid cooling for battery packs, and estimated the influence of battery spacing, thermal conductivity of CPCM, coolant flow rate and other factors on the safety performance of TR propagation of battery packs. At the coolant flow rate of 0.029 m/s, the propagation time of TR through the cooling plate is 32.9 s, which is 1.84 times longer than that of 0.009 m/s. The increase of battery spacing delays the propagation of TR and changes the propagation path of TR. Reducing the thermal conductivity of CPCM could delay the spread of TR, because heat is concentrated in the periphery of the battery, which is hard to transfer through CPCM and cooling plate. Xu et al. [236] compared the TR propagation behavior and gas production characteristics of Lithium-ion batteries under different state of charge (SOC) in a closed space. The TR in battery module does not emerge if the SOC is lower than 25 %. With the decrease of SOC, the internal heat propagation speed and surface temperature of Lithium-ion batteries all decrease. The main gases produced by TR are CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and C2H4. With the decrease of SOC, CO2 increases, while C2H4 and CO decrease, and H2 and CH4 remain unchanged.
By means of adiabatic TR experiments, the critical conditions for TR of the battery were scrutinized [237]. The critical TR temperature of the cell is logarithmically related to the heat transfer coefficient, and the heating power is inversely proportional to the time required to trigger TR in the heated cell. The critical temperature at which TR occurs in the battery is 125 °C, and the critical energy required to trigger TR is 122.76 kJ. TR propagation characteristics of cyclic aging battery modules were addressed in series, parallel and series-parallel modes [238]. The parallel mode has the highest TR temperature at 720 °C, followed by the series and series-parallel with 683 °C and 669 °C, respectively. The parallel mode also urges the fastest propagation rate of TR, which is further intensified by cyclic aging.
4.2.2. Battery heat generation model
The heat generation of Lithium-ion batteries is mainly induced by lithium ion migration and electrochemical reaction between anode and cathode during charging and discharging. The generation of heat would lead to the increase of the temperature of Lithium-ion batteries, which would further affect their performance and life [19,239]. Therefore, it is very important to seek the heat generation mechanism of Lithium-ion batteries for optimizing BTMSs.
The heat generated by Lithium-ion batteries includes reversible heat and irreversible heat. Reversible heat refers to the heat stemed by electrochemical reaction during the charging and discharging of Lithium-ion batteries [240], and the temperature of Lithium-ion batteries could be recovered by control the electrochemical reaction. Irreversible heat refers to the heat derived from internal impedance, electrode polarization and electrolyte loss during the electrochemical reaction process, which is an inevitable heat loss. Irreversible heat would lead to a prompt in the internal temperature of Lithium-ion batteries, which could weaken their performance and life [241].
In order to better understand and predict the thermal characteristics of Lithium-ion batteries, researchers have developed various thermal models. The models are based on the basic thermal equations such as heat conduction, convection heat transfer and radiation heat transfer, and combined with the internal structure and material characteristics of Lithium-ion batteries to estimate the temperature distribution and heat generation of Lithium-ion batteries [27,242]. Through the models, more effective cooling systems and thermal management strategies could be developed to ensure that Lithium-ion batteries operate in a safe temperature range.
The local heat generation modeling of Lithium-ion batteries is usually defined by [243]:
(3)
where Qirr, Qrev, Qohm,s, Qohm,e are respectively irreversible heat, reversible heat, ohmic heat generated by solid phase, and ohmic heat generated by electrolyte phase.
Based on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) for sub-scale electrochemical modeling, 3D thermal modelings were built for a single Lithium-ion battery and a 50 V Lithium-ion battery pack composed of 14 prismatic batteries [244]. The thermal model based on ECM not only accurately captures the temperature distribution of the battery, but also captures the electrochemical characteristics such as electrode potential and battery voltage. The modelings provide highly resolved temporal 3D insight into thermal and battery dynamics under fast discharging and abusive condition. An improved equivalent circuit coupled 3D thermal model, known as multi-zone heat generation and thermal resistance model (MPH-TR), was applied to cylindrical Lithium-ion batteries to optimize BTMSs [245]. The model's validity is realized through extensive comparison with experimental data across various operating conditions (pre-conditioning, fast charge, slow charge, dynamic electrical cycle). Compared with the common cylindrical method, the MPH-TR model has higher accuracy and facilitates deeper insights to the temperature distribution inside the battery.
To solve the problems of high complexity and low accuracy in modeling and characterization of dynamic non-uniform thermal characteristics of the pouch batteries, Liu et al. [246] constructed a dynamic non-uniform heat generation model. Compared with the experimental values, the average error under the condition of constant current discharge is <1 °C, and the relative error under the condition of dynamic current is <3 %. The model could accurately estimate the dynamic non-uniform heat generation distribution of pouch Lithium-ion batteries.
Li et al. [247] evaluated the heat generation and heat sources of 18,650 NCM811 battery by both the isothermal calorimetry test and calculation based on modified Bernardi model, respectively. The irreversible heat plays a key role among the heat sources with the proportions between 76.33 and 96.65 % regarding different charging/discharging, in which the ohmic heat contributes the most heat generation. Meanwhile, the reversible heat accounts for 3.25–23.67 %. Katrasnik et al. [248] developed a multi-scale model to describe how nanoscopic transport processes inside a battery cell and the resulting heat generation could lead to TR. The multi-scale coupling model between nanoscopic and macroscopic interactions well depicts performance of the battery and the degradation of intra-cell phenomena.
In conclusion, comprehensively understanding the heat generation model of the battery and rationally designing PCM cooling battery system could effectively prevent the occurrence of battery thermal trouble and improve the safety and performance of the battery.
4.3. The design of PCMs for BTMSs
In order to design PCMs for BTMSs, the following principles should be obeyed.
PCM for BTMSs should have high adaptability of phase change temperature. The phase change temperature of PCM should be within the operating range of the battery application to ensure effective absorption or release of heat under different working conditions [249,250]. Airo Farulla et al. [251] examined the temperature change of the battery at operating temperature of 45 °C and charging and discharging current of 69–92 A using the bio-based PCM with melting temperature of 40 °C. Compared with the natural cooling, the maximum temperature of the battery with the bio-based PCMs falls by 11 °C.
High latent heat storage capacity of PCMs is essential, since the high latent heat storage capacity means that the PCM could store a large amount of heat in a relatively small mass or volume, which would be favorable for keeping an efficient temperature regulation capability for the BTMSs [12,252]. Ma et al. [253] prepared a CPCM with latent heat of 205 J/g by adding nano‑copper particles, which were applied to BTMS. In the discharge tests at 1C and 2C, the maximum temperature decreases by 2.6 °C and 7.2 °C, respectively, compared with that without nano‑copper particles. The cooling effect with high discharging rate is more better. In the process of multiple charge and discharge cycles, although the latent heat of CPCM is limited, it could be effectively recovered during the pause time, which would feed a guiding strategy for the design of BTMSs.
Good thermal conductivity for PCMs facilitate the rapid transmission and distribution of heat during phase change, which would be helpful to prompt the heat dissipation speed and heat transfer efficiency of the BTMSs [214,254]. A high thermal conductivity and anti-leakage CPCM was designed and prepared including PEG, nano-Ag particles modified diatomite and EG [255]. The CPCM exhibits high thermal conductivity with 1.91 W·m−1·K−1. In addition, the temperature performance of the battery module using CPCM was examined. The CPCM could keep the battery below 53 °C, and even when the discharge rate is 3C, the temperature difference of the CPCM battery module could be effectively controlled within 5 °C after 10 cycles. Niu et al. [256] prepared CPCM with high thermal conductivity based on EG and boron nitride (BN). Compared with pure PCMs, the thermal conductivity of CPCM ramps up by about 200 %, which is 0.6011 W/(m·K). From experimental investigation of simulated battery heating, the thermal management efficiency of CPCM is much higher than that of pure PCMs. At the end of heating, the surface temperature of the battery module with CPCM is 5.12 °C lower than that with pure PCMs.
PCMs should have stable chemical properties, and would not decompose, deteriorate or other adverse reactions during long-term using, in order to ensure the reliability and safety of BTMSs [193,214]. And PCMs should be non-toxic, non-corrosive and harmless to the battery and the surrounding environment to ensure the environmental protection and sustainability of the system [197,257].
The design of PCMs should depend on its cost and availability to ensure that BTMSs are economical and practical, and the material supply is stable and reliable. The phase change process should be reversible, without supercooling and precipitation in order to ensure the long-term stable operation of BTMS [243,258]. The volume change in the phase change process should be as small as possible to avoid adverse effects on the structure and performance of BTMSs and ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
To sum up, the design of PCMs in BTMSs should be based on considering many factors stated above to realize the efficient, safe and reliable operation of the system.
4.4. Application of PCMs in BTMSs
Just as mentioned above, PCMs in BTMSs should have a wide application temperature range, which could keep the battery temperature in the optimal working temperature range during the phase change process [259,260], and the higher latent heat could be helpful to effectively improve the performance of BTMSs. Al Hallaj and Selman [261] were the first to apply PCMs to the heat dissipation of battery packs. They noted that PCM could improve the overall energy efficiency of the battery system.
Compared with other PCMs, solid-liquid PCMs are more popular because of their low volume change rate and readily control [20,262,263]. Compared with inorganic PCMs, organic PCMs have higher latent heat and no supercooling. In recent years, there are more and more investigations on the application of organic PCMs such as PW in battery cooling. Yu et al. [225] evaluated the heat generation characteristics of Lithium-ion battery with paraffin applied to BTMS, and concluded that the surface temperature of the battery declines to 46.9 °C by adding paraffin. Wilke et al. [264] employed a solid-liquid phase change composite (graphite matrix) to prevent the spread of TR in a single battery, and inferred that the maximum temperature of adjacent batteries decreases by nearly 60 °C, well preventing the TR spread. Bais et al. [265] wrapped RT-47 paraffin PCM with a thickness of 4 mm located on the core of 1.2 Ah and 3.7 V Lithium-ion battery. The temperature of the battery is better maintained by RT-47 paraffin BTMS under the same load condition, and the duration of the battery is about twice as long as that of the bare battery.
The application of non-paraffin organic PCMs in battery cooling has also attracted more attention. Through numerical simulation,Verma et al. [266] determined the cooling effect under two environmental conditions of 294 K and 323 K by serving CA with different thicknesses (3 mm, 7 mm, 9 mm and 12 mm) into battery cooling. Compared with the traditional paraffin, the cooling effect of CA is better, and the PCMs layer with 3 mm thickness is the best one, and the highest temperature in the battery goes down to 305 K. Somasundaram et al. [267] developed a two-dimensional transient mathematical model for spirally wound cylindrical Lithium-ion batteries with or without PCMs at different constant current discharge rates. PCMs are helpful to reduce the overall temperature of the battery even at the discharge rate of 5C.
Compared with the traditional cooling, BTMSs based on PCMs could well cool the battery, and control the temperature rise of the battery, and maintain the uniformity of battery temperature distribution. However, once PCM leaks, would urge irreversible pollution to the battery environment. In addition, the thermal conductivity of most solid-liquid PCMs is low, which would hinder PCMs application in BTMSs. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize PCMs. LA/SEPS/EG composite PCMs were prepared with LA as PCMs, and styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene (SEPS) and EG as supporting materials [268], and the temperature distribution of the battery at the discharge rates of 2C/3C/4C was examined in a lab-scale setup. The battery with composite PCM always keeps below 50 °C, and the minimum temperature difference is <1 °C. A CPCM was fabricated with EG and pure PCMs [269]. The mass ratio of EG plays a role on the battery surface temperature and the effective utilization of CPCM. The addition of EG improves the thermal conductivity of PCMs, which could be favorable for further controlling the battery temperature. After adding 6 % (mass ratio) EG, the effective temperature control time of CPCM prolongs by 11 min, which is 28 % higher than that of pure PCMs.
A BTMS coupled dual PCMs [270] was designed with CPCM as the main heat dissipation material and microencapsulated phase change slurry as the latent heat recovery material. The microencapsulated phase change slurry as coolant exerts a significant effect on the battery temperature and solidification performance of CPCM at low inlet slurry speed. An encapsulated inorganic PCM (EIPCM) was synthesized by nano-encapsulation method of interfacial polymerization with Na2HPO4·12H2O as inorganic core material and silica as shell material to reduce the fire risk of PCM during battery TR [184]. The melting temperature of EIPCM is 51 °C, and the latent heat is 111.69 kJ/kg. At the high discharge rate of 3C, the peak temperature of the battery with EIPCM cooling decreases by 23.7 % from 86.6 °C to 66.1 °C, and the temperature difference is controlled within 3 °C. TR of the battery is delayed by 495 s with EIPCM, and the peak surface temperature of the battery reduces by 194 °C.
In addition, the transport of ions and the transfer of charges in the batteries slow down at low temperature, which would lead to higher energy loss of batteries. A BTMS based on PCMs was designed [271], and two preheating methods with or without PCMs at low temperature were compared through numerical simulation. At the low temperatures of 253.15 K, 263.15 K and 273.15 K, the preheating time with PCM is much shorter than that without PCM, and the temperature difference of batteries is about 1.48 K. Choi et al. [272] proposed a BTMS based on CPCMs to improve the thermal performance of batteries. At fast charging conditions, the maximum temperature of the batteries falls by 1.7 °C, while the minimum temperature difference is <2.6 °C. At the temperatures below 0 °C, the preheating time of the batteries shortens by 500 s, while the temperature difference of the batteries reduces by 4.8 °C. Zhou et al. [273] infiltrated PEG into porous polyurethane (PU) network, and then infiltrated PEG-PU into highly oriented graphite frame (HOGF) to prepare PEG-PU-HOGF with multiple shells to avoid the leakage. The PEG-PU-HOGF has good electrothermal performance (134.9 °C at 1.8 V) and high electromagnetic interference performance (>90 dB). The thermal management system with PEG-PU-HOGF could be a good option as an active preheating or passive cooling system in the BTMS.
The application of PCMs in BTMSs could be favorable to improve the thermal management, energy efficiency and stability of Lithium-ion batteries. The crucial influencing factors such as thermal performance and types, and cyling performance, ambient temperature, charge-discharge rate, battery format, cost and maintenanc of PCMs for BTMSs are summarized in Table 6.

 The low ambient temperature would reduce the capacity of the battery, thus weakening the overall performance and battery life.
Charge-discharge rate	 High charge-discharge rate would make the battery generate more heat, which may increase the risk of TR and affect the safety of the battery.	[267,268]
Battery arrangement	 The shape, size and internal structure of the battery would affect the heat generation and heat dissipation.	[283,284]
Cost and maintenance	 High performance PCM usually comes with high preparation and integration costs.	[146,180,181]
 Good maintenance could extend the life of PCMs and BTMS, and reduce repair costs and system downtime.
In summary, the selection, design and application of PCMs cooling as a promising thermal management technology for Lithium-ion battery systems require a comprehensive consideration of many factors to reap optimal performance, cost effectiveness and reliability.

PCMs in thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries contributes a promising way to improve their performance, safety and life. Through various modification techniques, PCMs could be customized to meet specific requirements in thermal regulation of the Lithium-ion battery system.
The application of PCMs in Lithium-ion batteries appears significant advantages, including high-efficiency heat dissipation, enhanced safety through temperature adjustment and prolonged cycle life by reducing thermal stress. The advances contribute to the overall optimization of battery performance and reliability.
At present, the progress of PCMs in the BTMSs faces some challenges. The heat capacity and heat release rate of PCMs should be further optimized to ensure that PCMs could quickly respond to the temperature changes of the battery. The durability and cycle stability of PCMs are pretty crucial, especially in the long-term use of batteries and multiple charging and discharging processes. In addition, the cost of PCMs are also factors restricting their wide application in BTMSs. Therefore, with the consecutive improvement of energy efficiency and thermal management requirements, PCM-based battery thermal management technology needs to be further developed.
For future work, some suggestions were detailed, as shown in Fig. 10. It is pretty vital to further study and develop PCMs modification and its integration with Lithium-ion battery system to realize its full potential. Future efforts should center on exploring new eutectic PCMs with enhanced thermal properties and various encapsulation methods to avoid leakage of PCMs. In addition, comprehensive research is needed to encounter the challenges, such as hybrid cooling BTMSs coupling active cooling with passive cooling and cost-effectiveness. The cooperation among materials scientists, battery engineers and industry stakeholders is very crucial to promote the implementation of PCM-based thermal management solutions in dynamic battery applications.
