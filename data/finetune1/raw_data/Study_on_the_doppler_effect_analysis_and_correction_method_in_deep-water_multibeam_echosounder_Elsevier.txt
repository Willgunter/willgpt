Abstract
The current analysis and correction methods of Doppler effect in the multibeam echosounder (MBES) are based on the assumption that the vessel moves at a uniform speed in the radial direction within the pulse width, which fails to adapt well to the deep-water operations with long LFM pulse transmitted. To solve this problem, this paper first analyzes the vessel motion states and concludes that the uniform acceleration assumption is applicable to the vast majority of measuring environments. Based on this assumption, the impact of the Doppler effect on LFM signal and its matched filter output is investigated. According to the signal processing characteristics of MBES, a post-estimation correction method under the uniform acceleration assumption is proposed. This method performs time shift and angle compensation on the echo arrival time and angle estimated by bottom detection respectively before homing calculation. Simulation and sea trial experiments verified the Doppler effect estimation and correction efficiency of the proposed method, in which the relative error of depth results was effectively improved by 19.2 % after the correction. Semi-physical simulation was used for comparative verification between this method and the traditional method based on the uniform speed assumption. Compared with the latter, the proposed method consistently exhibited superior correction performance in scenarios with different working depths and motion states, significantly enhancing the sounding accuracy.

1. Introduction
The multibeam echosounder (MBES), with its advantage of high-efficiency seabed mapping and capability to characterize water column and seabed sediments, is the essential equipment for seabed topography survey and marine resource exploration Cui, Liu, Fan, Ai, Ma, Yang, 2021, Hellequin, Boucher, Lurton, 2003, Philip, Denny, Solomon, Kelley, 2016. The sounding accuracy is the core index of MBES. Under severe sea conditions, the Doppler effect induced by the vessel movement is exacerbated, leading to a substantial decline in system accuracy.
The Doppler effect manifests as the broadening or compression of the original signal, which makes its frequency band shift and affects the subsequent signal processing results [Urick, 1983]. Based on this characteristic, it is possible to correct the affected signals through resampling Barazideh, Niknam, Natarajan, Nikitin, 2019, Li, Zhou, Stojanovic, Freitag, Willett, 2008, Liu, He, Kong, Liu, 2014, but this method requires a large amount of calculation and its accuracy is limited by the length of the Fourier transform window. The LFM pulse is widely used in sonar and radar due to its large time-bandwidth product, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while ensuring range resolution Pelekanakis, Bates, Tesei, 2018, Yedla, Prasad, Rao, Kumar, Rao, 2018. Reference [Kroszczynśki, 1969] analyzed the frequency mismatch in LFM pulse compression and provided the matched filter output expression. It was found that the Doppler effect introduces time shifts in the envelope peak and phase changes in the carrier, which are related to the Doppler frequency shift. Based on the characteristic that the matched filter output delays of the LFM signals with opposite frequency change rates are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction when affected by the Doppler effect, a positive-negative FM correction method is proposed [Liu et al., 2024]. This method requires alternating transmission of positive and negative FM signals, with corresponding switching of matched filters during reception, which leads to high system complexity and is suitable for the scene with little speed change. Adaptive pulse compression utilizes received signal information to calculate filter coefficients Blunt, Shackelford, Gerlach, Smith, 2009, Ning, Tian, Li, Wu, 2021, effectively addressing Doppler signal mismatch without requiring knowledge of the vessel motion states. However, the iterative calculation results in significant computational demands, and the change of phase information makes it unsuitable for the phase detection in MBES. According to the echo characteristics and signal processing flow of MBES, for the system transmitting LFM pulse, the envelope peak shift caused by the Doppler frequency offset impacts the amplitude and phase detection results. By quantifying the Doppler time shift, the differential value can be directly incorporated into the estimated time of arrival (TOA) to eliminate the effect Aguilera, Álvarez, Paredes, Moreno, 2020, Vincent, Sintès, Maussang, Lurton, Garello, 2011. Additionally, the relative motion between the transducer and the acoustic signal induces the change of the surface sound velocity. Beamforming with incorrect sound velocity results in deviation from the aimed steering angle, which can be compensated by theoretical correction before homing calculation Grzadziel, 2021, Mohammadloo, Snellen, Simons, 2018. Through the above two correction operations, which are post-estimation corrections, a better Doppler correction effect can be achieved with small computational cost. Considering the reduction in the main-to-sidelobe ratio of the output signal resulting from the pulse compression mismatch, frequency domain correction is a feasible approach with real-time performance Liu, Jin, Song, Xu, Li, 2023, Xue, 2016. Nevertheless, this method requires high accuracy of attitude data. Any discrepancy in initial frequency compensation can impact subsequent processing stages. In scenarios where bathymetric data is incomplete or sampled at a low rate, compressed sensing can be used to accurately estimate Doppler parameters from limited measured data [Zheng et al., 2024], thus reducing the demands for data acquisition. However, the reconstruction algorithms involved are characterized by high computational complexity and high sensitivity to noise. Hyperbolic frequency modulation (HFM) signal exhibits lower sensitivity to the Doppler effect, featuring excellent main-to-sidelobe ratios and high range resolution [Blachet et al., 2021]. But its inherent spectrum characteristic also brings challenges, such as higher Analog-to-Digital (A/D) sampling rate and computing power of hardware and processing chips, and increased complexity of received signal processing due to the frequency-selective fading in seawater. The envelope peak delay of the matched filter output still exists, which needs compensation to ensure accurate range measurement.
In general, post-estimation correction for time and angle is a method with more intuitive correction effect and lower engineering implementation cost. However, current theoretical analysis and correction methods are based on the assumption that the vessel moves at a uniform speed in the radial direction within the pulse duration. In the deep-water operation where long pulses are transmitted to improve SNR, the assumption of uniform speed becomes inadequate, necessitating consideration of Doppler effects induced by complex motions. In this paper, we first analyze the vessel motion states and conclude that the assumption of uniform acceleration is applicable to the vast majority of working environments. Next, we derive the influence of the Doppler effect on LFM pulse compression under this assumption and corresponding measurement errors of MBES. For comprehensive consideration of algorithm performance and system complexity, we present a post-estimation correction method that involves time shift and angle compensation for time and direction of arrival (DOA) after bottom detection. Simulation and sea trial experiments show that the proposed method possesses excellent capabilities in estimating and correcting the Doppler effect. Compared with the traditional method based on the uniform speed assumption, this method demonstrates better adaptability to the deep-water operation mode under severe sea conditions.
2. Doppler effect analysis
2.1. Motion state assumption
Deep-water MBES is primarily composed of transmitter and receiver arrays, the inertial navigation system (INS), the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and the sound velocity meter. Mills cross technique is adopted in the arrays arrangement Clarke, 2018, Lurton, 2010. The transmitter array is installed along the track, and the receiver array is installed perpendicular to the track. The overlapping projections of their beams on the seabed create beam footprints, as shown in Fig. 1. Hundreds of sounding points can be obtained within a single ping cycle, significantly enhancing measurement efficiency.

Under the influence of winds and waves, the vessel has heave and attitude variations. As shown in Fig. 2, the array motion components in the direction of signal propagation can be categorized into translation and rotation: 
 and 
 (transmitting, receiving) are translational speeds; 
 is the rotational speed of the 
th receiver array element, which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the element symmetrical about the equivalent center. Given that the rotational component has a negligible impact on sounding results Vincent, Sintès, Maussang, Lurton, Garello, 2011, Xue, 2016, this chapter will focus on the Doppler effect induced by translation including vessel travel and heave. Efforts are consistently made to maintain uniform sailing during MBES operations, but the vertical heave movement cannot be simply controlled. Thus, the following mainly analyzes the motion state of heave.

Fig. 2. Illustration of arrays movement.

The temporal variation of vessel heave is generally in a sinusoidal form [Küchler et al., 2011], and its speed can be expressed as
(1)
where 
 is the speed amplitude, 
 is the angular frequency, and 
 is the initial phase. The expansion at the start of the pulse 
 is:
(2)
where 
 is the original phase of the motion state at 
, i.e., 
; 
 is the time delay between the leading edge and a certain sampling point within the pulse, i.e., 
; 
 represents the remainder. In the analysis of the expansion, when 
, the above equation can be approximated as:
(3)
On this basis, when the heave speed at the end of the pulse 
 has
(4)
the first-order delay term can be ignored and the heave can be regarded as a uniform motion during the pulse.
Specifically, the cycle of vessel heave under severe sea conditions generally ranges from 8 to 10 s Liu, Duan, Huang, Duan, Ma, 2020, Woodacre, Bauer, Irani, 2015. When the pulse length exceeds 400 ms, variable acceleration motion should be considered, but the transmitting pulse length of MBES seldom exceeds this value 
. Within 
, uniform acceleration and uniform speed motions coexist. From Eq. (2), the trade-off of higher-order terms is related to the pulse length and the motion state at the start of the pulse. When 
 is 0, Eq. (4) is no longer valid and the first-order term cannot be ignored. It should be regarded as uniform acceleration for any pulse length within 
. From 0 to 
, the boundary between uniform speed and uniform acceleration depends on the pulse length and the motion cycle. The longer the pulse and the shorter the cycle, the smaller the proportion of periods that can be regarded as the uniform speed motion. For example, Fig. 3 shows the curve of normalized standard heave speed varying with instantaneous phase, with the heave cycle set to 8 seconds. When 
 lies outside the ranges of 
0.23 (30 ms) and 
0.67 (100 ms), the first-order term in the expansion of heave speed can be neglected, allowing the vessel to be regarded as moving at a uniform speed within the pulse. When 
 lies within these ranges, a uniform acceleration assumption is necessary.

Fig. 3. Example of two pulses with different lengths of 30 ms and 100 ms. The ranges indicated by the arrows express the periods which can take the assumption of uniform speed motion. For the parts without arrows in the middle, it is necessary to assume uniform acceleration motion.

Consequently, the vessel motion in the direction of signal propagation cannot be simply regarded as uniform speed motion. The assumption of uniform acceleration is applicable to the vast majority of MBES operation environments, while the uniform speed motion can be treated as a special case.
2.2. Doppler effect analysis under uniform acceleration assumption
In deep water, the sound ray propagates in a curve due to the variations of sound velocity in different seawater media. While in the two periods of transmission and reception, the signal propagation distances are short, allowing for the assumption that the sound velocities during transmission and reception are the constants 
 and 
 respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. Let 
 and 
 denote the propagation distances during the two periods, 
 and

 and

,

 and the time when this sampling point is received;

To determine the form of the received pulse signal, it is essential to establish the relationship between 
 and 
, that is,
(5)
We can get 
, and the received signal is compressed to 
 of the original. It can be written as 
, where 
 is the total two-way delay of signal propagation.
The expression of original LFM pulse is:
(6)
where 
 is the rectangular window function with the window length 
 and 
 is the pulse width; 
 is the angular frequency at the start of pulse; 
 is the frequency change rate within the pulse, i.e., 
 and 
 is bandwidth. The Doppler effect only affects the carrier frequency, while the envelope is almost unchanged [Wang et al., 2012]. The long pulse transmission and reception process can be divided into numerous short pulses, each experiencing different Doppler effects as the vessel moves at 
. Thus, the affected signal can be expressed as:
(7)
where 
 is the Doppler frequency offset at the start of the pulse, i.e., 
, and 
 is the center frequency. Under the assumption of uniform acceleration, the change rate of Doppler frequency offset within the pulse is 
, where 
 represents the difference in Doppler frequency offset between the start and end of the pulse, and 
 and 
 are the radial accelerations of the vessel during transmission and reception respectively.
The affected signal is processed through the original matched filter, and the output expression is derived as follows:
(8)
where 
 is composed of error functions,
(9)
(10)
(11)
and 
 is the error function, i.e., 
.
Since the expression is too complicated to give an explicit solution for the envelope peak time, an approximate solution is provided here.
(12)
When the vessel moves at a constant speed, this estimated value is the same as the solution derived under the uniform speed assumption Aguilera, Álvarez, Paredes, Moreno, 2020, Vincent, Sintès, Maussang, Lurton, Garello, 2011 :

3. Doppler effect correction method for bathymetry
The signal processing flow of deep-water MBES is illustrated in Fig. 5. First, the LFM echo undergoes spatial filtering via time-delay beamforming and then processed by the matched filter to compress the pulse width and improve SNR. During beamforming, due to the attitude variation, it is necessary to stabilize beams according to the attitude information from INS and the roll compensation technique is adopted here [Zhang et al., 2020]. Subsequently, 
 of the echo at the beam center is estimated through bottom detection, which mainly includes amplitude detection and phase detection. The amplitude detection method relies on the amplitude distribution of the signal envelope to estimate the time of the center of gravity, commonly used at small incidence angles. While the phase detection method calculates the phase difference between the two subarray outputs to estimate the zero-crossing time, commonly used at large incidence angles [Gaida et al., 2020]. Finally, combined with the corresponding 
 and the sound velocity profile, the depth and horizontal position of the sounding point can be calculated.

Specifically, the high-frequency modulated signal needs to be demodulated and down-sampled to extract the information and reduce computational load [Wu et al., 2021]. The received pulse of the 
th array element is:
(14)
where 
 is the propagation delay. Under the vessel movement, the Doppler effect signal demodulated to the baseband is:
(15)
Considering the variations of attitude angles, the time delay of the 
th array element is
(16)
where 
 is the signal propagation delay of the array equivalent center 
; 
 is the inter-element spacing; 
 reflects the change of incident angle in the carrier coordinate system caused by the variations of three attitude angles; the denominator represents the change of surface sound velocity. To achieve beam stabilization, roll compensation is performed according to the roll value 
, that is, each sampling point is delayed correspondingly by 
, where 
 is the aimed steering angle, and 
 is the surface sound velocity obtained from the surface sound velocity meter (SSVM). When all element signals are superimposed in phase, the beam pointing angle is the required 
, and the beam output reaches the maximum at this spatial azimuth. In this case, for any two elements symmetrical about 
, the terms related to the propagation delay in their phase difference exhibit:
(17)
The actual incident angle in the carrier coordinate system can be obtained as follows:
(18)
The phase of the beam output signal is consistent with its equivalent center [Vincent et al., 2011]. As analyzed in the previous chapter, the original matched filtering process introduces a time delay in the envelope peak, as Eq. (12).
For real-time frequency domain compensation, it is necessary to know the hull motion state in the propagation direction during each time interval, which requires high sampling rate and precision for the attitude sensor. In the case of transmitting long LFM pulses and considering the uniform acceleration motion, there are multiple Doppler frequency offsets within the pulse width. Furthermore, seabed echoes are continuously distributed and overlap, making precise frequency compensation challenging. To this end, we can correct the estimated results of 
 and 
 after bottom detection. Despite the differing principles of amplitude detection and phase detection, both methods estimate the 
 of the beam center echo which is at 
. Thus, the Doppler corrections for the results of the two detection methods are the same. As illustrated in Fig. 6, 
 is first corrected according to the values of the sound velocity, radial motion speed and acceleration at the moments of transmission and reception. The real 
 is then calculated based on the motion state and sound velocity at the time of 
. Finally, the sounding position is obtained through the homing algorithm. Compared to the frequency domain compensation, this method significantly reduces computing capacity and can also be used in real-time measurements.

The correction expressions are detailed as follows:
(19)
(20)
Through the analysis of the Doppler effect, several guiding recommendations are provided for the system operations in severe sea conditions. For instance, if the accuracy requirements permit, the working frequency should be minimized to reduce the influence of the Doppler effect; vessel speed should be stabilized to avoid Doppler complexity caused by speed variations; and the system filters should be designed with a sufficient frequency margin, which can be determined based on the maximum radial speed and working frequency. During the signal processing, considering different rotational motion components among array elements induced by the vessel attitude variations, which leads to different degrees of frequency mismatch in pulse compression, time-delay beamforming with attitude compensation should be performed first, and pulse compression is then applied to the beamforming output.
4. Experimental results and discussions
4.1. Verification of delay and angle correction
In the simulation verification of Eq. (8), the center frequency of the system is set to 12 kHz and LFM pulses with two sets of different parameters are simulated. It is assumed that the vessel makes uniform acceleration movements relative to the seabed. In the direction of signal propagation, the initial velocities at the start of the echoes are 2 m/s, with corresponding accelerations of 1 m/s2 and 2 m/s2, respectively. By calculating the arrival times of each sampling point of the signal, rearranging them accordingly and resampling, the echo time sequence with vessel motion information can be obtained, which represents the true value under the Doppler effect. After demodulation and pulse compression, the output envelopes in time and frequency domains are shown in Fig. 7. Compared with the original signals without vessel motion, the envelope peak times influenced by the Doppler effect are advanced, and their frequency domains exhibit noticeable shifts. The derived theoretical values from Eq. (8) show excellent consistency with true values, validating the effectiveness of the deduction.

Next, we compare and analyze the time delay estimations of Doppler effect under the assumptions of uniform speed and uniform acceleration. The initial radial speed of the vessel is set to 0 m/s, and the acceleration is 2 m/s2. The attitude angles vary sinusoidally, with the roll, pitch, and yaw set as follows:
(21)
(22)
(23)
where the attitude variation cycle 
 is 8 s. The receiver array includes 128 elements with the inter-element spacing of half-wavelength. The center frequency of the point target signal directly below is 12 kHz, and other specific parameters are detailed in Table 1. By simulating the signal propagation process and measuring the delay between the envelope peaks with and without the Doppler effect, the true value of the delay time can be obtained. In Table 1, the true delay time is compared with the estimated results derived from the two assumptions: Assumption 1 represents uniform speed assumption, and assumption 2 represents uniform acceleration assumption. For the ranging difference 
 between the true delay time and estimated value, the sound velocity 
 is taken as 1500 m/s. It can be seen that the difference in delay estimations between the two assumptions becomes increasingly pronounced as the speed variation within the pulse width grows. Specifically, longer pulse width and narrower bandwidth amplify the influence of speed change on the Doppler effect. Under these conditions, the uniform speed assumption loses its validity, while the uniform acceleration assumption demonstrates better effectiveness in estimating the envelope peak delay.

In the verification of angle correction, it is assumed that the array rotates according to Eqs. (21)–(23) and makes two kinds of uniform acceleration movements during the receiving process. The initial vertical velocities are set to 2 m/s and -2 m/s, with corresponding vertical accelerations of 2 m/s2 and -2 m/s2, respectively. The LFM pulse has a center frequency of 12 kHz, a bandwidth of 200 Hz, and a duration of 100 ms. The sound velocity is set to 1500m/s, and the echoes from different directions are beamformed at steering angles of 
 and 
 according to this sound velocity value. The spatial domain maximum can be obtained through the in-phase superposition of signals from each array element, and the corresponding angle represents 
. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the beam pointing directions deviate from the aimed steering angles due to the array motion, with the true values measured at

4.2. Comparison of results before and after doppler effect correction
We processed two overlapping reverse lines in the South China Sea under 3 level sea conditions, with water depths ranging from 600 to 900 m. System parameters are shown in Table 2, and the vessel motion data collected are shown in Fig. 9, where the time represented by the X axis is coordinated universal time (UTC). The green-shaded periods correspond to the total transmission-reception durations of the single ping sounding results in Figs. 10 and 11, and the arrival times of the central beam echos are denoted by the purple dashed-dotted lines. Let the ping from Line1 be Ping1, and the ping from Line2 be Ping2. The radial speed component of the vessel in the signal propagation direction decreases as the beam angle increases, leading to a reduction in the influence of the Doppler effect. As shown in Fig. 10, the Doppler frequency offset is most significant in the region directly below. Fig. 11 illustrates the sounding results of Ping1 and Ping2 before and after Doppler correction. In correction process, 
 and 
 were corrected by Eqs. (19) and (20), and then sent to the homing function to calculate the horizontal position and depth of the sounding point. It can be seen that the region with small beam angles exhibits significant distortions due to the existence of strong Doppler effect, while the impact gradually diminishes as the beam angle extends toward both sides. In the case of serious terrain undulation in Ping1, the error caused by the Doppler effect is minimal compared to the inherent terrain undulation.

Topographic maps before and after Doppler correction are shown in Fig. 12. Each row of subplots corresponds to the mapping results of Line1 and Line2 respectively, while columns 1 and 2 present results with and without Doppler effect correction. Observationally, the affected sounding results exhibit ripple-like distortion under rough sea conditions. The areas with small incident angles and flat topography are more susceptible to the Doppler effect. The red-shaded zones in Fig. 12 are selectively intercepted for profile analysis, as presented in Fig. 13. After Doppler effect correction, the seabed demonstrates a notable tendency toward smoothness. The mutual difference maps of the two survey lines are shown in Fig. 14. For the red-framed region with pronounced Doppler signatures, we analyzed the distributions of differences and their absolute values. The corresponding histograms are shown in Fig. 15, it can be seen that the distribution of differences without correction deviates obviously from 0, and the absolute values are distributed more in the range of 2 to 4 m, leading to an increase in the standard deviation. While the corrected values approximate a normal distribution, which is consistent with the theoretical sounding model [Lurton, 2010]. According to the statistic, after Doppler effect correction, the standard deviation of depth differences decreases from 2.09 m to 1.82 m, and the corresponding mean values are 0.24 m and 
0.02 m, respectively. The average relative depth error is reduced from 0.26 %
 to 0.21 %
, illustrating a statistically significant 19.2 % enhancement attributed to the Doppler correction.

However, the depth undulations still exist at large incidence angles, which predominately occurs in rough sea conditions. It is observed that the frequency of these undulations differs from Doppler-induced distortions, indicating that they are attributable to other factors—for instance, the reduced data density along the track, which enhances the visibility of edge noise; the impact of the bubble layer on the amplitude-phase inconsistency among array elements; and the fluctuations in the sound velocity gradient caused by internal waves and turbulence [Clarke, 2018]. Future research will focus on the calibration algorithm and signal recovery to mitigate these edge undulations.
4.3. Difference between the correction results under the two motion assumptions
To compare and verify the correction effects of the two motion assumptions, it is necessary to meet the requirements of harsh sea conditions and long pulse operation at the same time. Due to the lack of relevant measured data, we used the combination of collected vessel motion data and signal simulation to verify the proposed method. The heave and attitude data collected in 5 level sea conditions were introduced. The navigation, heave, and attitude changes were strictly simulated, and the received signals of each element were constructed on this basis. Because the simulation process involves the solution of the geometric equation formed by the movement distance of the array element and the signal propagation path, which takes a long time, several typical motion states were selected for verification. As shown in Figs. 16 and 17, the circles indicate the vessel motion states at transmitting times (set to 0), and squares indicate the motion states at each receiving time at different depths and beam angles. We set three depth scenes of 2000 m, 4000 m and 6000 m, and considered mild ocean current fluctuations. The sound velocity profile was simplified as two layers with constant values, and the ocean current layer was set to 100 m thick and located above the water body. There were weak fluctuations of sound velocity and random attenuation of sound energy in the ocean current layer, in which the sound velocity obeyed a Gaussian distribution with a mean value of 1500 m/s and a standard deviation of 0.3 m/s, and the amplitude attenuation obeyed a Gaussian distribution with a mean value of 0.3 dB/km and a standard deviation of 0.1 dB/km Honsho, Kido, Tomita, Uchida, 2019, Perez, Foltz, Lumpkin, Schmid, 2019. The outer layer was a homogeneous medium with a sound velocity of 1505 m/s. The signal simulation method is detailed in Fig. 18: First, the continuous signal is discretized, and the vessel position at the moment when each sampling point is emitted from the equivalent center of the transmitter array is calculated. The seabed is discretized, and the division method ensures that there are at least 25 scattering points in a pulse width coverage area [Fezzani et al., 2019]. Calculate the propagation time of each sampling point of the signal sent from the transmitter array, scattered by the scattering points and then received by each receiver array element, and arrange the signal points according to the receiving times. Finally, the newly constructed received signal sequences are interpolated and sampled at equal intervals, and the received signals of each element under the vessel movement are obtained. During the simulation process, it is assumed that the seafloor scattering amplitude obeys Rayleigh distribution and the phase obeys uniform distribution. The Lambert backscattering model and spherical spreading loss are taken into account [Smith, 2024]. Since the sounding accuracy is affected by multiple error sources, the input SNR of the receiver array element is set to 10 dB to emphasize the Doppler effect error. Simulation parameters are shown in Table 3.

In each of the experimental groups, the first three sounding points were processed using amplitude detection, while the remaining were processed using phase detection. The sounding results are shown in Fig. 19, and the corresponding errors are listed in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, where 
 denotes the sounding error before the Doppler correction, 
 and 
 denote the errors after the corrections based on the uniform speed and uniform acceleration assumptions, respectively. It can be seen that the Doppler effect induces varying degrees of distortion in sounding results. For some special states, such as when the sum of the radial speeds at the transmitting and receiving times approaches zero, the Doppler effect has minimal impact on the sounding accuracy. When the radial accelerations during the transmitting and receiving processes can cancel each other out, the correction results based on the uniform speed and uniform acceleration assumptions show little difference. These characteristics are consistent with the theoretical derivations of the Doppler effect. Compared with the uniform speed correction, the average error in each group were reduced by 52.6 %, 17.7 % and 44.6 % at 2000 m, 66.5 %, 42.2 % and 44.5 % at 4000 m, 50.9 %, 54.4 % and 39.6 % at 6000 m, the uniform acceleration correction method provides notably improved sounding results.

From the above verification, it is evident that the Doppler effect induced by the vessel movement significantly impacts the sounding accuracy, which is mainly affected by the translational component, while the rotational influence is negligible. The Doppler correction method proposed under the uniform acceleration assumption can effectively correct the 
 and 
 estimates, and consistently exhibits superior performance in scenarios with different working depths and motion states. Moreover, this method requires little computational effort, ensuring real-time system performance. The way of post-estimation correction facilitates the integration of higher-precision sensor data and re-correction if needed.
5. Conclusion
In deep-water operation environments characterized by long-pulse transmissions, the Doppler effect correction method under the simple uniform speed assumption no longer satisfies the accuracy requirement, necessitating consideration of more complex motion states. Through the analysis of vessel movements, it is concluded that the assumption of uniform acceleration can adapt to the vast majority of measurement environments, and a post-estimation correction method under this assumption is proposed. This method has a small computational load and can meet the real-time requirements of the system. Simulation and sea trial experiments were performed to validate the method’s correction efficiency, demonstrating its capability for Doppler effect estimation and correction. In comparative evaluations of the methods under the two assumptions, given the lack of long pulse operation data in harsh environments, we used semi-physical simulation to highlight their difference, with the vessel motion and signal propagation strictly simulated. Compared with the method under the uniform speed assumption, the proposed method can give better sounding results and greatly improve the working capacity of the system in deep-water operations. With other problems remaining to be solved, ensuring reliable performance of MBES in extremely harsh environments constitutes our main research content. Corresponding sea trials will be carried out for verification in the future.
