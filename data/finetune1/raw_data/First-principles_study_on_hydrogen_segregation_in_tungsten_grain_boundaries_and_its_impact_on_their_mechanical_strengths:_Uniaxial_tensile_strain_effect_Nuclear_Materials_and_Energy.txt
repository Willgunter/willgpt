Abstract
Based on comprehensive first-principles calculations, this study systematically investigates hydrogen (H) segregation behavior at Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] tungsten (W) grain boundaries (GBs) under uniaxial tensile strain, and its consequent impact on GB mechanical strengths. Our results indicate that the application of tensile strain significantly promotes H segregation to both pristine and vacancy-containing GBs. This behavior is mainly attributed to the reduction of the local charge density at interstitial sites, thereby revealing a possible positive correlation between H segregation energy and local charge density. Comparing the H segregation behavior at the two pristine GBs, H preferentially segregates to the Σ5(310)[100] GB due to its lower charge density. However, this tendency is influenced by the formation of vacancies in the GB, and as the number of H atoms in the vacancies increases, the segregation behavior shifts. First-principles tensile tests show that segregated H substantially reduces the ultimate tensile strength of W GBs. This embrittlement effect intensifies with increasing H concentration and is particularly pronounced when H atoms localize directly on the GB plane. Moreover, the presence of vacancy-H clusters further degrades mechanical strength, especially in the Σ5(310)[100] GB. These findings highlight the critical role of mechanical strain in accelerating H embrittlement in W, providing essential insights for designing radiation-resistant plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors.

Introduction
Nuclear fusion energy is considered one of the most effective solutions to global energy shortages, offering an environmentally responsible and renewable energy source. However, the development of key materials used in fusion reactors is a major obstacle to the widespread use of nuclear fusion energy. Tungsten (W) has been identified as one of the most promising candidates for plasma-facing materials in future fusion reactors due to its superior material properties (e.g. high melting point, high thermal diffusivity, and low deuterium/tritium retention) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. However, W is exposed to extremely high fluxes of hydrogen (H) isotopes and energetic neutrons in the irradiation environment, leading to the formation of numerous vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs). As a great number of H atoms diffuse from the surface into the material, it will cause H embrittlement and H bubble formation in W[[7], [8], [9], [10]]. As a result, plasma radiation will dramatically change the microstructure and deteriorate the mechanical properties of W material[[11], [12], [13]].
A high density of defect sinks, such as grain boundaries (GBs), is considered an effective means of mitigating irradiation damage by absorbing and annihilating point defects. A high density of defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) was considered as a segregation region to mitigate damage under irradiation. In addition to playing a critical role in the deformation behavior and ultimately in controlling the mechanical properties of many metals, GBs have been shown to have a direct effect on the absorption and annihilation of radiation-induced defects, including vacancies and SIAs[[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. However, the efficacy of GBs in enhancing radiation resistance can be significantly affected by impurities such as H.
GB H-embrittlement, known as H-induced intergranular brittleness of normal ductile materials, has been widely recognized and extensively studied in many metals. It leads to the degradation of mechanical properties, often resulting in sudden and catastrophic fracture failure [20,21]. For W specifically, several recent attempts have been made to explain the H-induced damage by researching the interplay between H and lattice defects, such as vacancies [22] and SIAs [23,24]. However, due to the complex interaction of H with W GBs, the atomic mechanisms underpinning the effect of H impurities on W GBs still remains elusive.
Furthermore, previous studies showed that the development of defect-based damage is closely related to the intense strain localization, including in slip bands and surrounding GBs [[25], [26], [27]]. Several studies examined the role of strain in deciding the segregation and diffusion behaviors of H in the bulk of W [26,27]. However, as literature work on the effect of strain on H behavior focuses on bulk W, the influence of strain on H behavior at W's GBs remains unclear. Knowing such an effect is crucial for a thorough understanding of GB's impact on W's material properties.
This study aims to directly address the aforementioned challenges by investigating the effects of H impurities on W GBs under uniaxial tensile strain. Using comprehensive first-principles calculations for two W GB models, we rigorously demonstrate how uniaxial tensile strain influences H segregation in both pristine and vacancy-containing GBs. Specifically, we investigate whether applied uniaxial strain enhances H segregation at W GBs and how the segregated H alters the structural and mechanical characteristics of the boundaries. The findings provide deeper insight into the behavior of W GBs, constituting a critical advancement in improving the mechanical performance of W under irradiation conditions.
Computational models and Methods
GB models
In this study, we investigate the segregation behavior of H at GBs and its impact on the mechanical properties of the GBs, using the Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] boundaries as examples. These two GBs have been widely used in previous atomic simulations of body-centered cubic (bcc) systems [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]], not only because they have been clearly observed experimentally [[36], [37], [38]], but also due to their well-ordered GB structures at typical fusion environment temperatures [[39], [40], [41]]. Furthermore, these two GBs possess different structural units and atomic densities, offering GB structural diversity that can be used to study how the geometry of the GB influences H segregation. Finally, these GBs have well-defined atomic configurations, enabling reliable comparisons with previous first-principles and atomic-scale studies. The GB models employed in this work are symmetric tilt GBs constructed using the coincidence site lattice (CSL) theory. To generate a symmetric tilt GB, two separate crystals are first generated by rotating the crystal lattice around the same crystallographic tilt axis. The two crystals are rotated in opposite directions, each by half of the total misorientation angle of the GB. These crystals are then cut along the GB plane and subsequently stacked to form a periodic GB structure. If any two atoms at the grain boundary are closer than a distance tolerance of 0.5 Å, one of the atoms is removed to eliminate unphysical atomic overlap. The dimensions for the Σ3(112)[1 1 0] and Σ5(310)[1 0 0] supercells are 46.95 × 8.99 × 5.47 Å containing 144 W atoms (Fig. 2(a)) and 10.02 × 40.90 × 6.32 Å containing 160 W atoms (Fig. 2(b)), respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions and thus there are two identical GBs in each biocrystal model.

First-principles calculations
The first-principles calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) framework as implemented in the VASP code [42,43] with generalized gradient approximation (GGA, PW91) according to Perdew and Wang [44,45]. The interaction between ions and electrons is described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential based on GGA [46,47]. The cutoff energy of plane-wave basis set was chosen to be 400 eV. The Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] supercells use 1 × 3 × 5 and 2 × 1 × 3 gamma centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh, respectively [48]. For all calculations in the present study, the energy relaxation iterates until the forces on each ion are less than 10-3 eV/Å. For the bulk of W, calculations were performed on the supercell (4 × 4 × 4) having 128 W atoms with a 3 × 3 × 3 gamma centered k-point mesh. The calculated equilibrium lattice constant for bcc W is 3.17 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.16 Å.
Convergence tests for the k-point mesh and cutoff energy used above were rigorously performed for the solution energy of H at interstitial sites in both the bulk and GB models, as shown in Table 1, Table 2. For the bulk model, the solution energy of H at the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) was selected as the test object, while for the GB model, the solution energy at interfacial interstitial sites (Position 1 in both GB types, Fig. 2) served as the benchmark. Critically, H solution energies at interstitial sites converge within 0.02 eV across all tested k-point meshes and energy cutoffs. Similar convergence tests have also been reported in previous studies of bcc metal systems [[49], [50], [51]]. Additionally, since Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] are widely studied as typical GBs in bcc metals, convergence test results for their supercell sizes are readily available from previous studies [23,[52], [53], [54], [55]]. We selected the largest supercell sizes reported in the literature for these two GBs as our study models to avoid issues related to supercell size.

Calculation of energetics in GB models
The GB energy (

 is the energy of commensurate W bulk supercell, and 
 is the cross-sectional area of GB in the computational cell that contains two GBs. Using Eq. (1), we calculated the 
 of the Σ5(310) and Σ3(112) GBs to be 2.2 J/m2 and 0.71 J/m2, respectively. These values are consistent with the previous DFT calculation results [53] and also agrees well with the reported experimental observations in W GBs [38,56,57].
The ability of H to segregate at GBs is typically evaluated using the segregation energy (

 are the total energies of W bulk supercell with and without H, respectively. The total energy of the W bulk supercell (
) was evaluated using a 4 × 4 × 4 body-centered cubic (bcc) structure containing 128 W atoms. Moreover, since H is energetically more stable at tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) than at other interstitial positions in bulk W [62], the total energy of the W-H supercell with H occupying a TIS was used as 
. Here, a negative segregation energy suggests that H preferentially segregates to GBs, whereas a positive value indicates that the segregation is energetically unfavorable.

First-principles calculation tensile tests
The first-principles calculation tensile test (FPCTT) is an effective method for investigating the mechanical properties of materials, particularly the embrittlement behavior of GBs induced by impurity precipitation and intrinsic defects. To perform the FPCTT on two GBs, we first obtained the equilibrium structures of the Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] GBs. As shown in Fig. 1, we divide the supercell into two functional regions: the tensile testing region (hatched area) and the loading region (blue area). For the two GB supercell structures examined in this work, these regions are delineated by blue dashed lines in Fig. 2. The atomic layers located inside the dashed lines—including those on which the dashed lines lie—are designated as the tensile testing region, whereas the layers outside the dashed lines are assigned to the loading region. We fix the atomic layers on both sides of the GB model as the loading region to ensure that both regions share an identical in-plane orientation, thereby providing a seamless and physically consistent transition between them. This model-construction approach is widely adopted and regarded as highly reliable in first-principles investigations of GB tensile deformation [[63], [64], [65]].
During the FPCTT, we separated the GBs from layer 0 to layer 1 to create a cracked surface. The atoms in the loading regions are fixed during the FPCTTs. Then, we moved the two loading regions in the opposite directions perpendicular to the GB. The length of the testing region between the two loading regions is denoted as d (with d0 as the initial length), which changes according to the applied strain. After each application of uniaxial tensile strain, we allow full atomic relaxations for the atoms in the testing region. Therefore, the FPCTTs were performed under static strain. It is noted that Poisson's ratio is not considered in the FPCTT. A series of tensile tests on the two W GBs were performed. Finally, we can obtain the tensile stress–strain curve using d and the corresponding energy difference.
Based on our testing approach, the energy difference per unit area 
 is
(5)
where E(d) is the total energy of the GB model for the separation distance d, E(d0) is the total energy of the equilibrium model before loading, and SGB is the area of the GB plane.
The uniaxial tensile strain ε(d) is defined as
(6)
where d0 is the initial length of the testing region. The distance between the two loading regions is d, and d will change with the applied strain.
The Hellmann-Feynman theorem is used to determine tensile stress through the Nielsen-Martin scheme [66]. The tensile stress σ(d) can be calculated as

H segregation in W GBs under different strains
Effect of uniaxial tensile strain on H segregation energy in W GBs without vacancies
In a fusion environment, high temperatures and high-energy neutron irradiation induce mechanical strain in W, which can accumulate at the GBs, creating regions of higher strain near the boundaries. Here, the uniaxial tensile strain is introduced to study its effects on the segregation of H in W GBs without vacancies. The H segregation energy was calculated for various interstitial positions selected in Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] GBs (Fig. 1) using Eq. (2). It is noted that both of these two GBs have not been fractured until the applied uniaxial tensile strain reaches 10 %. The segregation energy of H at the selected interstitial sites was calculated under various strains prior to GB fracture.
The segregation energy of H first increases and then reaches a plateau with the H position changing from 1 to 5 (Fig. 3(a)) when no strain is applied to the Σ3(112)[110] GB. This indicates that H atoms tend to segregate to the GB from the bulk of W. Furthermore, as the applied strain increases from 0 % to 10 %, the segregation energy of H at each interstitial position decreases, demonstrating that uniaxial tensile strain promotes the segregation of H atoms at interstitial sites of the Σ3(112)[110] GB (Fig. 2(a)).

To explore the physical mechanism underlying the effects of uniaxial strain on H segregation energy at interstitial positions in the Σ3(112)[110] GB, we analyzed the charge density at all interstitial positions after structure optimization under different uniaxial tensile strain conditions, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The results show that the trend of the charge density changing with interstitial sites is consistent with that of the segregation energy of H changing with interstitial sites when no strain was applied. As the applied uniaxial tensile strain increases, the charge density at each H interstitial position decreases, and the trend of variation with position remains consistent with that observed without strain. Overall, the segregation energy of H at the GB correlates positively with the charge density, i.e., the higher the charge density, the higher the segregation energy. This indicates that the charge density at interstitial positions plays an important role in determining the H segregation energy at the GB. In order to clearly observe the variation of charge density at the H interstitial positions at the GB, we plotted the charge density maps for positions 1 and 4 in Fig. 4. It is evident to see from Fig. 4 that the charge density at both interstitial positions decreases as the applied uniaxial tensile strain increases. Additionally, the charge density near the GB (position 1) is lower than that at a more distant position (position 4), which agrees with the results in Fig. 3(b).

Similar calculations were conducted to determine the segregation energy of H at different interstitial positions near the Σ5(310)[100] GB under uniaxial tensile strain loading from 0 % to 10 %. As shown in Fig. 5(a), for any fixed strain between 0 % and 10 %, the H segregation energy increases initially and then plateaus as the H position shifts from 1 to 6. Additionally, at each interstitial position, the segregation energy of H decreases with increasing uniaxial tensile strain (consistent with Σ3(112)[110] GB). Furthermore, it is clear to note that as the uniaxial tensile strain increases, the influence of the GB on H segregation energy increases. For example, when no strain is applied, the segregation energy of H reaches equilibrium from interstitial position 3 onwards. However, under 10 % uniaxial strain, the segregation energy of H remains nearly constant until interstitial position 4. This suggests that for the Σ5(310)[100] GB, applying uniaxial strain not only promotes the precipitation of H at the GB interstitial positions but also enlarges the range of the GB's influence on H segregation. However, this phenomenon does not occur at the Σ3(112)[110] GB.

To further investigate the physical mechanism by which uniaxial strain affects H segregation energy at interstitial sites in the Σ5(310)[100] GB, we present the charge density at H positions under various tensile conditions (Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 6). It is evident that the trend of charge density variation at the H interstitial positions corresponds to the trend of H segregation energy at these positions. This indicates that charge density at the interstitial sites in the Σ5(310)[100] GB is a dominant factor determining H segregation energy at these positions. Uniaxial strain from tensile deformation enlarges the interstitial space, reduces local charge density, and consequently lowers H segregation energy at these positions.

For both of Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] GBs, our calculation results reveal that the H segregation energy at the interstitial sites near the GB plane is lower than that at the interstitial sites farther from the GB plane, and both decrease with increasing uniaxial tensile strain. The charge density of the interstitial site where H atoms are located near the GB is an important factor affecting the H segregation energy. Our findings suggest that H tends to segregate towards both types of GBs, and this propensity increases with increasing tensile strain. Although our calculations focus on these two W GBs, this segregation pattern should also apply to other W GBs. This is because all the GBs with more space can provide the favorable segregation energy for H.
Effect of uniaxial tensile strain on the H segregation energy in W GBs with a vacancy
Vacancies have a strong attraction for H atoms in metals, and thus can be regarded as the trapping centers for H atoms [7,67]. Previous studies have shown that both vacancies and H tend to segregate at the GBs, resulting in the accumulation of H and vacancies within the GBs [29,32,63,68,69]. However, the segregation behavior of H in vacancies at the GB remains unclear, particularly under strain conditions. To clarify this behavior, H atoms were sequentially introduced into the vacancy sites at the GB, and the structures were fully relaxed at each step to obtain the most stable vacancy-H cluster configurations.
We have calculated the segregation energy of H in the monovacancy at the interface of two types of GBs using Eq. (4). As shown in Fig. 7, the segregation energy of H in the monovacancy increases as the number of H atoms increases from 1 to 4 for both of Σ5(310)[100] and Σ3(112)[110] GBs at all given strain points. We also observe a strong positional orientation in hydrogen (H) segregation within the monovacancy. As shown in Fig. 8, when the first H atom enters the monovacancy, it will automatically search the most stable position in the monovacancy. The H atom does not stay at the center of the monovacancy (the position with the lowest charge density) but prefers to reside at the monovacancy boundary on the GB plane. When the second H atom enters the monovacancy, since the most stable position has already been occupied by the first H atom, it can only stay at a sub-stable position. This is also the same case when the third and fourth H atoms enter the monovacancy. As the number of hydrogen atoms in the monovacancy increases, the optimal charge density surface [23,67,70] becomes progressively filled, resulting in a continuous increase in the segregation energy of hydrogen atoms in the monovacancy. With regard to the optimal charge density mechanism of H in metals, we will provide a dedicated discussion later. In addition, for the same number of H atoms, the segregation energy of H atoms in the monovacancy at both GBs decreases with the uniaxial tensile strain increases from 0 % to 8 %, as presented in Fig. 7. This indicates that the tensile strain can promote the segregation of H in the monovacancy at GBs and make the monovacancy in the GBs further contain more H atoms, leading to the concentration increment of H atoms in GB under irradiation conditions.

Next, we analyze the effect of different GB types on H segregation behavior. For all the pristine W GBs under uniaxial tensile strain studied in our research, the H segregation energy at the Σ5(310)[100] GB is lower than that at the Σ3(112)[110] GB, because the charge density at the interstitial sites near the Σ5(310)[100] GB is lower than that near the Σ3(112)[110] GB (due to a lower atomic density). Therefore, H is more likely to segregate to the Σ5(310)[100] GB rather than the Σ3(112)[110] GB. When monovacancies are present in the GBs, we find that the first H atom preferentially segregates to the monovacancy in the Σ5(310)[100] GB rather than the Σ3(112)[110] GB, because the segregation energy of the first H atom in the monovacancy at the Σ5(310)[100] GB is −1.40 eV, compared to −1.51 eV in the monovacancy at the Σ3(112)[110] GB. However, as the number of H atoms increases, the difference in segregation energies in the monovacancies at the two GBs gradually decreases, and eventually, the segregation energy for the fourth H atom in the monovacancy at the Σ3(112)[110] GB becomes lower than that at the Σ5(310)[100] GB (with values of −1.10 eV and −0.98 eV, respectively). This indicates that the fourth H atom will preferentially segregate to the monovacancy at the Σ3(112)[110] GB. These results indicate that the tendency of H to segregate at different GBs changes as the number of H in the monovacancies at the GBs increases.
H impurity effect on tensile strengths of W GBs
Effect of interstitial H on tensile strengths of GBs in W
Subsequently, the effect of H impurity on the tensile strength of W GBs was investigated under uniaxial tensile strain. FPCTTs were performed to obtain stress–strain curves for GBs with segregated H atoms. As shown in Fig. 9, we calculated the stress–strain curves for three different H distributions in the Σ3(112)[110] and Σ5(310)[100] GBs: 1H-GB, 4H-GB-1, and 4H-GB-2. The configurations for these three distributions are also clearly presented in the figure. The 1H-GB distribution places a single H atom at the most stable position on the GB plane. The 4H-GB-1 distribution has four H atoms occupying the four most stable interstitial sites on the GB plane. In contrast, the 4H-GB-2 distribution has four H atoms distributed near the GB.

To evaluate the influence of H segregation at W GBs on their mechanical properties, we analyzed the effects from two perspectives. We first examined the effect of the number of segregated H atoms. As shown in Fig. 9, the segregation of a single H atom at the GB has only a minor effect on its tensile strength. For instance, in the Σ5(310)[100] GB, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreases by just 0.76 GPa (from 28.76 GPa to 28.00 GPa), whereas in the Σ3(112)[110] GB, it decreases from 33.03 GPa to 31.35 GPa, i.e., the UTS of this GB decreased by 5 %. However, when four H atoms segregate at the GB (4H-GB-1), the impact on tensile strength becomes significant. In the Σ3(112)[110] GB, the UTS decreases from 33.03 GPa to 25.75 GPa, corresponding to a reduction of 7.28 GPa. While in the Σ5(310)[100] GB, the reduction in UTS is somewhat smaller, but still amounts to 2.82 GPa.
Subsequently, we investigated the effect of H segregation distribution at GBs on its tensile strength. By comparing these two distributions 4H-GB-1 and 4H-GB-2, it is evident to see that the segregation sites of H atoms exert a pronounced effect on GB tensile strengths. When H atoms concentrate on the GB plane (4H-GB-1), the GB tensile strengths deteriorate markedly; in contrast, when H atoms are uniformly distributed near the GB (4H-GB-2), the effect on tensile strengths is negligible. As shown in the previous section, our analysis of H segregation behavior revealed that the segregation energy of H is lowest at the GB plane under all applied tensile strains. Consequently, H atoms preferentially segregate at the GB plane and further should exacerbate the deterioration of GB tensile strengths.
Finally, a comparison of the stress–strain curves of these two GBs shows that both pristine GBs reach an ultimate tensile strain of 10 %, whereas the Σ3(112)[110] GB has an ultimate tensile strength 4.27 GPa higher than that of the Σ5(310)[100] GB. This difference may arise from the more compact GB structure of Σ3(112)[110] compared with Σ5(310)[100]. In addition, H segregation at the GBs exhibits a similar influence on the tensile strengths of both types of GBs. Therefore, these results may be generalized to all W GBs, i.e., H segregation reduces the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and the reduction becomes more pronounced as the H concentration increases. In particular, the segregation site of H atoms is crucial, as segregation at the GB plane causes markedly stronger degradation of GB strength.
Effect of vacancy-H clusters on tensile strength of W GBs
We also performed FPCTTs and obtained the stress–strain curves when vacancy-H clusters precipitate in GBs. As shown in Fig. 10, the stress–strain curve of 1Vacancy-1H clusters precipitated in GBs shows almost no change when compared with the case of monovacancy precipitation in both Σ5(310)[100] and Σ3(112)[110] GBs. This shows that the monovacancy plays a decisive role in the decrease of the tensile strengths of GBs, and the H in the 1Vacancy-H cluster has little effect on the tensile strengths of the GBs significantly. We then analyzed the case of 1Vacancy-4H cluster precipitation in the GB when four H atoms are segregated to the vacancy. It can be obviously seen that for Σ5(310)[100] GB, the UTS of the GB drops from 24GPa (1Vacancy precipitation in GB) to 22GPa (1Vacancy-4H precipitation in GB). For Σ3(112)[110]GB, the UTS of the GB model decreases from 32 GPa (1Vacancy precipitated in GB) to 30 GPa (1Vacancy-4H precipitated in GB). This means that the more H atoms in the monovacancy, the greater the effect on GB's tensile strengths.

We also compared the influence of segregated H on the tensile strength of the two GBs. For W GBs without vacancies and with identical H segregation, the tensile strength reduction is greater in the Σ3(112)[110] GB (7.27 GPa) than in the Σ5(310)[100] GB (3.71 GPa). When a vacancy is present without H segregation, only critical strain reduction occurs in the Σ3(112)[110] GB, whereas both tensile strength and critical strain decline markedly in the Σ5(310)[100] GB. With both a vacancy and the same H quantity at the GB, tensile strength decreases more notably in the Σ5(310)[100] GB relative to the Σ3(112)[110] GB.
Taking the Σ3(112)[110] GB as an example, Fig. 11 illustrates the evolution of charge density during the FPCTT process as the tensile strain increases. The charge density directly reflects the accumulation and depletion of electrons, which correspond to the strengthening and weakening of atomic bonds, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11(a), strong W–W atomic bonds are formed on the pristine Σ3(112)[110] GB plane, which contribute to sustaining the applied tensile stress along the loading direction. Before tensile loading, the charge density is symmetrically distributed on both sides of the GB plane. With increasing tensile strain, the charge density between W atoms along the tensile direction gradually decreases. Notably, the GB structure undergoes uniform deformation, and the charge density remains symmetrically distributed prior to GB fracture. However, when the strain reaches 12 %, the W–W bonds between the 0th and 1st GB layers break simultaneously. This observation is consistent with the turning point of the stress–strain curve for the pristine GB shown in Fig. 9(a), where fracture occurs between 10 % and 12 % strain.

As shown in Fig. 11(b), when four H atoms segregate to the interstitial sites on the Σ3(112)[110] GB plane, a noticeable weakening of charge density is observed in the W1–W3 and W5–W7 bonds. This indicates that, compared to the pristine Σ3(112)[110] GB, the segregation of H at the GB interface weakens the atomic bonding between W1–W3 and W5–W7. The underlying physical reasons can be analyzed from two aspects. First, the segregation of H at the interstitial sites exerts a mechanical compressive effect on the neighboring W atoms, leading to an increase in the bond lengths between adjacent W atoms. Second, the charge interaction between interstitial H atoms and their neighboring W atoms partially weakens the interaction between W atoms. The combined effect of these two factors results in weakened W–W bonds, which negatively impacts the mechanical strength of the GB. Similar to the pristine Σ3(112)[110] GB, the charge density on both sides of the GB plane is symmetrically distributed before tensile loading. As the GB begins to elongate, the symmetric GB structure is maintained until a strain of 12 % is reached, at which point all four H atoms move upward along with the upper half of the W atoms, forming the fracture plane. It is worth noting that before fracture, tensile strain significantly reduces the charge density at the interstitial sites near the GB, which facilitates the segregation of H towards the GB.
When 1Vacancy-4H cluster is present in the GB, as shown in Fig. 11(c), the vacancy directly disrupts the W–W bonds at the GB interface, leading to a substantial degradation of the mechanical strength of the GB (with fracture occurring at a 10 % tensile strain). Therefore, the effect of the vacancy on the GB mechanical properties is more dominant than the influence of H atoms in the cluster.
Our findings suggest that H atoms energetically favor segregation at the GB plane and near the GB interface. As a result, H-rich regions are more likely to form near the GB, and the presence of a large amount of H weakens the W–W atomic bonds at the GB interface, thereby increasing the tendency for brittle fracture along the GB. Overall, these results demonstrate that H segregation reduces the mechanical strength of W GBs, regardless of vacancy presence. For vacancy-free GBs, applied tensile strain promotes H aggregation to the GBs, and FPCTT results confirm this process reduces GB strength. In GBs containing vacancies, tensile strain drives H aggregation to vacancy sites, forming vacancy-H clusters. GB mechanical strength decreases progressively with increasing H content in the vacancy-H complexes. Furthermore, GB type significantly modulates the impact of H impurities on W GB strength.
Discussion
The above results demonstrate that the H segregation energy at GBs is strongly correlated with the local charge density. In fact, we have long been interested in the fundamental physical mechanisms governing the solution and segregation energies of H in metals. In our previous work, we proposed two mechanisms governing the behavior of H in metals: the “electron-density mechanism” and the “chemical-bonding mechanism” [71]. In transition metals, because H does not form strong chemical bonds with metal atoms, it preferentially occupies sites with optimal valence electron density, where the electron-density mechanism dominates. The interstitial sites in the W lattice exhibit relatively high valence electron density, which is much higher than the optimal electron density for hydrogen accommodation, n0 (n0≈0.018 e/Å3) [67,72,73]. Since the electron density in the W system is much higher than n0, H preferentially occupies sites with lower electron density. Due to the unique planar defect structures of GBs, the charge density near the GB plane is lower than that in the bulk, thereby driving H atoms to segregate from the bulk toward the GB. This behavior is further supported by our tensile simulations, which demonstrate that uniaxial tensile strain reduces the charge density at interstitial sites near the GB, thereby further enhancing H segregation.
Previous studies have shown that the formation of vacancies is energetically more favorable in the vicinity of W GBs than in the bulk [74]. Consequently, these pre-formed vacancies will form vacancy-H clusters when they encounter the incoming H atoms in the vicinity of GBs, while the segregation energy of H increases with the number of H atoms in the vacancy without strain but decreases with the applied strain increment. Hence, the applied tensile strain promotes the aggregation of more H atoms at GB vacancy sites, leading to the formation of a large number of vacancy-H clusters, which in turn decrease the mechanical strength of the W GB.
A small amount of impurity segregation at GBs can significantly affect the mechanical properties [65,75]. Therefore, in this study, we also examine in detail the effects of H and vacancy-H clusters on the mechanical properties of two types of W GBs. Our results show that the concentration and spatial distribution of H segregation at W GBs are two key factors determining the extent of deterioration in their mechanical properties. The closer the H segregation site is to the GB interface and the higher the concentration, the greater the impact on the mechanical properties. Our study on H segregation energy at GBs shows that the lowest segregation energy occurs at the GB interface. Therefore, energetically, H preferentially segregates to the interstitial sites at the GB interface, leading to easier formation of H clusters at the GB interface. This may explain why even low concentrations of H segregation at GBs can cause significant deterioration in mechanical properties. In addition, the segregation of vacancy-H clusters causes the UTS of the two GB models to decrease from 10 % to 8 %, highlighting the significant impact of vacancies on the mechanical properties of the GBs. In future studies, we will focus on the influence of H on vacancy formation at W GBs under strain loading conditions, which may provide new physical insights into H-induced GB embrittlement and the formation of H bubbles.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this first-principles study provides a mechanistic understanding of H segregation at W GBs under tensile strain and its detrimental effects on mechanical integrity. We demonstrate that external tensile strain acts as a driving force that promotes H segregation at both pristine and defective GBs, primarily by reducing the local charge density at interstitial sites, which consequently lowers the segregation energy. The strong dependence of H segregation on the local electronic structure highlights the critical role of charge redistribution near GBs in controlling impurity behavior.
GB vacancies serve as the deep trapping sites for H, promoting the formation of vacancy-H clusters. The applied tensile strain further stabilizes these clusters by decreasing the segregation energy of successive H atoms, leading to increased H accumulation within the GB region. This synergistic effect between strain and vacancy-mediated trapping represents a critical pathway for H embrittlement under fusion-relevant conditions.
Mechanistically, H segregation reduces W GB cohesive strength, with FPCTT data confirming this weakening effect. Strength degradation severity correlates with both H concentration and distribution: H atoms localized on the GB plane induce far greater embrittlement than those dispersed near the boundary. Additionally, the type of GB influences the extent of H-induced weakening, with the Σ5(310)[100] GB exhibiting greater sensitivity to vacancy-H complexes despite its inherently lower H segregation energy compared to the Σ3(112)[110] GB.
These findings highlight that mechanical stress in service environments, particularly those induced by thermal gradients and neutron irradiation in fusion reactors, can significantly aggravate H embrittlement in tungsten by facilitating H segregation and accumulation at GBs. Consequently, future plasma-facing component designs must account for operational stress fields alongside intrinsic GB structure optimization to suppress H-assisted failure.
