Abstract
Wind turbine blades are highly susceptible to icing in cold and humid environments, reducing power output, altering load distribution, and posing potential safety risks. While existing research has examined the icing characteristics of blade surfaces under various conditions, studies on the adhesion strength of iced blades are still insufficient. Therefore, systematic icing experiments are conducted using an icing wind tunnel test system across different temperatures, materials, airfoils, and attack angles. An adhesion strength measurement system is developed for various airfoil shapes to quantify the adhesion strength of iced blades. The experimental findings reveal that the ice type shifts from glaze ice to rime ice as temperature decreases. Moreover, the ice morphology transitions from irregular shapes to quasi-aerodynamic forms. The ice adhesion strength increases as the temperature decreases, although the increase rate diminishes with further temperature decreases. The adhesion strength exhibits a maximum increase of 122.2 % within the temperature range of −4°C to −16 °C. Additionally, the characteristics of icing and adhesion are significantly influenced by material properties, airfoil geometry, and attack angle. This research underscores the significance of exploring adhesion characteristics in wind turbine icing studies to enhance understanding of adhesion characteristics, offering valuable references for developing anti-icing and de-icing technologies.

1. Introduction
Icing is a prevalent natural phenomenon that can significantly impact daily life. For example, ice accumulation on highways, aircraft, power lines, and buildings often creates safety hazards and leads to substantial economic losses [1,2]. In the wind energy sector, the aerodynamic profile of blades is essential for the stable operation of wind turbines [3]. However, when ice accumulates on the blade surfaces, it alters their shape and disrupts aerodynamic performance, decreasing the power output [4,5]. Research shows that icing events lasting as little as 30 h can cause power losses of up to 80 %, underscoring the critical need for comprehensive studies on icing issues [6,7].
The icing study on wind turbines is primarily based on theories developed for aircraft icing, particularly in aerodynamics, heat transfer, and related disciplines [8]. In the atmosphere, supercooled droplets carried by airflow collide with blade surfaces, freeze into ice, and accumulate [9]. This process encompasses complex phenomena, including heat transfer, mass transfer, and phase changes [10,11]. However, current research often neglects a systematic evaluation of the adhesion characteristics of iced blades, causing a lack of comprehensive understanding of their icing behavior [12,13]. The adhesion strength of ice on blade surfaces is a critical indicator for assessing the difficulty of ice removal [14]. Adhesion characteristics are key parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of de-icing technologies. As such, they require further investigation.
Research on adhesion characteristics includes theoretical and experimental approaches. The current theoretical framework for adhesion is incomplete, and studies focused specifically on blades are limited [15,16]. Thus, using experimental methods to derive the principles of adhesion characteristics is a straightforward research strategy [17]. Researchers have investigated ice adhesion mechanics on flat or cylindrical surfaces [18,19]. In contrast, studies focusing specifically on blades are relatively scarce [20]. Rønneberg et al. [21] explored how different ice types affect the ice adhesion strength on aluminum plates. Zhu et al. [22] explored the ice adhesion characteristics on aluminum cylinders. However, the geometries of the plates and cylinders in these studies do not accurately reflect the geometry of wind turbine airfoils. Additionally, researchers primarily focus on the adhesion characteristics of droplets and water under static freezing conditions rather than on the adhesion properties resulting from the impact of supercooled droplets [23,24]. Grimmer et al. [25] measured the tensile ice adhesion on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces under static ice conditions. Ibáñez et al. [26] assessed the ice adhesion strength on a rigid-flexible composite under static icing conditions. However, in the context of wind turbines, the predominant icing on blades comes from the impact ice in natural environments, not static ice. Finally, researchers often describe experimental findings in studying ice adhesion characteristics on blades rather than deeply exploring the adhesion mechanisms. Andrea et al. [27] investigated the ice adhesion characteristics on blade surfaces under glazed and rime ice conditions. Mu et al. [28] explored the effects of varying salt content, temperature, and wind speed on ice adhesion on blade surfaces. However, these studies do not systematically analyze the mechanisms and variations of ice adhesion. In thermal terms, the adhesion characteristics of ice may be closely linked to the thermophysical properties of materials. Therefore, although the existing studies provide some insight into the mechanisms of ice adhesion, notable knowledge gaps are still present.
This paper addresses the limitations of the existing research by focusing on the ice adhesion characteristics of wind turbine blade segments. Experimental research is conducted under impact ice conditions using an icing wind tunnel test system. An adhesion force measurement system is introduced to meet various airfoil experimental requirements. This system enables precise measurement of ice adhesion strength on airfoil surfaces, resulting in more comprehensive and reliable data. This study explores the effects of temperatures, material properties, airfoil geometries, and attack angles on the ice adhesion characteristics. Additionally, the correlation between ice adhesion characteristics and the thermal-physical properties of materials is analyzed to address the existing research gaps. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental system, procedures, and scheme. Section 3 defines the quantitative evaluation methods for ice accretion and ice adhesion strength. Section 4 systematically analyzes the effects of temperatures, materials, airfoil geometries, and attack angles on ice accretion distribution and adhesion strength. Lastly, Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and research prospects. The results of this study provide valuable references for the development of effective anti-icing and de-icing technologies.
2. Experimental investigation
2.1. Experimental blade
This study investigates two airfoils (NACA0018 and DU21) and two blade materials (6061 Al and GFRP), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The NACA0018 airfoil exhibits a higher power coefficient, which is widely used in vertical-axis wind turbines [29]. The NACA0018 airfoil is characterized by a symmetrical shape and is suitable for fundamental research. The DU21 airfoil, which is dissymmetrical, applies to the middle section of large horizontal-axis wind turbines. Certain researchers have utilized the DU21 model to calculate the icing distribution on the blade surface [30]. Material 6061Al exhibits isotropic properties and stable heat transfer stability characteristics, making it applicable to the experimental research of icing characteristics and adhesion properties [31]. GFRP is characterized by lightweight, high mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance properties. GFRP is one of the primary materials for large horizontal-axis wind turbine blades [32]. The experimental blade segment features a 150 mm chord length, 20 mm span, and 2 mm wall thickness, as shown in Fig. 1. Surface roughness measurements yield Ra values of 0.72 μm, 0.73 μm, and 0.70 μm for blades (a), (b), and (c), respectively.

2.2. Experimental system and procedure
The experimental system comprises an icing wind tunnel and an adhesion measurement system. Fig. 2(a) presents the configuration of the icing wind tunnel. Key parameters include a cross-sectional area of 250 mm × 250 mm for the test section, temperature range of 0 °C to −20 °C, wind speed range of 0 m/s to 20 m/s, liquid water content (LWC) range of 0.1 g/m3 to 5.0 g/m3, and a medium volume diameter (MVD) range of 20 μm to 100 μm. The test blade and support structure exhibit a blockage ratio of 1.8 %, meeting standard testing requirements [33]. Temperature and wind speed in the test section are calibrated using a thermal anemometer (Testo 405i) at −10 °C and 10 m/s, with calibration positions marked in Fig. 2(b). The test blade is mounted at the geometric center of the section, where both temperature and airflow velocity exhibited uniform distributions, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Calibration procedures and results for LWC and MVD parameters are detailed in the previous study conducted by the authors of this paper [34].

The adhesion measurement system comprises a refrigeration chamber, measurement device, and data acquisition system. The chamber (XINGX BD/BC-217JE, China) maintains a temperature range of −30 °C to 0 °C with a temperature control accuracy of 1 °C. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the adhesion measurement device is installed inside the chamber. The data acquisition system integrates three key components: a pressure sensor (JLBM-1, Jinno Sensor, Bengbu, China, with a 0 N to 500 N measurement range and 0.3 % error tolerance), a digital transmitter, and a computer. The loading speed was controlled at 1.6 mm/s during testing. Fig. 3(b) presents the system's performance under no-load and load conditions. The no-load measurements showed minimal values (1 N to 6 N), demonstrating sufficient sensitivity for detecting ice adhesion forces on airfoil surfaces. Notably, these no-load data were systematically subtracted from experimental results as inherent system errors during data processing.

This study was conducted during winter in Harbin with flexible scheduling of test dates according to actual weather conditions to minimize the influence of laboratory ambient temperature on experimental results. Once the weather forecasts indicated an outdoor temperature of −3 to −5°C between 8:00 and 10:00 AM, laboratory ventilation was activated to equilibrate indoor and outdoor temperatures. This process enabled stable maintenance of −4 ± 1°C for conducting experiments under −4°C conditions. High-precision temperature sensors continuously monitored laboratory temperature, ensuring fluctuations remained within acceptable limits. The transfer time was limited to 3–4 s when specimens were moved from the icing wind tunnel to the refrigeration chamber to preserve specimen thermal stability during transfers. This approach reduced environmental temperature impacts on specimen thermal equilibrium. Key experimental procedures are illustrated in Fig. 4 and listed as follows:

(1) Researchers activated the icing wind tunnel system and configured operational parameters. After achieving preset temperature and wind speed values, the clean blade segment was secured on the support fixture within the test section.
(2) The spray system for ice accretion was initiated once the blade’s surface temperature stabilized at ambient conditions. Dual Phantom v5.1 high-speed cameras (1024 × 1024 pixels, USA) simultaneously captured ice formation dynamics from perpendicular (side and top) views. The spray system was deactivated upon reaching a predetermined icing duration, followed by extended cooling of the iced specimen.
(3) The iced blade was transferred to the adhesion measurement device. Pressure sensors controlled the blade fixture, driving it along linear guides at 1.6 mm/s. Shear forces induced ice-substrate separation during passage through the de-icing hole. The pressure sensors continuously monitored shear forces, transmitting real-time data to the acquisition system.
(4) Researchers recorded post-measurement residual ice distribution patterns. The blade subsequently underwent thorough cleaning for subsequent experimental cycles.
TT-K-36 K-type thermocouples coupled with a multi-channel temperature measurement system were employed to ensure the thermodynamic equilibrium of the test blade before and after icing experiments by monitoring key icing zones at the blade leading edge. The measurement locations are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). Dynamic temperature variations for −4°C and 10 m/s wind speed in the icing tunnel test section are presented in Fig. 5(b). The 6061 aluminum alloy (6061Al) blade surface temperature aligned with the ambient temperature after 70 s of cooling. In contrast, the glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) blade required 150 s due to its lower thermal conductivity. Accordingly, a 5-minute cooling period was implemented for pre-icing and post-icing to guarantee complete thermodynamic equilibrium, ensuring experimental data reliability.

2.3. Experimental scheme
Temperature is a critical factor influencing ice types and their characteristics [35]. The existing studies demonstrated that atmospheric ice can be categorized into glaze, mixed, and rime ice depending on different temperature conditions. Temperature governs ice formation and modifies ice morphology, distribution patterns, and physical properties on blade surfaces, possibly altering ice adhesion characteristics. Five temperatures (−4 °C, −7 °C, −10 °C, −13 °C, and − 16 °C) are selected to evaluate temperature effects on ice adhesion. These temperatures cover typical low-temperature environments encountered by operational wind turbines, providing critical references for practical applications. Furthermore, temperature selection establishes a systematic framework for experimental design. A comprehensive testing matrix was developed based on the specified conditions to investigate ice formation and adhesion across different materials, airfoil geometries, and attack angles. Systematic temperature selection ensures experimental comparability while maintaining research integrity.
The 6061 aluminum alloy (6061Al) material is widely used in aerospace applications and icing studies due to its excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability. Furthermore, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) has become a primary material for large horizontal-axis wind turbine blades due to its lightweight, high strength, and corrosion resistance. This study selects 6061Al and GFRP while focusing on three temperatures (−4°C, −10 °C, and −16 °C) to investigate their ice adhesion performance differences under varying temperature conditions. NACA0018, a symmetrical airfoil, is widely adopted in straight-bladed vertical-axis wind turbines and icing studies. Its symmetrical design facilitates fundamental theoretical investigations. In contrast, the DU21 is an asymmetrical airfoil predominantly employed in mid-sections of large horizontal-axis wind turbine blades, achieving higher lift with lower drag. This study utilizes NACA0018 and DU21 airfoils to systematically compare ice adhesion characteristics between symmetrical and asymmetrical airfoils under three controlled temperatures: −4°C, −10 °C, and −16 °C. Additionally, this study incorporates the optimal lift-to-drag ratio of the NACA0018 airfoil under varying Reynolds numbers by selecting five attack angles: −10°, −5°, 0°, 5°, and 10°. At −10 °C, the effect of attack angle variations on ice adhesion characteristics is systematically investigated. Experimental wind speed was maintained at 10 m/s, with liquid water content (LWC) at 0.67 g/m3 and a medium volume diameter (MVD) of 40 μm. Pre-icing and post-icing cooling periods lasted 5 min each, followed by a 6-minute icing phase. All tests were conducted with 8–10 independent replicates to ensure data stability and reliability. Specific experimental parameters are detailed in Table 1.

3. Evaluation method
3.1. Ice characteristic
This paper introduces several parameters to assess the ice characteristic of the blade surface: ice area (Ss), ice average thickness (Hi), and ice coverage ratio (αi). The parameters are shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Parameters of ice characteristics: (a) ice area; (b) ice average thickness; (c) ice coverage ratio.

Ice area (Ss) represents the area covered by ice on the blade surface in the side view, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Average ice thickness (Hi) corresponds to the mean thickness of ice within a designated area on the blade surface, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Parameter C denotes the blade’s chord length, aligns with the X-axis, and is segmented into n identical sections. Parameter xi represents the relative position along the chord, where i = 1, 2, 3,…, n. For example, within the segment defined by xi-1 and xi, the ice area is designated as Si, the arc length of the blade is Li, and the ice average thickness (Hi) is calculated via Eq. (1):

Fig. 6(c) illustrates the three types of ice zones on the blade surface. The first type is the dense zone, comprising the dense glaze or rime ice, whose ice area is designated as A1. The defining feature of the dense zone is its dense, gap-free ice formation. The second type is the gap zone, formed by the columnar glaze or rime ice, with its ice area designated as A2. The characteristic of the gap zone is that ice is columnar, loose, and has gaps. The third type is the scattered zone, formed by punctate glaze or rime ice, with its ice area designated as A3. The characteristic of the scattered zone is that ice is scattered and punctuated. The coverage ratio of ice αi is the ratio of zone area Ai to the projection area St in the top view. This coverage ratio αi is expressed by Eq. (2):

4. Results and discussion
4.1. The effect of temperature
Fig. 8 illustrates the ice formation characteristics on blade surfaces under varying temperature conditions through side and top views. As shown in Fig. 8(a), glaze ice forms on the blade surface at −4°C, accompanied by icicle formation at the bottom. The heat transfer mechanism during icing is analyzed to elucidate this phenomenon. When supercooled droplets impinge on the blade surface, they release latent heat through the phase transition and freeze. The heat transfer fails to dissipate all released latent heat at this relatively high temperature (−4°C). Consequently, while some droplets freeze instantly, others remain liquid by absorbing latent heat, forming a water film on the airfoil surface. This water film propagates from the leading edge to the trailing edge under combined aerodynamic and gravitational forces.

During transport, the film gradually freezes, forming the characteristic “runback effect” − a physical process that aligns with the observations reported by Y. Liu et al. [10,11]. The water film preferentially accumulates and solidifies at the blade base under gravitational forces, forming distinct icicles. This effect increases the blade's weight and significantly alters the airfoil's profile, possibly affecting the blade’s aerodynamic performance. As the ambient temperature decreases, enhanced heat transfer between supercooled droplets and surroundings induces three key transformations:
(1) the icicles disappear from the blade bottom,
(2) the ice contour transforms from an irregular to a quasi-aerodynamic shape, and.
(3) the ice type transitions from glazed to rime ice, as visually documented in Fig. 8(a).
Fig. 8(b) reveals prominent ice protrusions along both sides of the blade’s leading edge. Columnar and punctate ice are notably observed within the red boxes marking regions, exhibiting distinct morphologies as captured in Snapshot 1 of Fig. 8(c). As temperatures further decreased, the protruding ice gradually diminished. In contrast, areas covered by columnar and punctate ice expanded significantly. This trend is clearly illustrated in Fig. 8(b) and 8(c).
The ice area Ss, ice average thickness Hi, the coverage ratio of ice αi, and ice adhesion strength τ under different temperature conditions are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the ice area first decreases and then increases with decreasing temperature. The influence of temperature on the ice area gradually diminishes when temperatures drop below −13 °C The concept of droplet collection efficiency (which is defined as the ratio of supercooled water droplets captured by the blade surface to the total amount potentially passing through the corresponding airflow region under specific environmental conditions [36]) is first clarified to understand the abovementioned phenomenon.

Multiple factors influence the droplet collection efficiency, including wind speed, liquid water content (LWC), medium volume diameter (MVD), temperature, airfoil geometry, blade material, and attack angle. Significant variations in the droplet collection efficiency can also be observed across different regions of the blade surface. Within the flow field, supercooled droplets exchange heat with the blade and surrounding environment upon impact. Lower temperatures accelerate the heat transfer rate. However, at −4°C, the heat exchange between droplets and the blade is prolonged compared to lower temperature conditions. This observation indicates that some supercooled droplets do not freeze immediately upon impact in regions with high droplet collection efficiency near the blade leading edge. Instead, the droplets accumulate, forming a water film on the blade surface. Under aerodynamic forces and gravity, the water film flows from the leading edge toward the trailing edge while progressively freezing. Icicles form as the water film freezes near the blade bottom, resulting in a comparatively greater ice area at −4°C. The heat exchange time shortened as the temperature decreased, accelerating the freezing rate. This effect caused the disappearance of icicles and a subsequent reduction in the ice area. The ice area reached its minimum at −7°C. As temperatures decreased below −7°C, the accelerated freezing rate enhanced droplet collection efficiency on blade surfaces, causing progressive ice area expansion. However, since droplet collection efficiency depends on temperature and LWC, this expansion exhibited non-linear characteristics. The number of freezable droplets per unit of time approached saturation once the freezing rate exceeded a critical threshold under constant LWC conditions. Consequently, the ice area growth became constrained as droplet collection efficiency neared its limit. Further temperature decreases showed negligible effects on ice area expansion below −13 °C. Notably, the evolution of the ice type also influenced the ice area. The predominant ice type transitioned from dense glaze ice to porous rime ice with decreasing temperatures. Rime ice demonstrated greater volume and structural porosity than dense glaze ice. This evolution further promoted the increasing trend of the ice area at lower temperatures.
Fig. 9(b) demonstrates that ice progressively expands in distribution and thickness with decreasing temperature. At −4 ℃, ice accumulates between −12 % to 9 % chord positions on the blade surface, exhibiting broader distribution on the bottom surface. The icicles develop between −12 % to −7% chord positions on the bottom surface, reaching a maximum thickness of 31.3 mm. As the temperature further decreases, the icicle disappears, the ice thickness increases, and the ice layer extends to −15 % to 12 % chord positions. The maximum ice thickness of 17.4 mm occurs between −1% to 1 % chord positions, exceeding values in other regions. Ice thickness displays a gradual attenuation pattern from the leading edge to the trailing edge.
As shown in Fig. 9(c), the ice area expands on the blade top with decreasing temperature. However, notable disparities are observed among distinct zones: a decrease in the coverage ratio of the dense zone is accompanied by an increase in the coverage ratios of the gap and scattered zones. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are as follows. As previously stated, supercooled droplets freeze slowly on the blade surface at −4 ℃. Unfrozen droplets gradually accumulate in regions characterized by a high droplet collection coefficient, coalescing to form a water film. Driven by airflow, this water film migrates from leading to trailing edges, releasing latent heat to form continuous dense ice. Consequently, dense zone coverage predominates in this condition. Temperature variations alter droplet freezing behavior after surface impact. Droplets accumulate, form water film, flow, and freeze progressively (model 1) at higher temperatures (−4 ℃). At lower temperatures, droplets freeze instantaneously upon contact (model 2). As the temperature decreases, the freezing rate of the droplets accelerates, leading to a gradual transition from model 1 to model 2. This transition localizes dense ice formation to the leading edge, where the droplet collection coefficient is prominent. Moreover, regions with lower collection coefficients develop columnar and punctate ice due to reduced droplet supply. These phenomena explain the inverse relationship between dense zone reduction and gap/scattered zone expansion.
As shown in Fig. 9(d), the ice adhesion strength increases with decreasing temperature while its growth rate gradually decreases. When the temperature decreases from −4 °C to −16 °C, the ice adhesion strength on the blade surface increases from 195.4 kPa to 434.1 kPa, representing a 122.2 % enhancement. On the micro-scale, the surface features of the blade resemble those of natural terrain. Diverse-shaped peaks and valleys are randomly distributed on the blade surface. During droplet impact, water permeates these microstructures before freezing through thermal exchange. Phase transition releases latent heat that temporarily raises the surface temperature, which subsequently returns to ambient levels through convective heat transfer. Differential thermal contraction emerges during cooling due to distinct linear thermal expansion coefficients: ice (52.03 × 10-6/K) vs. aluminum (22.6 × 10-6/K). The volume shrinkage of ice is greater than that of the microstructures (peaks and valleys). The ice squeezes against the peaks, forming a mechanically interlocked structure. As the temperature decreases, the volume shrinkage of ice and peaks increases. This change increases the compression stress between ice and peaks. Consequently, the ice adhesion strength increases on the blade surface. However, the brittle nature of ice imposes non-linear constraints. When compressive stress exceeds the ice's strength threshold, interfacial cracking occurs. This failure mechanism progressively attenuates adhesion enhancement rates with continued temperature decreases.
Fig. 9(e) demonstrates a comparison of the experimental results with previous studies [22,37]. The obtained ice adhesion strength values range from 195.4 kPa to 434.1 kPa, while Zhu et al. reported values of 95.5 kPa to 265.5 kPa [22], and Chu et al. documented a range of 91.5 kPa to 426 kPa [37]. These discrepancies originate from variations in testing conditions, as systematically compared in Table 2.

Fig. 9(f) illustrates the relationship between the number of experimental repetitions and the mean values with standard deviations. As shown in Fig. 9(f), mean values and standard deviations remained relatively stable with no significant fluctuations as experimental repetitions increased. The −10 °C condition is taken as an example. The mean value measured 362.1 kPa with a standard deviation of 61.2 kPa for five repetitions. When increasing to six repetitions, these values became 360.8 kPa (mean) and 55.9 kPa (standard deviation). The mean decreased to 358.1 kPa for seven repetitions, while the standard deviation declined to 52.2 kPa. With eight repetitions, the mean stabilized at 358.7 kPa and a further reduced standard deviation of 48.8 kPa. The mean values fluctuated within a narrow range, while the standard deviations demonstrated a gradual downward trend with increasing repetitions. This trend indicates good experimental reproducibility.
4.2. The effect of material
Fig. 10 demonstrates ice accumulation on blade surfaces across different materials in both side and top views. As illustrated in Fig. 10(a), at −4 ℃, glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) and 6061 aluminum alloy (6061Al) blades develop glaze ice with icicles forming at the blade bottom. As the temperature decreases, the ice transforms from glaze ice to rime ice. Simultaneously, the icicle disappears at the bottom of the blade, and the ice contour transitions from irregular to quasi-aerodynamic shape. However, icicles are still observed on the bottom of the GFRP blade at −10 ℃. Fig. 10(b) reveals more prominent ice bulges along GFRP leading edges than 6061Al counterparts under equivalent conditions. At −4 ℃, the GFRP blade forms continuous dense ice, while 6061Al blades exhibit three distinct zones—dense, gap, and scattered—as evident in snapshots 1 and 2 in Fig. 10(c). As documented in Fig. 10(b) and 10(c), additional temperature decreases enhance gap and scattered zone prevalence on both materials.

Fig. 11 illustrates four key parameters under different material conditions: ice area, Ss, ice average thickness, Hi, the coverage ratio of ice, αi, and ice adhesion strength, τ. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the blade’s material significantly influences the ice area at −4℃. However, this effect weakens as the temperature decreases. This phenomenon can be attributed to material thermal conductivity differences: 6061Al exhibits 167 W/(m·K) versus 0.42 W/(m·K) for GFRP. Under identical experimental conditions, the energy exchange rate between supercooled droplets and GFRP surfaces occurs more slowly than with 6061Al. Consequently, GFRP blades develop larger icicles at the blade bottom and greater ice area than 6061Al blades at −4℃. As the temperature decreases, accelerated energy transfer between supercooled droplets and the environment enhances droplet freezing rates. Enhanced freezing rates progressively diminish material-dependent thermal conductivity effects. This transition explains the observed attenuation of material influence on ice area formation as temperatures decrease below −4℃.

The observed phenomenon correlates with material thermal conductivity. At −4 ℃, the GFRP blade exhibits wider ice distribution (−16 % to 11 % chord positions) than its 6061Al counterpart, accompanied by significant thickness discrepancies. Decreasing temperatures accelerate droplet freezing upon blade contact. When cooled to −10 ℃, both blades demonstrate comparable ice distribution (−14 % to 11 % chord positions) and thickness. Ultimately, at −16 ℃, the material’s thermal conductivity exerts negligible influence on ice formation parameters, producing identical ice distribution patterns and thickness between two blades.
As shown in Fig. 11(c), the impact of blade material on the ice zone is significantly affected by temperature. This phenomenon can be attributed to variations in material thermal conductivity. At relatively high temperatures, supercooled droplets exhibit delayed solidification after droplet impingement on the blade with low thermal conductivity. This delayed freezing facilitates the formation of glazed ice. Consequently, at −4 ℃, the GFRP blade exhibits a dense zone, whereas the 6061Al blade displays a mix of dense, gap, and scattered zones. With decreasing temperature, enhanced heat transfer accelerates droplet solidification. The influence of thermal conductivity on the type of ice zone diminishes as the temperature further decreases. Consequently, at −16℃, GFRP and 6061Al blades achieve comparable ice coverage ratios across different zones.
Fig. 11(d) illustrates a progressive increase in ice adhesion strength for GFRP and 6061Al blades with decreasing temperatures. Notably, 6061Al blades demonstrate significantly higher adhesion strength than GFRP counterparts under identical conditions. Quantitative analysis shows that ice adhesion strength values of 6061Al blades are 2.2–2.7 times higher than GFRP blades at equivalent temperatures. This disparity is related to material thermal expansion coefficients. As previously described, supercooled droplets impacting blade surfaces exchange energy with the substrate during freezing, releasing latent heat that temporarily raises blade temperatures. Subsequent cooling under low-temperature conditions gradually decreases ice and blade temperatures toward ambient levels. Ice and microstructures undergo microscale volume shrinkage during cooling. Ice is characterized by a thermal expansion coefficient of 52.03 × 10-6/K, compared to 22.6 × 10-6/K for 6061Al. GFRP displays anisotropic thermal expansion behavior, with coefficients measuring 15.91 × 10-6/K horizontally and 59.78 × 10-6/K vertically. On 6061Al surfaces, ice experiences greater volumetric shrinkage than the blade's microstructures (peaks and valleys). This differential shrinkage creates compressive forces where ice mechanically interlocks with microstructures. On the other hand, GFRP surfaces exhibit horizontal ice compression against peaks while maintaining vertical decoupling due to mismatched shrinkage patterns of GFRP. These distinct interfacial interactions explain stronger ice adhesion observed on 6061Al blades compared to GFRP blades under identical testing conditions.
4.3. The effect of airfoil
Fig. 12 presents ice characteristics on blade surfaces under different airfoil profiles from side and top views. As shown in Fig. 12(a), DU21 and NACA0018 airfoils exhibit glaze ice formation at −4 ℃, with distinct icicles developing along the blade bottom. The transformation occurs from glazed to rime ice with a decrease in temperature, accompanied by icicle disappearance and ice contour evolution from irregular to quasi-aerodynamic configurations. Fig. 12(b) reveals greater ice accumulation on DU21 airfoil upper surfaces than NACA0018 across temperature conditions. At −4 ℃, both airfoils display ice bulges along leading edge lateral surfaces, with perimeter regions showing characteristic columnar and punctate ice structures (Fig. 12(c), snapshots 1–2). The bulge gradually disappears with a further decrease in temperature. As depicted in Fig. 12(b) and 12(c), the area occupied by columnar and punctate ice increases.

Fig. 13 presents some parameters under different airfoil conditions, including ice area, Ss, ice average thickness, Hi, the coverage ratio of ice, αi, and ice adhesion strength, τ. As shown in Fig. 13(a), the DU21 airfoil shows consistently larger ice areas than NACA0018 across temperature conditions. This difference correlates with DU21′s greater frontal area: a 0° attack angle with 150 mm chord length and 20 mm span shows a 630 mm2 frontal area for DU21 versus 540 mm2 for NACA0018. The larger frontal area increases the probability of supercooled droplet collisions in flow fields under identical test conditions, enhancing ice accretion on the DU21 surface.

Fig. 13. The effect of airfoil on icing characteristics and adhesion properties: (a) ice area; (b) ice average thickness; (c) ice coverage ratio; (d) ice adhesion strength; (e) the effect of curvature on ice adhesion strength [39]; (f) the curvature of NACA0018 and DU21.

Fig. 13(b) reveals that the DU21 airfoil exhibits a wider distribution of ice accumulation compared to the NACA0018 under various temperature conditions. This discrepancy is related to the airfoils' relative thickness differences. DU21 has 21 % relative thickness (31.5 mm maximum thickness) versus 18 % for NACA0018 (27 mm maximum thickness). The greater thickness of DU21 likely contributes to its extended ice distribution. At −10℃ and −16℃, DU21 develops thicker ice layers across most blade surface regions compared to NACA0018. This result may relate to the geometric features of the airfoil profile, including its relative thickness and camber, as well as the position of maximum thickness and maximum camber. Previous studies under 0.48 g/m3 LWC and 50 μm MVD conditions demonstrated that ice mass on S809 airfoils increases with thickness [38]. Nevertheless, airfoils with similar thicknesses (S808-S819) exhibit substantial ice mass variations under identical conditions. Therefore, relative airfoil thickness may be an important factor affecting ice thickness on the airfoil; however, it is not the only one. Parameters such as relative camber and the positions of maximum thickness and maximum camber may also determine the ice thickness on the surface.
Fig. 13(c) demonstrates that DU21 and NACA0018 exhibit similar ice coverage ratio variation trends with decreasing temperature, though DU21 maintains consistently higher values. This difference originates from the distinct frontal areas on their upper surfaces. The frontal area of the upper surface of DU21 is approximately 371 mm2, while that of NACA0018 is 270 mm2. A significantly larger frontal area directly promotes ice accumulation under identical experimental conditions, accounting for the higher ice coverage ratio observed on the DU21 compared to the NACA0018.
Fig. 13(d) illustrates temperature-dependent variations in ice adhesion strength on both airfoil surfaces. As temperature decreases, DU21 and NACA0018 airfoils exhibit progressively stronger ice adhesion. However, NACA0018 consistently demonstrates superior adhesion strength compared to DU21. Under identical conditions, the NACA0018 airfoil exhibited 1.2–1.5 times higher ice adhesion strength than its DU21 counterpart. This result correlates with airfoil curvature characteristics. The existing research indicates that the ice adhesion strength increases with curvature under non-impact icing conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 13(e) [39]. The curvature threshold K = 0.04 m−1 defines two distinct regimes. The curvature minimally affects adhesion strength below this critical value. On the other hand, adhesion strength shows marked enhancement with increasing curvature beyond 0.04 m−1. Therefore, surface regions of the airfoil are classified based on curvature values, with curvature below 0.04 m−1 defining low-adhesion areas and curvature exceeding 0.04 m−1 characterizing high-adhesion areas.
Fig. 13(f) presents curvature distributions of DU21 and NACA0018 airfoils within icing regions. The DU21 airfoil demonstrates a high-adhesion area spanning from −3.3 % to 2.8 % in relative position, corresponding to a 15.34 mm arc length. In comparison, NACA0018 shows a wider high-adhesion range from −4% to 4 % with a 19.79 mm arc length. The measured arc length difference between DU21 and NACA0018 confirms a reduced high-adhesion area in the DU21 airfoil. Additionally, temperature variations significantly influence icing characteristics, with measured arc lengths showing progressive expansion at lower temperatures. The DU21 airfoil exhibited icing arc lengths of 58.51 mm (−4℃), 60.09 mm (−10℃), and 63.16 mm (−16℃). In contrast, the NACA0018 demonstrated values of 40.51 mm (−4℃), 46.66 mm (−10℃), and 49.72 mm (−16℃). These measurements consistently indicate larger icing areas in DU21 compared to NACA0018 under identical temperature conditions. The arc length ratio between high-adhesive and icing regions partially reflects the relative ice adhesion strength differences across airfoils. The DU21 airfoil shows ratios of 0.262, 0.255, and 0.243. On the other hand, the NACA0018 airfoil demonstrates higher values of 0.489, 0.424, and 0.398. These measurements confirm stronger ice adhesion in the NACA0018 airfoil.
However, Fig. 13(d) reveals that the difference in ice adhesion strength between these airfoils appears less significant than their arc length ratio contrast. The reasons underlying these differences are as follows. Zarasvand et al. [39] employed non-impact ice formed under static freezing conditions. However, this paper examines the impact of ice generated in icing wind tunnels. Previous research has demonstrated significant differences in ice adhesion between non-impact and impact ice [21]. Consequently, the influence of curvature on ice adhesion strength varies depending on the type of ice. Additionally, the previous work explored curvature effects within 0 m−1 to 0.08 m−1 [39]. In contrast, this paper evaluates DU21 and NACA0012 airfoils with curvature ranges of 0.0086 m−1 to 0.266 m−1 and 0.0074 m−1 to 0.1923 m−1 respectively, measured across the −20 % to 20 % chord region of the airfoil surfaces. This curvature range significantly exceeds the range studied by Zarasvand et al. Future research will investigate the relationship between ice adhesion strength and curvature when the curvature exceeds 0.08 m−1.
4.4. The effect of the attack angle
Fig. 14 presents ice accumulation on blade surfaces across varying attack angles in side and top views. The blade’s surface consistently exhibits mixed ice regardless of attack angle, as evidenced in Fig. 14(a). At an attack angle of −10°, the ice primarily accumulates on the leading edge and top of the blade. As the attack angle increases, the ice zone shifts from the top to the bottom of the blade surface. Fig. 14(b) reveals distinct ice distribution characteristics at a −10° attack angle, showing a gradual transition from a dense zone near the leading edge to the gap and scattered zones toward the trailing edge. As the attack angle increases, the ice area diminishes, reducing the density, gap, and scattered ice zones on the top of the blade, as evident in Fig. 14(b) and 14(c).

The ice area Ss, ice average thickness Hi, the coverage ratio of ice αi, and ice adhesion strength τ under different attack angle conditions are shown in Fig. 15. According to Fig. 15(a), as the attack angle rises, the ice area on the blade surface initially decreases and then increases. The influence of positive versus negative attack angles on the ice area is negligible at a fixed angle. This outcome may stem from the blade's frontal area. Specifically, at an attack angle of −10°, the blade's frontal area is relatively large, enhancing the likelihood of supercooled droplets striking the blade. Hence, the ice area increases. As the attack angle increases, the blade's frontal area initially diminishes but enlarges. Consequently, the variation in the pattern of the ice area mirrors that of the frontal area. The blade's frontal area remains constant during tests for positive and negative attack angles, such as −10° and 10°. Thus, the probability of supercooled droplets impacting the blade remains consistent, accounting for the insignificant impact of positive or negative attack angles on the ice area.

Fig. 15(b) demonstrates significant variations in ice thickness and distribution along blade surfaces under different attack angles. At a −10° attack angle, ice accumulates between −6% and 26 % chord positions of the leading edge, attaining a maximum thickness of 15.6 mm. Increasing the attack angles induces downward expansion and upward contraction of ice coverage. Consequently, the distribution range is shifted from −6% to 26 % toward −30 % to 6 % chord positions of the leading edge. Concurrently, ice thickness diminishes on the blade top while intensifying on the bottom sections, reducing peak thickness from 15.6 mm to 12.4 mm. Positive attack angles exhibit broader ice distribution but thinner maximum ice thickness compared to negative counterparts for the same angles. This pattern correlates with gravity-influenced droplet dynamics during supercooled impingement. Positive angles increase lower blade surface exposure, directing droplet runoff toward the trailing edge. In contrast, negative angles enhance upper surface exposure, channeling droplet flow toward the leading edge. Therefore, the positive attack angle exhibits a larger ice distribution but a thinner maximum ice thickness at equal angles than the negative attack angle.
Fig. 15(c) demonstrates a decreasing blade-top-ice coverage ratio trend with increasing attack angles. This phenomenon can be attributed to reduced frontal area at the blade top. At −10° attack angle, the maximum frontal area corresponds to a 4.7 % dense zone ratio. The corresponding gap and scattered zones occupy 15.6 % and 9.2 %, respectively. Progressive angle elevation diminishes the frontal area, resulting in corresponding reductions in all three ice zones. When the attack angle reaches 10°, the dense zone proportion decreases to 1.3 %. Lastly, gap and scattered zones contract to 8.4 % and 0.9 %, respectively.
Fig. 15(d) displays a non-linear relationship between ice adhesion strength and increasing attack angle on the blade surface, showing an initial rise followed by a decline. The variation in attack angle changes the ice adhesion strength up to 23.4 %. This phenomenon is related to airfoil curvature characteristics. The previous analysis identified the high-adhesive zone of the NACA0018 airfoil extending from −4% to 4 % chord positions, i.e., spanning 19.79 mm arc length. Measured ice-covered arc lengths demonstrate angle-dependent variations: 56.91 mm (−10°), 48.15 mm (−5°), 46.66 mm (0°), 47.99 mm (5°), and 62.91 mm (10°). The proportional relationship between high-adhesive arc length and ice-covered area (0.348 at −10°, 0.411 at −5°, 0.424 at 0°, 0.412 at 5°, and 0.315 at 10°) provides partial explanation for attack angle-dependent ice adhesion strength variations.
5. Conclusions
This study conducted a systematic experimental investigation on the ice adhesion characteristics of wind turbine blades. The effects of temperature, material, airfoil geometry, and attack angle on ice accretion patterns and adhesion properties were systematically quantified using an icing wind tunnel test platform and a self-developed ice adhesion measurement device. The experimental results enhanced the understanding of dynamic ice formation characteristics on airfoil surfaces and revealed the influence of key parameters on ice adhesion strength. These findings provide valuable references for optimizing anti-/de-icing technologies. Several key conclusions are summarized:
(1) The temperature significantly affects the icing properties of the blade surface. As the temperature decreases, the ice transforms from glazed ice to rime ice. Correspondingly, the shape of ice transforms from an irregular to a quasi-aerodynamic contour. Significant changes in the ice area, ice range, and thickness can be observed. The icing zone expands on the blade top, exhibiting significant differences among various zones. Specifically, the coverage ratio of the dense zone decreases, whereas the ratios of the gap and scattered zones proportionally increase. The ice adhesion strength increases; however, the increasing rate decreases gradually. Mechanical tests demonstrated that the ice adhesion strength progressively increased as temperatures decreased, while its growth rate gradually slowed. The maximum adhesion strength increase reached 122.2 % within the −4°C to −16 °C range, with the highest value recorded at −16 °C.
(2) The impact of material on icing properties varies significantly with temperature. At a temperature of −4 ℃, the ice area, ice range, and ice coverage ratio of the GFRP blade are larger than those of the 6061 Al blade. Moreover, the difference in ice thickness between the two materials is notable. As the temperature decreases, the effect of the material's thermal conductivity on icing characteristics diminishes, resulting in similar icing characteristics between GFRP and the 6061 Al blade. Mechanical tests demonstrated that the ice adhesion strength of 6061 Al and GFRP progressively increased with decreasing temperature. However, under identical conditions, the ice adhesion strength of 6061Al blades measured 2.2–2.7 times higher than that of GFRP blades.
(3) The geometric feature of the airfoil significantly affects its icing properties. The DU21 airfoil exhibits a larger ice area, an extensive ice range, and a higher ice coverage ratio than the NACA0018 airfoil at various temperatures. Moreover, the ice thickness significantly differs between the two airfoils. Mechanical testing revealed that NACA0018 and DU21 airfoils gradually increased ice adhesion strength with decreasing temperature. However, under identical icing conditions, the NACA0018 airfoil demonstrated higher ice adhesion strength than its DU21 counterpart, showing 1.2–1.5 times greater values.
(4) The attack angle significantly affects the icing properties of the blade surface. As the attack angle increases, the ice area decreases and subsequently increases while the ice range shifts from the blade top to the bottom. The positive or negative attack angle has a negligible impact on the ice area but significantly alters the icing range. The ice thickness steadily decreases on the blade top and gradually increases on the bottom. The ice coverage ratio decreases on the blade top. Mechanical tests revealed that, as the attack angle increased, the ice adhesion strength exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease. Variations in the attack angle altered the ice adhesion strength by up to 23.4 % within the range of −10° to 10°.
Future research should prioritize experiments under dynamic conditions to better approximate natural environments and enhance engineering applicability. Time-varying parameters such as temperature, wind speed, liquid water content, and medium volume diameter should be incorporated in experimental designs to replicate icing scenarios under complex meteorological conditions. This dynamic simulation approach will enable researchers to systematically investigate the evolution mechanisms of natural icing processes and comprehensively evaluate environmental impacts on wind turbine icing characteristics. The obtained data will support the development of next-generation intelligent anti-/de-icing systems, facilitating transformative progress from laboratory research to practical engineering implementation.
