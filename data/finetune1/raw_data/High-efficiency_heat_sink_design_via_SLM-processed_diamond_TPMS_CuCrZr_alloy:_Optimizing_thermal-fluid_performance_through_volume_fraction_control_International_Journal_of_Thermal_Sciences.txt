1. Introduction
In the context of continuous breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, electronic information, and aerospace technologies, electronic devices are increasingly required to be miniaturized and precisely integrated to support functionalities such as lightweight design, portability, and wearability. The heat dissipation capability of electronic components is particularly critical to the performance of these devices, as inadequate heat dissipation can lead to significant performance degradation [1,2]. Traditional heat sink structures, such as fin-based designs, exhibit inherent limitations that hinder their ability to meet the ever-evolving thermal management demands of modern electronic devices [3,4]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel heat sink structures with superior thermal performance.
Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures are a class of porous structures generated based on implicit function expressions [5], initially inspired by the structures found in flora and fauna in nature [6]. Common TPMS structures include Diamond, Gyroid, I-WP, and Primitive, which can be categorized into strut-based and sheet-based types. TPMS structures, characterized by their unique zero-curvature surfaces [7], exhibit smoother curved features compared to traditional porous scaffold structures (such as BCC and FCC [8,9]). They lack sharp protrusions and straight edges, significantly reducing stress concentrations and uneven heat transfer. As a result, TPMS structures demonstrate superior thermal management performance, making them ideal candidates for the capillary sections of novel heat sinks [4,10]. Danish [11] et al. validated the integration of heat sinks with TPMS structures and concluded that TPMS structures exhibit excellent thermal performance, which may be attributed to the intricate spiral channel configurations and larger heat transfer areas within Gyroid-type TPMS structures. Benjamin [12] et al. conducted experiments using 3D-printed Gyroid structures and found that the Nusselt number of the Gyroid structure increased by 13 % compared to straight-tube heat exchangers. Qian [13] et al. fabricated three TPMS structures (Primitive, Gyroid, and Fischer-Koch S) using pure copper and conducted experiments. Compared to traditional plate-fin heat sinks, the Fischer-Koch S structure achieved a 358.4 % improvement in heat transfer coefficient, while the Gyroid structure showed a 47.8 % enhancement.
The Diamond structure, as one of the most representative TPMS structures, features intricate micro-scale internal configurations [14]. The strut-based Diamond structure (Diamond-Solid) consists of minimally diametered cylindrical entities, while the sheet-based Diamond structure (Diamond-Sheet) comprises thin-walled entities with minimal thickness [15]. The Diamond structure not only exhibits mathematically defined minimal surfaces and high specific surface area, but recent studies have also demonstrated its significant thermo-hydraulic performance advantages under practical flow conditions. For instance, simulations on a topology-optimized printable Diamond TPMS lattice embedded in a gas turbine cooling channel show that the Diamond structure can eliminate large recirculation zones and low heat transfer regions, resulting in a substantial enhancement in total heat transfer and improved temperature uniformity compared to baseline configurations, with heat transfer increases of up to 45.8 % and markedly reduced pressure loss under certain operating conditions [16]. Furthermore, investigations into modified Schwartz-Diamond solid TPMS networks reveal that structural modifications along flow and spanwise directions can significantly influence both flow and heat transfer behaviors, emphasizing the role of geometric tuning in improving thermal-hydraulic performance [17]. These findings highlight that beyond its idealized geometry, the interconnected curvature and tortuous channels of the Diamond TPMS promote intensified flow mixing and disrupt boundary layers, thereby enhancing convective heat transfer while requiring careful balance against flow resistance penalties.
Additionally, since the Diamond structure is generated from a triply periodic minimal surface function, maintaining the integrity of its complex internal curved features during fabrication is crucial. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology can significantly enhance the precision of its internal formation [18], and by adjusting the scanning spacing, high densification of the formed structure can be ensured [19]. Tang [20] et al. compared three TPMS porous structures (Diamond, Gyroid, and I-WP) with fin structures and found that, compared to the fin model, the average convective heat transfer coefficients (have) of Diamond, Gyroid, and I-WP were 85 %–207 %, 55 %–137 %, and 16 %–55 % higher, respectively. The Diamond structure exhibited the best convective heat transfer performance, followed by Gyroid and I-WP. Liang [21] et al. conducted numerical simulations and experimental validations to compare the flow and heat transfer performance of Diamond structures with different unit sizes. They proposed that using the smallest unit size Diamond structure (8 mm) could improve heat transfer efficiency by an additional 10 %, albeit with a 40 % increase in pressure drop. Yeranee and Rao [22] discovered that, compared to traditional pin-fin arrays, the sheet-based Diamond structure demonstrated the highest thermal performance among different TPMS topologies, achieving approximately 77.3 %, with more uniform heat transfer distribution. Yan [23] et al. investigated the heat transfer performance of various TPMS structures using air as the medium. Through comparison, they concluded that the Diamond structure had the highest heat transfer coefficient, reaching 1398 W/m2·K, with average values exceeding those of the Gyroid structure by 30.83 % and the Primitive structure by 28.39 %.
With the continuous advancement of topology optimization and TPMS structural design, their engineering applications rely not only on superior thermo-fluid performance but also critically on the manufacturability of complex topological architectures. In particular, TPMS structures featuring intricate curved-surface geometries can be effectively translated from theoretical designs into practical devices only with the support of additive manufacturing technologies. On the basis of the established compatibility between TPMS topological architectures and the SLM process, material selection emerges as another critical factor in achieving high-performance heat sinks. Among the various materials suitable for Selective Laser Melting (SLM), zirconium-copper alloy (CuCrZr) stands out for its exceptional thermal conductivity, electrical performance, and mechanical properties, making it an ideal candidate for heat exchangers in diverse applications, such as nuclear fusion reactors [24]. In the realm of copper alloys as heat sink materials, Nazzal [25] conducted theoretical research on the performance of pin-fin heat sinks for electronic cooling using different alloy materials. The study revealed that heat sinks made from aluminum-copper alloy exhibited a 2.3 % higher mass compared to those made from pure aluminum. Hu [26] et al. designed a heat sink for the HT-7 superconducting tokamak's actively cooled flat toroidal limiter using CuCr alloy. By brazing a 4 mm-thick CuCr water cladding layer and SS tubes in a tubular oven, heated to 1050 °C in a vacuum, they achieved a fivefold improvement in heat dissipation capacity compared to the previous stainless steel heat sink used in the HT-7 limiter. This enhanced heat sink could handle a steady-state heat load of 5 MW/m2. J. Boscary [27] utilized a CuCr1Zr copper alloy heat sink with CFC NB31 tiles to achieve the thermal management of the 19.6 m2 high-heat-load target area of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) actively water-cooled divertor. This system was designed to remove a fixed heat flux of up to 10 MW/m2 and successfully passed tests at the IPP-Garching workshop.
Based on the aforementioned research and investigation, it is evident that the Diamond structure possesses unique advantages in thermal conductivity compared to other TPMS porous structures. However, in the studies conducted on the heat transfer performance of TPMS structures, significant attention has been given to alloy materials such as Al and Ti [[20], [21], [22]], while research on CuCrZr alloy as a heat exchange material remains limited. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of the heat transfer performance differences between various solid TPMS structures (rod-like and sheet-like) has yet to be established. Additionally, most studies primarily focus on gases as the working fluid [[20], [21], [22]], with limited research on water at room temperature as the working fluid. Therefore, this paper conducts a thermal performance analysis of the Diamond structure fabricated from CuCrZr alloy using Selective Laser Melting (SLM). By adjusting parameters, Diamond structure models with different shapes (rod-like and sheet-like) and porosities are generated. Numerical simulations are performed using the conjugate heat transfer-turbulence (k-ε) physics field in COMSOL Multiphysics, and a fluid heat transfer experimental setup is constructed to validate the simulation results. This study explores the influence of different parameters on the heat transfer performance of the Diamond structure and reveals the heat transfer mechanisms of Diamond-Solid and Diamond-Sheet structures under varying volume fractions. Furthermore, a fin structure is introduced for comparative analysis to investigate the optimal heat transfer performance achievable by the Diamond structure. The study reveals that increasing the relative density enhances the convective heat transfer performance of Diamond structures, accompanied by improved internal flow characteristics. However, this augmentation concurrently leads to a sharp rise in the pressure differential across the structure. Under a constant inflow velocity of 0.4 m/s, the 50 %-porosity Diamond-Sheet configuration demonstrates superior heat transfer capability among all test groups, achieving an average convection coefficient of 10,019.34 W/(m2·K). This represents a remarkable improvement of 186.01 % and 187.83 % compared to conventional Fin and 50 %-porosity Diamond-Solid structures, respectively. The performance evaluation criterion (PEC) reaches 1.09, surpassing the reference Fin structure (PEC = 1).
2. Numerical model
2.1. Mathematical model
The Diamond structure, as one of the most representative TPMS structures, is constructed and generated using implicit function expressions, similar to other TPMS structures. The corresponding initial structures are generated by different functions in MATLAB, and complete solid structures are obtained through Boolean operations in 3D modeling software. By adjusting the value of C in the function, the relative volume fraction of the generated structure can be modified. This study focuses on Diamond structures with volume fractions ranging from 20 % to 50 %. A linear fitting was performed to establish the relationship between the value of C and the corresponding volume fraction, resulting in an expression, as shown in Fig. 1.

(a) The structural function expressions and schematic diagrams of Diamond-Solid and Diamond-Sheet structures, (b) The linear fitting of C values versus relative density for the Diamond-Sheet structure, (c) The linear fitting of C values versus relative density for the Diamond-Solid structure.

Using the linear fitting equation, the values of C for the Diamond-Solid and Diamond-Sheet structures at relative densities of 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % can be approximately determined. The size of a single unit cell is defined by adjusting the period of the implicit function. To reduce computational time while maintaining model accuracy and computational precision, the dimensions of a single unit cell are set to 12 × 12 × 12 mm in this study.
2.2. Physical model
When a fully developed fluid flows through the Diamond structure, a single unit cell of the Diamond structure is insufficient to significantly demonstrate the results of convective heat transfer between the fluid and the structural walls. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the length of the Diamond structure in the fluid flow direction to ensure adequate duration and space for the convective heat transfer process. By adjusting the domain of the function in the x-direction, the TPMS model is extended along this axis. After adjustment, the Diamond structure is elongated from the original 12 × 12 × 12 mm to 12 × 12 × 48 mm. To ensure that the fluid is fully developed both before entering and after exiting the Diamond structure, fluid channels extending 48 mm are added at both ends of the structure. Additionally, to maintain uniform heating of the Diamond structure during the constant temperature process, a 1 mm thick plate is added beneath the entire structure, integrating it into a cohesive unit. In the present configuration, the bottom surface of the TPMS heat sink is defined as a boundary heat source, while the two ends of the channel are specified as the inlet and outlet, respectively. To facilitate consistent visualization and quantitative comparison among different structures, a channel segment with a total length of 60 mm, centered on the heat sink region, is selected as the diagram area for image export and post-processing, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This selection ensures that the extracted flow and thermal fields primarily reflect the interaction between the fluid and the heat sink structure, while minimizing the influence of inlet and outlet boundary effects.

To more clearly demonstrate the enhancement in heat transfer performance achieved by the Diamond structure, a conventional fin structure (Fin), which is widely used in practical heat exchanger applications and frequently adopted as a benchmark in previous studies, is selected for comparison. Numerous researchers [20,28] have employed fin-based heat sinks as reference configurations when evaluating the thermal performance of advanced porous or lattice structures, owing to their well-established flow and heat transfer characteristics. To ensure that the flow and heat transfer conditions of the Fin structure are closely aligned with those of the Diamond structure, thereby avoiding decisive differences in heat transfer performance, the fluid contact surface area of the Fin structure is adjusted to approximate that of the Diamond structure. This approach aims to control variables in the experiment, allowing for a more accurate verification of the impact of structural characteristics on heat transfer performance. Table 1 presents the flow parameters measured for each structure using 3D modeling software, where A represents the surface area in contact with the fluid, and Dh denotes the hydraulic diameter [29]. The hydraulic diameter, whose calculation formula is given in Eq. (1), is defined as four times the ratio of the cross-sectional flow area (AS) to the corresponding wetted perimeter (P), and is widely adopted as an effective characteristic length for describing complex and non-circular flow passages. By incorporating both the flow area and the wetted perimeter, Dh provides a unified metric to characterize the geometric features of irregular channels, thereby enabling consistent evaluation and comparison of flow resistance, Reynolds number, and convective heat transfer behavior among different structures. The parameters involved in Eq. (1) are schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.

2.3. Boundary conditions and equations
A boundary heat source is applied to the bottom surface of the TPMS heat sink using the heat dissipation rate method, which corresponds to a constant power heating approach. Specifically, a total heat dissipation rate of 12 W is prescribed, resulting in a nearly uniform bottom plate temperature of approximately 100 °C under steady-state conditions. At the inlet, a normal velocity boundary condition is imposed, with the inlet fluid initially set at 293.15 K, while a pressure outlet boundary condition is specified at the outlet to ensure stable flow development and suppress potential backflow. All solid–fluid interfaces are treated as no-slip walls.
Considering the non-isothermal flow in the fluid domain, the turbulent heat transfer is modeled using the Kays–Crawford model, which accounts for the coupling between turbulence and thermal transport. The Kays–Crawford model is employed because it accounts for the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number with local flow conditions, making it more suitable for predicting heat transfer in complex TPMS geometries with strong turbulence and flow mixing than the Reynolds analogy or conventional SST-based thermal models. In practical water-cooled heat exchanger applications, the coolant velocity typically ranges from 0.4 to 1.5 m/s. However, due to the limited geometric scale of the present model and to avoid excessively small temperature differences at high flow velocities, the inlet velocity is set to 0.4 m/s in this study.
Since the fluid flow within the TPMS structure is characterized by strong geometric confinement, repeated acceleration–deceleration, and pronounced vortex generation, the turbulence modeling strategy must be capable of capturing strain-rate-dependent dissipation and rotational effects. Based on the Reynolds number estimation Eq. (2), the flow regime inside the TPMS structure lies in the transitional-to-moderate turbulent range (Re ≈ 2000–6000 at 0.8 m/s), where neither fully developed turbulence assumptions nor laminar simplifications are strictly valid.
(2)
where ρ is the fluid density, u is the fluid velocity, Dh is the hydraulic diameter, and μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity.
The RNG k-ε model is therefore adopted, as it is derived from renormalization group theory and introduces an additional term in the dissipation rate equation that explicitly accounts for the interaction between turbulence dissipation and local strain rate. This feature enables the model to dynamically adjust turbulent viscosity in regions of strong curvature, rotation, and vortex stretching, which are dominant flow characteristics in TPMS-based internal channels. In contrast, the realizable k-ε model primarily improves the mathematical realizability of the Reynolds stresses and enhances predictions for separated shear flows, but it still relies on an eddy-viscosity formulation that is less sensitive to rotational turbulence modulation in confined porous geometries.
The SST k-ω model, while offering superior near-wall resolution and improved prediction of adverse pressure gradient effects, is highly sensitive to inlet turbulence properties and requires refined near-wall meshing to fully exploit its advantages [30]. In complex TPMS structures with a large wetted surface area and highly convoluted flow paths, this requirement significantly increases computational cost and may introduce numerical stiffness. As reported in recent internal flow studies employing TPMS-enhanced channels [31], both SST k-ω and realizable k-ε models can provide reasonable predictions; however, the RNG k-ε model offers a more robust balance between numerical stability, rotational flow sensitivity, and computational efficiency for moderate Reynolds number regimes dominated by vortex-driven heat transfer.
The turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate ε equations for simulating the flow state of the fluid in the TPMS structure based on the RNG k-ε turbulence model are given by the following equations, respectively:
(3)
(4)
where ui is the velocity component in the i direction, μt is the turbulent viscosity, Gk is the generating term for the turbulent kinetic energy k due to the mean velocity gradient, G1ε and G2ε are empirical constants, αk and αϵ are the Prandtl numbers corresponding to the turbulent kinetic energy k and the dissipation rate ε, respectively, and Sk and Sε are user-defined source terms.
The flow of the fluid in the TPMS structure is consistent with the conservation equations of momentum, energy and mass, which are as follows:
(5)
(6)
(7)
where ρ is the density; U is the velocity vector; μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity; p is the pressure; t is the time; and u, v and ω are the components of U in the x, y and z directions, respectively;
(8)
(9)
(10)
where λ is the thermal conductivity.
The equation for conservation of energy is as follows:
(11)
where T is the fluid temperature; h is the heat transfer coefficient; Cp is the constant pressure specific heat capacity of the fluid; and ST is the viscous dissipation term.
In the numerical model, wall roughness is considered using the sand-grain roughness approach, where the equivalent sand-grain roughness height is determined based on the powder particle size distribution shown in Fig. 6 and is set to 70 μm in this study. This treatment partially compensates for the inherent discrepancy between the smooth-wall assumption in simulations and the surface roughness introduced by the SLM-fabricated TPMS structures.
Based on all the aforementioned settings, the boundary conditions employed in the numerical simulations are summarized in Table 2.

In evaluating the convective heat transfer performance, it is necessary to refer to the surface heat transfer coefficient h, the Nusselt number Nu, and the friction coefficient f. The corresponding equations are shown in Eq. (12) and Eq. (13).
(12)
where h is the surface heat transfer coefficient, Q is the heat flux, and Tw and Tf are the wall and fluid temperatures, respectively.
(13)
where Nu is the Nusselt number, Dh is the hydraulic diameter, and k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.
The values of Tw and Tf in Eq. (12) are evaluated using the calculation group function in COMSOL, which enables accurate determination of average or extreme values over the selected domains. Here, Tw is defined as the area-averaged temperature of the heat sink structure over all solid surfaces in contact with the fluid, excluding the bottom heating surface and external boundary regions, while Tf represents the volume-averaged temperature of the fluid domain. The corresponding formulations can be expressed as follows:
(14)
(15)
where T(x) denotes the local temperature field, and Vw and Vf represent the volumes of the solid domain and the fluid domain, respectively.
2.4. Numerical scheme
To ensure the numerical stability, convergence reliability, and computational efficiency of the simulations, appropriate solver configurations are implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. The solver settings are carefully selected according to the characteristics of the coupled non-isothermal turbulent flow problem, taking into account the strong fluid–structure interactions and complex flow patterns induced by the TPMS geometry. The detailed solver configurations, including the solution strategy, discretization scheme, and convergence criteria, are summarized in Table 3.

2.5. Mesh generation and independence verification
An unstructured mesh generation method is employed to mesh the Diamond-Solid structure with a relative density of 20 %. The results of numerical simulations can vary depending on the level of mesh refinement [[32], [33], [34]]. In this paper, six different meshing methods are used, and the element size parameters for each meshing method are Table 4. As shown in Fig. 4, as the number of mesh elements increases, the pressure drop (Δp) of the fluid passing through the Diamond-Solid structure tends to decrease, while the conductive heat flux (Q) exhibits an upward trend. When the number of mesh elements reaches 417,083, Δp begins to stabilize and shows a slight rebound. Upon reaching 711,598 mesh elements, Δp slightly decreases, and at this point, the Q value also starts to stabilize. Excessive mesh numbers can significantly increase computational time costs. Therefore, based on the mesh generation method used for the Diamond-Solid structure with a relative density of 20 % at 711,598 mesh elements, the same approach is applied to mesh the remaining structural models in this study.

As shown in Fig. 5, the generated fluid–solid coupled mesh exhibits pronounced boundary-layer refinement near the fluid–wall interfaces to accurately capture velocity and temperature gradients in the near-wall regions. Corner mesh refinement is also applied at sharp geometric features to enhance the resolution of complex flow structures. From the solid domain, it can be observed that a sufficiently refined mesh is employed over the curved surfaces of the Diamond structure, ensuring an adequate representation of its intricate three-dimensional geometry. In addition, the mesh in the empty channel regions shows a regular and uniform distribution, which contributes to numerical stability and reliable flow development.

3. Experimental verification
3.1. Prototyping
In this study, SLM technology is employed to fabricate specific TPMS and fin (Fin) heat sink structures using CuCrZr alloy powder. The particle size distribution of the CuCrZr powder is presented in the corresponding Fig. 6, indicating that the powder particles are predominantly within the optimal size range for SLM processing and exhibit good sphericity and flowability. The powder morphology observed from scanning electron microscopy images further confirms a relatively smooth surface and uniform particle size distribution, providing favorable conditions for achieving dense and high-quality printed structures.
Based on the powder characteristics, the key SLM process parameters adopted in this study—including laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, layer thickness, substrate preheating temperature, shielding gas, and oxygen content in the build chamber—are summarized in Table 5. Appropriate selection and coordination of these parameters are essential to ensure high densification, geometric accuracy, and stable thermo-mechanical performance of the fabricated structures.

A schematic illustration of the SLM fabrication process is shown in Fig. 7(a). After the build platform descends by one layer thickness, the powder spreading mechanism transfers a thin layer of powder from the powder reservoir to the build area. Subsequently, the laser selectively melts the powder layer according to the predefined slicing path and scanning strategy. Under the protection of an argon atmosphere, the oxygen content inside the chamber is strictly controlled, effectively preventing oxidation, combustion, and other undesirable phenomena during the melting process. The final fabricated TPMS and fin heat sink samples are presented in Fig. 7(b).

3.2. Fluid heat dissipation test platform
To verify fluid–thermal–solid coupled simulations, a fluid cooling test platform was built to compare numerical results with experimental conditions and evaluate the performance of different heat sinks. The platform consists of three parts: fluid circuit, heating section, and sensing system. For the fluid circuit, an integrated water tank–pump device (AI-U8-T, Dongyuan Ruikong) was used to circulate and store fluid, with a maximum head of 8 m, flow rate up to 1200 L/h, and operating range of −20 to 55 °C. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the device includes filling, inlet, and outlet ports with G1/4 threads for quick-fit connections. A 220 V–12 V adapter controlled the pump speed via a 4P connector. Transparent PP tubes (OD 12 mm, ID 10 mm) and PV12 quick connectors were used for all pipelines, ensuring sealing, corrosion resistance, and easy assembly. The sensing system included flow, pressure, and temperature monitoring. Flow rate was measured by an LCD-05OFZAT digital meter (30–1200 L/h, ±5 %). Pressure drop was recorded by two YB-80A gauges (20 kPa, 0.4 class accuracy) at inlet and outlet. Two WD-801 temperature transmitters (−50–600 °C, ±1 %FS) were used for inlet/outlet monitoring to evaluate fluid thermal differences and detect possible blockages. This setup ensured reliable correlation between experimental data and simulations.
3.3. Measurement uncertainty analysis
In accordance with the recommendations of Moffat [35], the uncertainties of both measured and derived quantities were evaluated using the method of propagation of error. The uncertainties of directly measured quantities are summarized as follows: flow rate was measured with an LCD-05OFZAT digital meter (range: 30–1200 L/h, accuracy: ±5 %), pressure drop was obtained using calibrated YB-80A gauges (range: 0–20 kPa, class 0.4, accuracy: ±0.4 %FS), and temperatures were monitored using WD-801 thermocouples (−50–600 °C, accuracy: ±1 %FS).
For derived quantities, such as pressure drop per unit length (Δp/L) and temperature difference ΔT, the uncertainty was estimated by combining the partial derivatives of each variable with respect to its measured quantities. The general error propagation formula is expressed as:
(16)
where R is the derived parameter, xi are the independent measured quantities, and δxi are their respective uncertainties. Based on this method, the estimated uncertainties of the key derived quantities in this study are.
●
Δp/L: ±4.5 %
●
Temperature difference ΔT: ±2.0 %
These values are consistent with uncertainty ranges reported in similar experimental studies [20,23], confirming that the observed differences between structures exceed the bounds of experimental uncertainty and thus validate the reliability of the obtained results.
In permeation experiments on SLM-fabricated CuCrZr TPMS porous structures, a systematic discrepancy between experimentally measured and numerically predicted pressure drops is unavoidable. One of the primary origins of this deviation lies in the inherent difference between the pronounced surface roughness of additively manufactured flow channels and the idealized smooth-wall assumption adopted in numerical simulations. Partially melted powders, surface irregularities, and layer-wise stacking effects introduced during the SLM process inevitably increase flow resistance and intensify local vortex formation, particularly for TPMS structures with small hydraulic diameters and complex internal topologies.
To compensate for this discrepancy without explicitly prescribing wall roughness parameters, a hydraulic-diameter-based pressure-drop correction approach is employed. A continuous functional relationship between the correction factor and the hydraulic diameter is introduced, with its functional form determined through experimental fitting. This strategy enables an effective reconciliation between the realistic flow behavior of SLM-fabricated porous structures and the smooth-wall assumption inherent in numerical simulations, while preserving the overall comparative validity of the results:
(17)
3.4. Experimental results and discussion
Following experimental platform construction, thermal and hydrodynamic performance of all heat sink configurations was rigorously characterized to validate numerical models. Pressure drop measurements were conducted using calibrated YB80A digital manometers (0–20 kPa range, 0.1 % accuracy) installed at structural inlets/outlets (Fig. 8), precisely quantifying TPMS-induced flow resistance. Temperature validation addressed system-level discrepancies between experimental recirculating flow and simulated unidirectional conditions by tracking the fluid temperature difference between initial and stabilized states, with dual thermocouples (Fig. 8) simultaneously monitoring inlet/outlet temperatures to confirm flow continuity while detecting potential blockages through anomalous readings. This comprehensive approach ensured reliable correlation between empirical data and computational predictions.

Table 6 presents a comparative analysis between experimentally measured and numerically simulated data for fluid pressure drop (Δp/L) and temperature difference (ΔT) across various structures. The experimental pressure drop measurements consistently exceeded simulation results, with an overall average deviation of 7.4 % across all tested configurations. This systematic discrepancy likely stems from multiple contributing factors: the simplified treatment of flow resistance in numerical simulations fails to fully account for practical considerations such as wall roughness and local flow separation; the selected pressure measurement locations in experiments may coincide with regions of greater flow disturbance; furthermore, inherent differences exist between the idealized boundary conditions employed in simulations and actual experimental conditions.

To further illustrate the consistency and reliability of the data presented in Table 6, a comparative plot with error bars was constructed to visualize both the experimentally measured and numerically simulated results. For each structural configuration, multiple independent experimental measurements were conducted to quantify data dispersion, and the corresponding statistical uncertainties were calculated. These uncertainties are represented as error bars in Fig. 9, allowing a direct assessment of the variability and repeatability of the experimental data relative to the numerical predictions. The resulting error-bar plots provide a clearer comparison between simulation and experiment, demonstrating that the majority of numerical results fall within the experimental uncertainty ranges, thereby further supporting the validity of the numerical model.

Notably, despite these deviations, the experimental and simulated data demonstrate excellent agreement in their variation trends, particularly when examining the pressure drop characteristics across structures with varying relative densities (e.g., from DSolid-20 % to DSolid-50 %), where both datasets exhibit the expected monotonic increase, thereby validating the numerical model's overall predictive capability for flow behavior. Regarding temperature differences, the experimental values were consistently slightly lower than the simulation results, with an average deviation of approximately 8.3 %. This discrepancy may be attributed to factors such as thermocouple measurement errors or system heat dissipation during experiments.
4. Discussion of results
4.1. Mobility analysis
This section analyzes the flow performance of fluids passing through Diamond-Solid, Diamond-Sheet, and Fin structures with different relative densities, including fluid velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and vorticity distribution. The relative motion between the fluid and the heat exchange surface accelerates, leading to the formation of a thinner thermal boundary layer—the fluid layer near the surface where heat transfer occurs. A thinner thermal boundary layer facilitates faster heat transfer from the surface to the fluid, thereby enhancing convective heat transfer efficiency [36]. The magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy fully reflects the degree of turbulence in the fluid. Greater turbulence increases fluid mixing, which improves the efficiency of heat transfer [[37], [38], [39]]. An increase in vorticity leverages vortex effects to rapidly transport high-temperature fluid to low-temperature regions, further enhancing fluid heat exchange efficiency [40,41].
Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12 present cross-sectional distributions of flow velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and vorticity for three distinct structural configurations, respectively. Under the boundary condition of an inlet velocity of 0.4 m/s, the results demonstrate a significant increase in flow velocity with rising relative density for both TPMS structures. Notably, the Diamond-Sheet configuration exhibits substantially higher internal flow velocities compared to other structures, while the Fin structure maintains relatively constant flow characteristics throughout its domain.

The turbulent kinetic energy distributions reveal a consistent increasing trend from the inlet to outlet regions, mirroring the velocity field observations. Similarly, the vorticity distributions demonstrate homogeneous patterns that correlate well with the corresponding velocity fields. These findings collectively suggest that while both TPMS structures exhibit density-dependent flow acceleration, the Diamond-Sheet configuration facilitates more pronounced fluid motion, as evidenced by its superior velocity performance and coherent turbulent structures.
In the quantitative characterization of vorticity distribution within heat sink structures, this study systematically elucidates the vortex features through cross-sectional vorticity streamline vector plots presented in Fig. 12. Quantitative analysis reveals that the Diamond-Solid structure exhibits predominant laminar characteristics, with vorticity streamlines displaying stratified vertical distributions, where localized vortices only emerge at 50 % relative density. In contrast, the Diamond-Sheet structure demonstrates a distinct vorticity pattern: well-defined and spatially uniform vortex clusters are observed across the 20 %–50 % relative density range. This fundamental difference originates from the unique lamellar topology of Diamond-Sheet, which establishes distributed thermal convection channels through the formation of multi-scale vortex pairs, thereby significantly enhancing heat transfer efficiency. Notably, the vorticity distribution in Fin structures suggests a laminar-dominant heat transfer mechanism, failing to develop effective vortex-enhanced heat exchange structures.
Fig. 13 presents the velocity contour distributions at five axial locations (inlet, 1/4L, 1/2L, 3/4L, and outlet) along the flow-perpendicular direction (y-z plane) for each heat sink configuration. Quantitative analysis reveals that all structures except the Fin (whose velocity gradient is obscured by scale limitations) exhibit a distinct velocity peak at the 1/4L position, with 40–60 % higher velocity magnitude compared to the inlet. Cross-referencing with the vorticity analysis in Fig. 12, this acceleration zone corresponds to the laminar-to-turbulent transition region, where chaotic vorticity streamlines indicate flow separation and secondary flow generation. The flow regime transition leads to localized kinetic energy concentration, creating high-velocity zones. Although the current sectional sampling density is insufficient for precise spatial mapping of maximum velocity points, the engineering significance of the 1/4L position as a characteristic region is evident: it serves as both the hydrodynamic reconfiguration node and the critical zone for flow passage optimization. Strategic geometric modifications in this region can effectively balance the trade-off between turbulence-enhanced heat transfer and flow resistance.

Fig. 14 presents a three-dimensional perspective of streamline diagrams illustrating fluid flow through different structures. Both the Diamond-Solid and Diamond-Sheet structures exhibit complex and chaotic flow patterns, which are primarily attributed to the flow-disturbing effect of the TPMS geometry within the fluid domain. It is also evident that the streamlines are constrained within the fluid domain, displaying a state of organized chaos. By examining the cross-sectional view of the fluid outlet, it can be observed that the Diamond-Sheet structure forms more complete and pronounced vortices compared to the Diamond-Solid structure, with larger vortex diameters and a centrally symmetric distribution. One of the main reasons for vortex formation is the presence of flow obstacles. The complex flow geometry and tortuous flow channels alter the fluid flow path, thereby generating vorticity. As shown in Fig. 14, the Diamond-Sheet structure exerts a greater obstructive effect on the fluid compared to the Diamond-Solid structure. Additionally, the cross-section of the Diamond-Solid structure clearly reveals through-holes perpendicular to the fluid flow direction, which facilitate fluid movement. In contrast, the Diamond-Sheet structure lacks such through-holes and relies on a few gaps on the sides for fluid guidance, significantly disrupting the fluid flow.

The data presented in Fig. 15 further confirm that, as the relative density of the TPMS structures increases, the flow performance of the fluid within the porous domain is significantly enhanced, and the increasing trend becomes more pronounced. The Reynolds number (Re), which serves as a key indicator of flow regime transition, is primarily governed by the flow velocity v and the hydraulic diameter Dh. In low-Re laminar flow conditions, fluid motion is relatively orderly and weak, and heat transfer is dominated by thermal conduction. In contrast, at higher Re, the flow gradually transitions into a turbulent regime, where convective heat transfer becomes dominant and exhibits substantially higher heat transfer capability. Generally, flows with Re below 2000 can be regarded as laminar, those between 2000 and 4000 are in a transitional regime, and flows exceeding Re = 4000 are typically considered fully turbulent.

As shown in Fig. 15 (a), the Reynolds numbers of both Diamond-type structures are mainly distributed within the range of 3000–4500, indicating that the flow inside the TPMS channels predominantly lies in the laminar–turbulent transition regime. Structures with lower relative density generally exhibit Re values below 3500, whereas the Diamond-Solid structure with a relative density of 50 % achieves a maximum Re of 4442, representing an overall increase of 121.44 % compared with the Fin structure (Re = 2006). Although the Diamond-Solid structure exhibits slightly higher Re values than the Diamond-Sheet structure, this difference is largely attributed to its larger hydraulic diameter, which compensates for its relatively lower flow velocity.
However, when examining the internal flow characteristics in more detail, the Diamond-Sheet structure demonstrates distinct advantages in terms of turbulence activation. As shown in Fig. 15 (b), the internal average flow velocity of the Diamond-Sheet structure is consistently higher than that of the Diamond-Solid structure at the same relative density, indicating stronger local acceleration and enhanced flow disturbance within the porous channels. This elevated flow velocity directly contributes to the promotion of turbulent transport processes.
Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 15 (c), the Diamond-Sheet structure exhibits significantly higher turbulent kinetic energy compared with the Diamond-Solid structure. This indicates that the sheet-based topology is more effective in converting the mean flow energy into turbulent fluctuations, thereby strengthening momentum and thermal mixing within the flow field. Such enhanced turbulent kinetic energy is a hallmark of improved turbulence triggering capability. In addition, the vorticity distribution, as shown in Fig. 15 (d), further highlights the superior flow disturbance characteristics of the Diamond-Sheet structure. The higher average vorticity levels observed within the Diamond-Sheet configuration suggest the formation of more intense and persistent vortex structures, which play a critical role in disrupting the thermal boundary layer and enhancing convective heat transfer.
Overall, compared with the conventional Fin structure, both Diamond-based TPMS configurations exhibit markedly improved flow performance. Nevertheless, the two Diamond variants rely on fundamentally different mechanisms: the Diamond-Solid structure primarily enhances convective heat transfer by increasing the effective hydraulic diameter and promoting bulk flow, whereas the Diamond-Sheet structure achieves superior heat transfer performance by intensifying local flow acceleration, turbulent kinetic energy, and vorticity generation, thereby providing a more effective turbulence triggering mechanism.
4.2. Heat transfer analysis
This subsection analyses the temperature variations resulting from fluid passing through different heat sink structures for both numerical simulation and experimental cases. At the same time, the heat transfer performance under different heat sink structures is analysed in depth, including h and Nu. A higher h implies more heat exchanged per unit area and a faster rate of heat transfer, whereas the Nu not only reflects the merit of h, but also evaluates the overall performance of the heat transfer in conjunction with the structural and fluidity properties.
As shown in Fig. 16, after the heat sink structure is heated by the base plate, the 20 °C fluid water passes through and increases in temperature, creating a temperature difference between the outlet end and the inlet end. As the relative density of the Diamond structure increases, the temperature difference also increases, and the temperature difference of the Diamond-Sheet structure is larger than that of the Diamond-Solid structure.

Through the partition calculation function in the simulation software, we can get the specific heat transfer performance under each structure. As shown in Fig. 17 (a), the h of the Diamond structure shows a clear increasing trend as the relative density increases, and the Diamond-Sheet structure is much higher than that of the Diamond-Solid structure, and the trend of increasing with the relative density becomes more obvious. As shown in Fig. 17 (b), the Nu shows a similar trend to h, and the Diamond-Sheet structure is still overall better than the Diamond-Solid structure and Fin structure. It can be seen that when evaluated in combination with h and Dh, which are important influencing factors for both heat transfer performance and mobility, the Diamond-Sheet structure still demonstrates superior thermal mobility properties, in contrast to Re. Compared to the Fin structure, the Diamond-Sheet structure with 50 % relative density increases both h and Nu by about 3 times, which reflects the great heat transfer performance of the TPMS structure heat sink.

Furthermore, it can be observed that the heat transfer performance of the Fin structure is generally between that of the Diamond-Sheet structure and the Diamond-Solid structure. Only 40 % and 50 % of the Diamond-Solid structures slightly exceed the Fin structure in Nu. The overall heat transfer performance of the Diamond-Solid structure is even inferior to that of the Fin structure, which indicates that in the comparison of heat sink structures, the sheet-shaped heat sink exhibits more significant advantages compared to the rod-shaped structure. Similarly, as a Fin structure heat sink with a sheet shape, it has a relatively large heat dissipation surface area, enabling it to conduct more sufficient heat exchange with the surrounding medium per unit time, thereby effectively enhancing the heat dissipation efficiency. However, due to its morphological characteristics, when the rod-shaped structure serves as a heat sink channel, its main function is only limited to some improvement in promoting the flow of the internal fluid, but the improvement in the overall heat dissipation efficiency is far less than that of the sheet-shaped heat sink, and it is difficult to meet the urgent need for high-efficiency heat dissipation in complex application scenarios with high requirements for heat dissipation performance.
It is worth noting that, as shown in Fig. 17 (c), the fluid contact area of the Diamond-Sheet structure is much higher than that of the Diamond-Solid structure. Theoretically, a larger heat exchange area can be formed. However, as the relative density increases, the contact area of the Diamond-Solid structure gradually increases, while that of the Diamond-Sheet structure gradually decreases. This indicates that the heat exchange area and the heat transfer performance of the heat sink structure are not completely correlated. One cannot fully rely on the heat exchange area of the heat sink to evaluate its heat transfer performance. Instead, a comprehensive consideration should be made in combination with the particularities of the heat exchanger structure.
Meanwhile, the heat sink temperature provides the most intuitive indicator for evaluating the heat dissipation performance of Diamond structures with different morphologies. In this study, numerical simulations and experimental measurements of temperature distributions were conducted for Diamond structures with varying morphologies and volume fractions, as well as for the conventional finned structure, with the aim of reflecting their actual operating performance through the heat sink temperature. In the numerical simulations, a volume-averaging approach was adopted, whereby the temperature values over the entire solid domain were averaged to obtain the representative heat sink temperature, as defined in Eq. (14). As illustrated in Fig. 18, under identical bottom heat source conditions, the Diamond-Solid structures exhibit generally higher average temperatures than the Diamond-Sheet counterparts. Specifically, the Diamond-Solid structure with the lowest volume fraction shows an average temperature of 62.41 °C, whereas the Diamond-Sheet structure with the highest volume fraction achieves a significantly lower average temperature of only 49.67 °C. This trend clearly indicates that increasing the volume fraction leads to a reduction in the average heat sink temperature, highlighting the enhanced convective heat transfer capability associated with sheet-type TPMS architectures and higher relative densities. Furthermore, the temperature contours reveal steeper temperature gradients near the heated base and smoother gradients along the flow direction for Diamond-Sheet structures, implying more effective heat removal and thermal diffusion within the porous matrix. In contrast, the fin structure exhibits a markedly higher average temperature of 79.77 °C, demonstrating the inherent limitations of traditional finned designs when compared with TPMS-based topological structures. Overall, these results confirm that sheet-type TPMS heat sinks are more suitable for high-performance heat transfer applications.

In the experimental evaluation, the same test rig shown in Fig. 8 was employed to ensure consistency. Under identical heating power, cooling water circulation rate, inlet temperature, and flow conditions, the transient temperature evolution of heat sinks with different morphologies and volume fractions was monitored over a duration of 5 min. The recorded temperature corresponds to the reading of the silicone rubber heating pad, which represents the bottom temperature of the heat sink. In addition, two reference cases—an empty pipe and an at-rest condition—were introduced to characterize the cooling performance without a heat sink under water cooling and the purely natural cooling behavior without forced convection, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 19, under the same heat input, the at-rest reference rapidly reached approximately 100 °C within 5 min, indicating extremely limited heat dissipation capability, whereas the empty pipe case stabilized at around 65 °C. The fin structure exhibited a slightly improved performance, with a final temperature of approximately 62 °C. By contrast, the Diamond structures with different morphologies and volume fractions demonstrated significantly enhanced thermal performance, and their relative ranking is in good agreement with the numerical predictions. Specifically, the Diamond-Sheet structure with 50 % volume fraction showed the lowest steady-state temperature of about 52 °C, while the Diamond-Solid structure with 20 % volume fraction exhibited the highest temperature among the TPMS designs, reaching approximately 60 °C. These results confirm that both the sheet/solid morphology and the volume fraction of TPMS structures exert a pronounced influence on heat dissipation performance under realistic operating conditions, thereby providing direct experimental validation of the numerical simulation outcomes.

In the analysis of convective heat flux within the fluid domain, the volume-averaged numerical evaluation method is likewise employed to quantify and compare the solid–fluid interfacial convective heat transfer. Convective heat flux fundamentally characterizes the ability of the fluid to remove thermal energy from the solid walls through convection, and is jointly governed by the local temperature gradient, flow velocity, and turbulence intensity. As illustrated in Fig. 20, all heat sink configurations exhibit pronounced accumulation of convective heat flux near the downstream end and outlet regions. This behavior is primarily attributed to the development of the flow along the main flow direction, where thermal energy generated by the bottom heat source is continuously transported downstream and progressively accumulates, leading to enhanced temperature gradients and stronger heat transfer driving forces at the outlet. A comparative analysis further reveals that both the morphology and volume fraction of the Diamond structures exert a significant influence on the magnitude of convective heat flux, which generally increases with increasing volume fraction. Notably, the sheet-based Diamond structures consistently produce higher convective heat flux than their solid counterparts. This enhancement can be ascribed to the ability of the sheet-type TPMS geometry to induce stronger local flow acceleration, elevated turbulent kinetic energy, and intensified vortex generation in the downstream region, thereby promoting more effective fluid–wall thermal interaction. Consequently, the persistent concentration of convective heat flux at the bottom outlet region for structures with volume fractions ranging from 20 % to 50 % is not incidental, but rather the result of the coupled effects of structure-induced flow disturbance and streamwise heat accumulation. This observation provides valuable guidance for heat sink design, suggesting that incorporating flow-disturbing and heat-transfer-enhancing features near the downstream bottom region may further improve the overall thermal performance.

4.3. Comprehensive heat transfer performance evaluation
Heat sink structure design can not only pursue too high heat transfer performance and ignore the fluidity of the mass, and can not be in order to reduce its flow resistance at the expense of heat transfer performance. In the above analysis, this paper conclude that Diamond-Solid and Diamond-Sheet structures have advantages in fluidity and heat transfer, respectively. In order to compare the combined heat transfer performance of the two structures more clearly, this subsection analyses the degree of change in flow resistance while improving the heat transfer performance of each structure.
(18)
where f is the coefficient of friction, Δp is the pressure drop at the inlet and outlet of the fluid, and L is the total length of the structure through which the fluid passes.
The friction factor f and pressure drop are two key indicators characterizing the flow resistance of heat sink structures. As indicated by Eq. (18), when geometric parameters and operating conditions remain constant, the pressure difference Δp between the inlet and outlet serves as a dominant factor governing the friction factor, and a clear positive correlation exists between them. To quantitatively evaluate the flow performance of TPMS heat sinks, a normalized comparison of both pressure drop and friction factor was conducted using the conventional fin structure as a reference.
As shown in Fig. 21, both the pressure drop and friction factor of the Diamond structures increase markedly with increasing relative density. Notably, the Diamond-Sheet structure with a relative density of 50 % exhibits an increase in pressure drop of up to 1711 % compared with the fin structure, accompanied by a substantial rise in the friction factor. These results indicate that while TPMS structures significantly enhance convective heat transfer through complex internal topologies and intensified turbulent disturbances, such performance gains are inevitably achieved at the expense of flow permeability. In particular, the sheet-based TPMS configuration, characterized by a reduced equivalent hydraulic diameter, continuous curved contraction–expansion channels, and strong vortex generation, considerably amplifies viscous dissipation and local energy losses, leading to a rapid accumulation of overall flow resistance.

In order to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the heat sink, this paper uses the PEC coefficient [42] to assess different structures. The PEC evaluation coefficient takes into account both the flow performance and the heat transfer performance of the heat sink structure. By comparing with the reference heat sink, the ratio of Nu to f is calculated. Here, the reference heat sink is the Fin structure, and its expression is Eq. (19). Among them, Nu and Nu0, f and f0 are respectively the Nusselt numbers and friction coefficients of the Diamond structure and the Fin structure. The PEC coefficient of the Fin structure is defaulted to 1.
(19)
As shown in Fig. 22, the comprehensive heat transfer evaluation coefficient (PEC) of the Diamond-Sheet structure increases with the relative density. Among the tested cases, only the Diamond-Sheet structures with relative densities of 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % exhibit higher PEC values than the Fin structure, indicating superior overall heat transfer performance. This enhancement is mainly attributed to their larger heat transfer coefficient ℎ and Nusselt number (Nu). However, it should be noted that the intricate internal channels of the Diamond structure, while improving heat transfer, also markedly increase the fluid friction coefficient and the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet, and intensify turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity, reflecting stronger flow instability. Therefore, under the evaluation conditions considering both heat transfer and flow performance, the Diamond-Sheet structure shows an advantage over the commonly used Fin heat sink only at relative densities between 30 % and 50 %, which is consistent with the findings of Tang's study [20]. This indicates that under the evaluation conditions considering both the heat transfer performance and the flow performance, compared with the other structures in the experiment, the Diamond-Sheet structure with a relative density of 50 % can achieve the optimal performance and is better than the Fin structure heat sink that is commonly used.

5. Conclusion
This study systematically investigated the thermal–hydraulic performance of TPMS-based Diamond heat sinks fabricated from CuCrZr alloy, with relative densities ranging from 20 % to 50 %, and benchmarked against a conventional fin structure. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows.
1)
Through a systematic investigation of Diamond structures with relative densities ranging from 20 % to 50 %, a significant flow enhancement phenomenon was observed. The increase in relative density led to a dramatic rise in pressure drop (Δp) and friction factor (f), accompanied by substantial improvements in internal flow velocity (v), turbulent kinetic energy (k), and vorticity. Specifically, the average flow velocities (v) in the 50 % Diamond-Sheet and Diamond-Solid structures reached 0.99 m/s and 0.86 m/s, representing increases of 52.88 % and 51.28 %, respectively, compared to their 20 % counterparts. Notably, the Diamond-Sheet structure, featuring interconnected plate-like barriers, exhibited superior turbulence generation compared to the Diamond-Solid structure with open-cell porosity, highlighting its potential for enhanced fluid mixing.
2)
The average convective heat transfer coefficient (h) and Nusselt number (Nu) exhibited a consistent upward trend with increasing relative density. The Diamond-Sheet structure consistently outperformed both the Fin and Diamond-Solid configurations, achieving an average h of 112714.4 W/(m2·K) at 50 % relative density—176.22 % and 187.83 % higher than the Fin and Diamond-Solid structures, respectively. This finding underscores the inferior suitability of rod-based Diamond-Solid structures for thermal dissipation, whereas plate-based architectures (Diamond-Sheet and Fin) demonstrate optimal heat exchange characteristics.
3)
Contrary to conventional expectations, the fluid-contact surface area of the Diamond-Sheet structure decreased by ∼244 mm2 when the relative density increased from 20 % to 50 %. This counterintuitive result suggests that the dominant heat transfer mechanism in Diamond-based heat sinks is forced convection rather than conduction. The reduction in hydraulic diameter (Dh) and flow passage geometry intensifies fluid turbulence, thereby enhancing thermal convection efficiency.
4)
Using the Fin structure as a baseline (PEC = 1), the Diamond-Sheet structures with relative densities of 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % achieved superior PEC values, with the 50 % case reaching 1.55. This demonstrates their enhanced combined thermal and hydrodynamic performance within this density range, highlighting the potential of TPMS-based designs for advanced heat exchanger applications.
5)
From a material perspective, the proposed heat sink is fabricated from CuCrZr alloy, which exhibits a thermal conductivity of approximately 320–340 W/(m·K), significantly higher than that of commonly used Al alloys (∼170–220 W/(m·K)) and Ti alloys (∼15–25 W/(m·K)). This intrinsic advantage in thermal conductivity directly contributes to the enhanced heat transfer performance observed in the present study. Moreover, compared with pure copper, CuCrZr offers superior mechanical strength, thermal stability, and resistance to softening at elevated temperatures, ensuring structural integrity and reliability for additively manufactured TPMS heat sinks operating under high thermal loads.
Future research will extend the present work along several targeted and actionable directions. First, additional TPMS architectures beyond the Diamond topology (e.g., Gyroid, IWP, and Schwarz-based structures) will be systematically evaluated to establish broader structure–performance correlations. Second, the influence of unit cell size and multi-scale hierarchical designs will be investigated to further optimize flow organization and heat transfer efficiency. Third, different operating conditions, including higher Reynolds numbers, variable heat fluxes, and alternative coolants, will be explored to assess the robustness of TPMS heat sinks under practical service environments. Finally, objective-driven topology optimization frameworks will be integrated with additive manufacturing constraints to develop next-generation CuCrZr TPMS heat sinks with breakthrough improvements in PEC while maintaining mechanical reliability.
