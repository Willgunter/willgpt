Abstract
To enhance the structural and hydrodynamic performance of open-frame underwater robots, this study proposes a layered porosity optimization approach. Simulations identified an optimal frame ratio of 0.53 and a sidewall opening ratio of 40 %. Flow visualization demonstrated that at a stable speed of 0.4 m/s, sidewall vorticity was reduced by 18.2 % compared with a non-open-frame design. Further computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis examined pressure distribution, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), and vorticity variation under different speeds and motion conditions. The influence of blockage ratio on vortex structures was also investigated, revealing that a ratio of 30 % achieved the best balance, improving lift-to-drag ratio and reducing wake length. Experimental tests validated these findings, showing consistent trends with simulations and confirming the accuracy of the numerical analysis. Overall, the results provide quantitative evidence and a practical design reference for improving the efficiency and stability of open-frame underwater robots.

1. Introduction
Underwater robots have become indispensable tools for tasks such as underwater structural inspection, equipment maintenance, and aquatic biological sampling in recent years. Among existing underwater robot architectures, open-frame structures exhibit superior maneuverability and disturbance resistance compared to closed or cage-type structures. Additionally, open-frame designs offer advantages including lighter weight, larger installation space, and ease of recovery, enabling them to meet diverse mission requirements. While applications of open-frame underwater robots are prevalent, hydrodynamic analysis of such structures remains relatively limited. The unique open-frame configuration and internal device layout significantly influence flow field variations around the robot. Rational design of internal and external structures, coupled with analysis of hydrodynamic characteristics across various layout configurations, is essential for advancing the optimization of open-frame robot architectures.
The geometric configuration of underwater vehicles is closely related to their hydrodynamic performance, directly impacting motion stability and energy efficiency. Studies have shown that optimizing hull shapes can significantly enhance system stability (Cheng et al., 2025; Gan et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), such as wing-shaped modulation for glider stability (Javaid et al., 2017) and hull structural improvements for navigation stability (Lin et al., 2022). For near-bottom exploration and anti-current operations, open-frame structures demonstrate unique advantages: their open configuration effectively reduces flow resistance (Huang et al., 2025), mitigates vortex-induced vibration by guiding flow separation (Sohankar et al., 2025), and provides spatial flexibility for equipment integration. Engineering validation includes ducted Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) drag reduction designs (Won et al., 2015) and open-frame applications for pile foundation inspection robots (Zhang et al., 2024), confirming the structural value. Thus, developing open-frame configurations is essential to balance hydrodynamic performance, structural strength, and functional expansion. However, the rationale behind choosing specific open-frame and perforation ratios, as well as the integration of these parameters, remains insufficiently explored in the literature. Recent studies have investigated the effect of perforation ratios on fluid dynamics, such as the influence of staggered and tilted perforated baffles on flow characteristics in rectangular channels (El Habet et al., 2022) and the effect of perforation rate on the fluid-dynamic coefficient of perforated plates in oscillating flow (Mentzoni and Kristiansen, 2019), but a comprehensive framework for underwater vehicle optimization is still lacking.
The analysis of hydrodynamic performance of underwater robots plays a crucial role in ensuring their operational stability (Lin et al., 2021). revealed drag pulsation mechanisms in disk-type AUVs. In multi-degree-of-freedom motion modeling (Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023), validated complex dynamics of open-frame remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) through CFD-experiment coupling, while (Zhao et al., 2022) identified net buoyancy-induced deflection effects and (Dai et al., 2021) developed a three-mode motion model for deep-sea mining vehicles (Jiang et al., 2025). discussed the impacts of the asymmetric shape, motion patterns, and near-wall motion of ROVs on hydrodynamic coefficients (Gao et al., 2025). analyzed the complex flow coupling between the internal framework and fluid dynamics structure of open-frame underwater towed bodies. These studies have advanced the development of open-frame ROVs. Currently, research on vortex dynamics and turbulence has provided deeper insights into flow patterns and structural stability (Li et al., 2024). investigated vortex dynamics and boundary-layer transition phenomena around rectangular cylinders with varying aspect ratios (Zhong et al., 2025). analyzed the impact of opening ratios on vortex shedding and turbulence around rectangular plates (Dong et al., 2023). experimentally studied the mechanisms of vortex formation and self-sustenance in turbulent boundary layers. However, under open-frame and multi-condition complex structures, interactions between vortex dynamics and turbulence remain underexplored.
Near-wall and confined flow fields significantly affect underwater vehicle performance, with hydrodynamic characteristics varying complexly with wall distance, free-surface position, and obstacle morphology. Research indicates that near-wall effects alter turbulent structures (Tabatabaei Malazi et al., 2024), induce resistance fluctuations (Chen et al., 2020), and even trigger "flow shadow effects" (Gabl et al., 2021). Free-surface interference reduces navigation stability (Mansoorzadeh and Javanmard, 2014; Zhang et al., 2024), while pipe/obstacle environments exacerbate energy loss through wake interference (Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Inter-obstacle spacing is also a critical control parameter (Wang et al., 2014). found that vortex shedding modes of near-wall tandem square cylinders depend on spacing, while (More et al., 2015) confirmed lift/drag correlations for oscillating square cylinders (Kim and Christensen, 2018; Kurtulmuş, 2022). further elucidated flow field variations in parallel wall-bounded cylinder flows. Nevertheless, quantitative investigation of blockage ratio-flow field response mechanisms remains lacking, which is pivotal for enhancing operational efficiency in confined spaces.
This study introduces a hierarchical porosity optimization method to design an open-frame ROV with specific open-frame ratios, addressing current gaps in open-frame underwater robot research. The research objectives are organized as follows: Section 2 presents the overall ROV structural design and describes the CFD setup, including mesh generation strategies and geometric parametrization of sidewall porosity and spacing between upper, middle, and lower baffles, systematically selecting porosity parameters to establish the vehicle design framework. In Section 3, field experiments are conducted to validate the maneuverability and stability of the open-frame underwater robot, while comparisons between measured and simulated velocities verify the reliability of the numerical simulations. Section 4 focuses on numerical simulations to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and flow fields of the ROV under different operational conditions, including forward and lateral motions, as well as the influence of varying blockage ratios on vortex structures and hydrodynamic performance.
In summary, the objectives of this study are to develop a hierarchical porosity optimization method for open-frame ROVs and to systematically investigate their hydrodynamic performance. The main research content includes: (1) designing the ROV structure through geometric parametrization of sidewall porosity and baffle spacing, combined with CFD-based flow analysis and mesh refinement strategies; (2) conducting field experiments to validate the maneuverability and stability of the open-frame ROV, and to verify the accuracy of numerical simulations through velocity comparisons; and (3) performing detailed numerical simulations to analyze flow field variations, vortex structures, and the influence of blockage ratios under different motion conditions. The key innovations of this work are the integration of hierarchical porosity optimization with hydrodynamic mechanism analysis, the identification of sidewall ribs’ role in stabilizing secondary vortices, and the derivation of practical design guidelines—including optimal porosity, blockage ratio, and operational strategies—for enhancing efficiency and stability in open-frame underwater robots.
2. Numerical model development and computational methods
This study innovatively designs an open-frame underwater robot, whose unique structural configuration provides ample space for the installation of operational devices, enabling accommodation of various detection equipment and operational tools. The robot demonstrates flexible underwater operational performance, making it suitable for marine surveying and underwater positioning applications. Notably, this research emphasizes the optimization of parameter settings in numerical models, offering a theoretical basis for enhancing the robot's dynamic performance and stability, thereby addressing previous deficiencies in open-frame structural design.
2.1. Computational domain setup and turbulence model
In prior simulations, the fluid domain was partitioned such that the computational domains for surge and sway motions were divided into internal and external regions, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Computational domains I and III were designated as locally refined regions, while domains II and IV served as external computational domains. The total length of the ROV is denoted as L. The distance from the inlet to the front of the ROV was set to 3L, whereas the distance from the ROV stern to the outlet was 12L. The fluid domain inlet was configured as a velocity inlet, and the outlet as a pressure outlet (0 Pa). Boundaries of the external flow field were defined as walls, with the model surface set as a no-slip wall. Detailed dimensions of the fluid regions are specified in Table 1.

This study employs CFD methods to analyze and evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the open-frame robot. All simulations were conducted using ANSYS Fluent 2023 R2, adopting a pressure-based, transient coupled solver to capture unsteady flow phenomena. The turbulence closure was modeled with the Shear Stress Transport (SST) 
 model (Menter, 1994), which combines the near-wall accuracy of the k-ω formulation with the robustness of the 
 model in the free-stream region through a blending function. This approach is particularly suitable for the Reynolds number range considered in this study (8.0 × 104 to 3.5 × 105), where flow separation, vortex shedding, and turbulence-wall interactions are expected to occur. Spatial discretization of the governing equations was performed using a second-order upwind scheme, and temporal discretization employed a second-order implicit method to ensure accuracy in unsteady simulations.
For incompressible flow, the governing equations solved include the continuity equation and the momentum equations, expressed as:

2.2. Mesh generation and mesh independence verification
After configuring the fluid domain, mesh generation was performed. The generated mesh, depicted in Fig. 2, employs a polyhedral mesh type. Polyhedral meshes offer high adaptability to complex geometries and superior fidelity in representing porous structures, making them well-suited for flow simulations involving intricate configurations. From the outer boundary toward the robot surface, the mesh was gradually refined to balance computational efficiency with accuracy. A prismatic boundary layer mesh was applied on the robot surface to resolve near-wall flows. The dimensionless wall distance (y+) of the first cell adjacent to the robot surface was maintained below 1, ensuring accurate prediction of drag forces. The first-layer thickness was set to 0.12 mm, with a growth rate of 1.2 and a total of four layers in the boundary layer. Mesh refinement was primarily concentrated near the robot surface.

Mesh independence was assessed by examining the drag force of the open-frame robot at a forward velocity of 0.4 m/s with different mesh resolutions, as summarized in Table 2. The results indicate that drag predictions converge with increasing mesh density. When the mesh size reached 5.57 million cells, the drag force became stable, confirming sufficient accuracy for the simulations. For the lateral motion cases, the same meshing strategy was adopted, and the final mesh size was 5.6 million cells.

2.3. Open-frame ratio selection and integral structural design
The ROV is propelled by six thrusters, with four arranged in an annular configuration to control horizontal motion and two positioned in parallel to manage vertical motion. The open-frame underwater robot structure under investigation is illustrated in Fig. 3. The vehicle adopts a three-layer baffle plate design (upper, middle, and lower), where the upper baffle plate accommodates buoyancy materials and a control compartment, while the lower baffle plate supports storage devices. The structure incorporates perforated sidewalls with ribbed reinforcements.

Fig. 4. Hydrodynamic performance of the ROV under different open-frame ratios.

Under a forward velocity of 0.4 m/s, the lift-to-drag ratio of the robot initially increases and then decreases with increasing 
 within a specific porosity range, as shown in Fig. 4. Considering installation constraints, L1 and L2 were set to 0.1 m and 0.19 m, respectively, yielding an open-frame ratio of 
 = 0.53. The lift-to-drag ratio decreases with higher sidewall porosity; thus, k was determined to be 40 % to balance hydrodynamic performance and structural integrity. The perforation pattern of the sidewalls is depicted in Fig. 4. Key physical parameters of the designed open-frame robot are summarized in Table 3.

3. Experimental validation
To validate the reliability of such open-frame robots and to compare their hydrodynamic performance with the numerical simulation results, this study fabricated a prototype of the open-frame underwater robot according to the designed dimensional parameters. Subsequently, water tank experiments were conducted in a cylindrical tank with an inner diameter of 4.8 m, a height of 1.5 m, and an experimental water depth of 1.1 m to verify the robot's motion performance. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5. During the experiments, motion control of the robot by the upper computer was achieved via a towing cable. The navigation status of the open-frame robot during the experiment is illustrated in Fig. 6.

The experiments serve two distinct purposes: (1) attitude angle measurements were conducted to verify the stability and structural reliability of the open-frame configuration; (2) flow velocity measurements at multiple blockage ratios were carried out to validate the CFD predictions of flow field evolution and secondary vortex behavior.
3.1. Performance validation of underwater robots
To verify the stability of low-speed navigation and the reliability of the simulation results for the open-frame underwater robot, a gyroscopic attitude angle sensor was employed to measure the pitch, roll, and yaw angles during surge motion (forward at 0.4 m/s) and sway motion (lateral translation to the left). In the attitude angle measurement experiments, a gyroscopic attitude angle sensor (model IWT603) was employed, with an inclination accuracy of 0.2° under static conditions and a resolution of 0.0055° when horizontally placed. The measurements were conducted at underwater depths ranging from 0.4 m to 0.6 m. The sensor was mounted with its base flat on the control compartment atop the robot, and the waterproof compartment was securely sealed before data transmission via an umbilical cable to an external data acquisition system. Each experiment was repeated three times to confirm stable attitude angle fluctuations, ensuring reliable results.
Attitude angle variations during surge motion were recorded in Fig. 7(a), while those during sway motion were documented in Fig. 7(b). Experimental data demonstrated stable fluctuations in pitch, roll, and yaw angles under both motion modes, meeting the stability requirements for underwater robots. Specifically, during surge motion, the attitude angles were maintained within −5°–5°, whereas during sway motion they varied within −8°–8°. These results highlight the structural stability of the open-frame design during underwater navigation, thereby providing a solid foundation for the subsequent CFD simulations.

3.2. Flow velocity validation in open-frame structures
To validate the reliability of vorticity variations in CFD simulations and verify the rationality of velocity gradient distributions across different positions in the open-frame structure, velocity measurements were conducted at critical flow regions during surge motion (0.4 m/s forward). For underwater velocity measurements, a Doppler velocity log (DVL) was used, providing a measurement accuracy of ±1 mm/s, a resolution of 1 mm/s, and a measurement range from 0.02 m/s to 6 m/s. Three measurement points (P1, P2, P3) were strategically placed on the outer surface of the sidewall ribs near the open-frame structure, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Measurements were repeated at least three times to ensure statistical reliability, and the average values were taken for analysis. Experimental data collected from these near-wall regions were compared with simulated velocity profiles, with the results presented in Fig. 9. The comparison between experimental measurements and numerical simulations revealed good overall agreement in velocity trends across the three monitoring points.

To investigate the influence of blocking ratio on flow field dynamics, experiments were conducted at blocking ratios (β) of 15 %, 30 %, and 45 %. The velocity measurement points (P4, P5, and P6) were located on the outer surface of the sidewall ribs near the open-frame structure, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The corresponding structural configurations used to achieve different blocking ratios are shown in Fig. 10. Measurements were carried out during leftward sway motion at 0.4 m/s. The comparison between experimental and simulated data is presented in Fig. 11.

The average relative errors for the four groups of experimental and simulated results were calculated, with an overall mean value of 14.03 %. From a hydrodynamic perspective, the discrepancy mainly arises because at higher blockage ratios, vortex stretching and outward migration enhance boundary interactions with the cylindrical tank wall, causing stronger velocity attenuation in experiments than predicted by CFD. In addition, the relatively shallow water depth-to-model size ratio (≈3) intensifies wall-induced turbulence and vortex shedding, which are not fully captured in simulations. Despite these discrepancies, the experimental and simulated results demonstrated consistent overall trends, validating the numerical model's capability to capture key flow field characteristics under varying blocking ratios. Therefore, the experimental validation provides a solid foundation for the subsequent CFD-based hydrodynamic analysis.
4. Results analysis and discussion
Based on a high-fidelity numerical model and mesh strategy, this study systematically investigates the flow mechanisms of the open-frame underwater robot under multiple operational conditions, providing a theoretical foundation for hydrodynamic performance optimization of the ROV.
4.1. Vorticity analysis around the side opening
Disturbances in the underwater external environment significantly impact the stability of underwater robots during all operational phases. For an open-frame underwater robot undergoing linear navigation, the critical motion states include the initial startup phase and the steady operation phase. The initial flow field was assumed to be quiescent. At the velocity inlet, the flow speed increased linearly from 0 m/s with an acceleration of 0.1 m/s2 until reaching a constant speed of 0.4 m/s at t = 4 s (Re = 1.7 × 105). The initial startup phase corresponds to t = 2 s, while the steady operation phase corresponds to t = 4 s, when the velocity had reached 0.4 m/s.
Fig. 12 presents the vorticity distribution contours on the sidewall rib plates during different stages of forward motion, while Fig. 13 illustrates the vorticity distribution on the sidewall surface at the initial startup phase (t = 2 s) and the steady operation phase (t = 4 s), with the specific slice locations indicated in Fig. 17. The vorticity contours reveal marked differences between the two states. Comparative analysis with the Closed-frame structure (k = 0) under the same conditions shows that, regardless of open-frame or closed configurations, the front section of the sidewall consistently exhibits higher vorticity than the rear section during forward motion.

Furthermore, during the initial startup phase, the open-frame structure demonstrates reduced overall vorticity in the near-wall region compared to the closed-frame structure. Quantitative analysis of mean vorticity values (Fig. 14) reveals that the optimized open-frame sidewall reduces average vorticity by 73.2 % during the initial startup phase (t = 2 s) and by 18.2 % during the steady operation phase (t = 4 s) compared to the closed-frame structure. Additionally, at a forward speed of 0.4 m/s, the open-frame robot achieves a 10.62 % improvement in lift-to-drag ratio compared to the closed-frame structure. These results confirm that the open-frame sidewall design effectively reduces near-wall vorticity and enhances hydrodynamic efficiency throughout the operational process.

4.2. Wall pressure and near-wall TKE in open rack
In this study, the open-frame structure of the underwater robot exhibits a bilaterally symmetric configuration. After achieving steady surge motion, we analyzed the surface-averaged vorticity and TKE on one sidewall under varying surge velocities and distances from the wall, as shown in Fig. 15. When the surge velocity was 0.4 m/s, only the region within 0.05 m from the sidewall exhibited vorticity values exceeding 0.1 s−1. Similarly, at velocities lower than 0.4 m/s, the near-wall turbulent kinetic energy values remained below 6.82 × 10−5. In contrast, at velocities exceeding 0.4 m/s, both the magnitude and fluctuation range of near-wall vorticity and TKE increased significantly. This indicates that the open-frame underwater robot generates smaller disturbances during low-speed operations.

To investigate the pressure distribution within the robot's frame between the three-layer baffles, we conducted pressure analysis at the junctions of upper (B1), middle (B2), and lower (B3) baffles with the sidewall. The upper and lower surfaces of each baffle are denoted as T (top) and B (bottom), respectively. The pressure distribution is illustrated in Fig. 16. Notably, the overall pressure and pressure gradient between the upper and middle baffles (B1-B2) are significantly higher than those between the middle and lower baffles (B2-B3). This discrepancy may correlate with the structural proportions of the three-layer baffle system.

4.3. Effect of motion state on flow field
External flow field disturbances around underwater robots significantly influence their motion performance across various stages from startup to stable operation. This study conducted flow field visualization analysis at different time points for both surge and sway motions of the robot. In the motion simulation, the fluid domain inlet was set as a velocity inlet with an initial condition of 0 m/s. The robot underwent uniformly accelerated linear motion at 0.15 m/s2 until reaching 0.8 m/s, after which it transitioned to steady linear motion. To account for the fluid memory effect, the simulation was extended beyond the acceleration period, and data analysis was performed only after the flow field reached a statistically steady state. The stabilization of lift and drag forces was verified before extracting the flow field data, ensuring that transient effects no longer influenced the results. Cross-sectional analyses were performed at z = 0.061 and y = 0.00148 planes for surge motion, and at z = 0.061 and x = −0.0016 planes for sway motion. Global ROV visualizations (Fig. 17) illustrated the specific slice positions and observation directions. Flow field pathline and contour plots (Fig. 18, Fig. 19) were obtained for both motion modes at different time points.

For longitudinal motion, boundary layer development was observed in the flow field as the robot accelerated. At t = 2s, the flow pattern showed initial attachment with low-momentum fluid around the robot and the onset of wake region formation. By t = 4s, the wake region remained compact and stable. At t = 6s, increased velocity induced stronger flow separation, with flow pathlines indicating the emergence of weakly defined vortex structures and intensified velocity fluctuations in the wake core. Beyond t = 8s, turbulent transition occurred with significant momentum diffusion, while the robot's bottom-mounted equipment created distinct vortex structures downstream. Velocity contour plots revealed greater velocity gradients at the leading edge of the sidewalls compared to the trailing edge, consistent with high vorticity regions analyzed in Fig. 13.
During lateral motion, small-scale vortical structures remained limited before t = 4s despite large blockage effects, with stable flow pathlines and short wake lengths showing minimal velocity gradients. At t = 6s, multi-scale vortex shedding developed in the wake near the sidewall baffles, with slightly enlarged vortex dimensions compared to initial motion. By t = 8s, when the robot approached its maximum simulated velocity, the number of vortices decreased while their sizes increased significantly, indicating fully developed turbulence with stretched vortex cores. Compared to surge motion, lateral sway induced a 12.1 % relative increase in wake width at t = 8s, attributed to enhanced flow-resistance interactions.
These findings highlight two critical design considerations: structural simplification helps mitigate vortex-induced vibrations during navigation, and maintaining operational velocities below 0.4 m/s should form the basis of control strategies to minimize hydrodynamic disturbances during precision operations.
To systematically reveal the evolution of hydrodynamic performance for open-frame underwater robots during longitudinal surge and lateral sway motions, this study quantifies the drag characteristics of both motion modes through numerical simulations, as shown in Fig. 20. Results indicate that at relatively low velocities (V ≤ 0.4 m/s, Re ≤ 1.7 × 105), the drag coefficients for both surge and sway motions remain nearly constant and low, demonstrating excellent hydrodynamic efficiency suitable for precision operations. As the velocity increases beyond 0.4 m/s, the drag force exhibits a noticeable nonlinear growth trend: the drag at 0.6 m/s is approximately 1.23 times higher than at 0.4 m/s for surge motion, and 1.25 times higher for sway motion. This increase is closely associated with variations in the Reynolds number, and as the velocity increases, the presence of the open-frame structure may induce local transitions from laminar to turbulent flow. Therefore, although the ultimate operating speed should be determined based on the propulsion capacity and mission environment of the ROV, the present results suggest that maintaining surge velocities within 0.4 m/s can effectively avoid premature transition, minimize hydrodynamic resistance, and ensure stable low-disturbance performance.

4.4. Effect of blockage ratio on flow characteristics
According to (Perry and Chong, 1987; Robinson, 1991), secondary vortices refer to coherent vortical structures that are induced by primary vortices or geometric confinement, typically appearing adjacent to separation regions and playing a significant role in momentum transfer and energy dissipation. To analyze the lateral flow field of open-frame underwater robots, complex vortex-induced oscillations were observed. To investigate this phenomenon, the internal flow field of the open-frame structure was studied under a sway velocity of 0.4 m/s (Re = 1.6 × 105). With the rib geometry fixed, a strategy was employed to influence vortex formation by adjusting the blockage ratio (β).
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 10, rectangular obstacles of varying sizes were used to simulate β of 15 %, 30 %, and 45 % within the open-frame structure, enabling analysis of vortex dimensions and positions. Fig. 21 presents combined contour plots of vorticity distribution and vortex core configurations, with white arrows indicating the migration direction from the primary vortex core to the secondary vortex core. At β = 45 %, the vortex core was significantly stretched, exhibiting diffusion and a tendency to split, while the secondary vortex migrated away from the primary core. This suggests that high blockage disrupts the tight coupling between primary and secondary vortices, intensifying energy dissipation and potentially reducing navigation efficiency. When the obstruction size was reduced (β = 30 % and 15 %), the vortex cores became more compact. At β = 30 %, the secondary vortex shifted forward, whereas at β = 15 %, it moved rearward closer to the wall. Notably, both β = 30 % and 15 % configurations showed concentrated vorticity in the secondary vortex cores with smaller dimensions, indicating stable shear separation points and low energy dissipation. Quantitative analysis in Fig. 22 further reveals trends in lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) and wake length to characteristic length ratio (LR/D) across blockage ratios. At β = 30 %, the lift-to-drag ratio increased by 7 % compared to β = 15 %. Conversely, β = 45 % yielded the lowest lift-to-drag ratio.

Fig. 22. Relationship between blockage ratio and hydrodynamic parameters.

In the velocity analysis, velocity extraction points (P4, P5, and P6) were located downstream of the sidewall ribs along the outer surface, as shown in Fig. 8. The corresponding simulated velocity distributions are presented in Fig. 23. The results indicated that at 15 % and 30 % blocking ratios, the overall velocity trends were similar: higher velocities were observed at P4, while lower velocities occurred at P5 and P6. Notably, the wake region exhibited lower velocities at 30 % blocking ratio compared to 15 %, suggesting reduced vibration and improved propulsion efficiency, which aligns with simulation predictions of optimal lift-to-drag ratio at 30 % blocking ratio. In contrast, at 45 % blocking ratio, velocity distributions at P4, P5, and P6 became more uniform, showing distinct alterations in flow field patterns compared to the lower blocking ratios.

In summary, the sidewall ribs of the open-frame structure exhibit an effect of inducing secondary vortices, which enhances vortex interactions compared to conventional bluff-body flows. The analysis confirms that an intermediate blockage ratio (β = 30 %) achieves the best balance, producing stable secondary vortex structures with reduced energy dissipation and improved lift-to-drag performance. These findings highlight a feasible optimization strategy for improving the hydrodynamic efficiency of open-frame underwater robots.
5. Conclusions and future work
This study developed a hierarchical porosity optimization method to design an open-frame ROV with improved hydrodynamic performance. Unsteady flow field analysis clarified the flow field variations at different navigation time points during surge and sway motions, and revealed that sidewall ribs induce secondary vortices with enhanced stability compared to conventional bluff-body flows. Experimental results further validated the numerical predictions, confirming the reliability of the optimized open-frame design.
Beyond the specific ROV studied, the methodology integrates porosity-based structural optimization with hydrodynamic mechanism analysis, providing a general framework applicable to other open-frame ROVs. This approach offers guidance for balancing compactness, hydrodynamic efficiency, and structural adaptability in future ROV designs.
From an engineering perspective, four practical design guidelines can be summarized:
(1)
In terms of porosity optimization, the analysis indicated that a frame ratio of 0.53 and a sidewall opening ratio of 40 % effectively enhanced hydrodynamic efficiency. Compared with a non-open-frame design, sidewall vorticity was reduced by 18.2 % at a stable forward speed of 0.4 m/s, demonstrating improved flow stability for small- and medium-scale ROVs under typical operational conditions.
(2)
Regarding blockage effects, the results showed that a blockage ratio of approximately 30 % provided the most favorable balance between lift and drag. At this configuration, the wake length was shortened and vortex structures became more compact, supporting both higher propulsion efficiency and improved maneuverability.
(3)
For flow control and practical operations, the incorporation of sidewall ribs promoted the formation of secondary vortices, thereby stabilizing the wake during both surge and sway motions. This structural feature, together with maintaining low navigation speeds (<0.4 m/s), minimized turbulence diffusion and offered significant advantages for precision tasks such as inspection and sampling.
This study provides a validated framework that integrates hierarchical porosity optimization with hydrodynamic mechanism analysis, offering practical design guidelines for improving the efficiency and stability of open-frame underwater robots. Future large-scale and offshore trials are planned to further examine the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach under real-world operating conditions.
