at NASA LaRC and the compression tests of the intermediate panels was performed at a Boeing facility. All panels
were tested under displacement control mode. The failure loads of the small test panels are given in Table 2 and the
failure loads of the intermediate test panels are given in Table 3.

* Adjusted test data based on engineering analysis.
For the small panels tested, based on the data shown in Table 2, the average compression test failure load is 18.16
kips with test values ranging from -2.6% to +1.3% of average. Similarly, the average tension test failure load is 33.8
kips with test values ranging from -2.2% to +1.3% of the average value.
For the intermediate panels tested under compression at Boeing, significant bending was noticed in one of the
panels (2BC-C-4-1) from the beginning of the loading cycle and ultimately failed at 44.2 kips. However panel 2BCC-4-2 showed normal bending behavior, and based on failure strain of this panel, the failure strain of 2BC-C-4-1 was
modified based on engineering analysis [7], which led to adjusting the failure load to 53 kips. Thus the average
adjusted test failure load of the intermediate panel under compressive load is 52.55 kips.
For the intermediate panels tested under tension load at LaRC, the average test failure load is 109.95 kips. In
addition to the large difference of 13.2% between the two failure loads, both the panels exhibited noticeable nonlinear
behavior with an increase in stiffness. Far-field strain gauge data of both the panels are presented in Figure 4, where
the nonlinear increase in stiffness can be observed occurring for Panel-1 in Figure 4a, and Panel-2 in Figure 4b. In
general, for a uniform loading scenario, strain data from gauges 1-6 (far-field) ideally should exhibit linear behavior
until failure, and should have similar strain values. However, the middle gauges (SG-5, 6) located right above the
notch may record a lesser value. The stiffening behavior was noticed in panel-1 (see Figure 4a) with slight increase in
stiffness at approximately 60 kips. Also, slippage of the test panel was noticed during the test at approximately 92 kips 
10
and is reflected in the load versus end displacement curve in the form of load oscillations. Regarding panel-2 (Figure
4b), a strain jump (strain relaxation) was noticed at approximately 60 kips in gauges 1-4, which was approximately
half the final failure load. This behavior could be attributed to a potential slippage between panel and the loading
fixture. In addition to this jump, the middle gauges (SG-5, 6) are reading higher strains than gauges 1-4.

In general, failure mode of all panels was a through thickness self-similar crack, i.e., the crack path of the laminate
load carrying plies is perpendicular to the loading direction; and the crack starts from the notch tips and then propagates
all the way to the edge. Additionally, crack path in laminates is categorized as self-similar when fibers are fractured
in all the plies, or at least in load carrying plies, which in this case are the 0o
 plies; combined with matrix failure in
non-0o
 plies and delamination confined along the crack path between some or all ply interfaces. Photographs of failed
panels with typical results are presented in Figure 6. Note that the outer surface ply that is visible in the photographs
is a 45o
 ply which delaminated from the underlying plies, and which masks the self-similar nature of the underlying
failure mode of the panel.

IV. Progressive Failure Analysis Methodology
a. Damage Models
Progressive failure analysis (PFA) of notched panels was performed with Abaqus Built-in [5] and COmplete
STress Reduction (COSTR) [6] damage models to obtain failure load predictions for use in test planning, and to assess
overall stiffness and structural response. The Abaqus Built-in damage model, which is commercially available is
briefly described here. For a detailed explanation of the model, one can refer to Abaqus theory manual [5]. In general,
the Abaqus damage model adopts Hashin [8] and Hashin-Rotem [9] failure criterion to identify damage initiation. The
stress degradation approach used to simulation damage is shown in figure 7.
Figure 7: Stress Degradation Profile of Abaqus Built-in Damage Model. 
12
The damage variable evolves based on the stress displacement behavior as shown in Figure 7 for all damage modes
(fiber and matrix). Point A in Figure 7 represents the material strength and damage initiation point. The area of the
triangle is related to energy required to fail the material completely, which is equivalent to the fracture toughness
parameter (Gc) provided by the user. The stress degradation profile after damage initiation, point A, follows the linear
curve AC. Line OB shows the loss in stiffness due to damage initiation and the unloading path due to load removal
that might occur before complete damage.
As an alternative to the Abaqus Built-in damage model, the COSTR damage model was developed at NASA
Langley Research Center to simulate intra-laminar damage such as fiber and matrix failure [6]. The COSTR damage
model is interfaced with the Abaqus/Explict solver utilizing an Abaqus user-written subroutine, VUMAT.
The progressive failure analysis procedure adopted in the COSTR damage model consists of three steps. The first
step is to determine damage in an element at each and every ply. This was accomplished by adopting the HashinRotem failure criteria [9]:
The damage indices df and dm represent the damage status of fiber and matrix material systems, respectively.
Damage index df will be zero while the fiber damage criteria is less than 1, and then attains a value of 1 when the
fiber damage criteria becomes greater or equal to 1. A similar procedure is adopted for the matrix damage index dm.
The constitutive law along with damage indices is presented below.

Once stress in an element for a ply reaches the ply strength, the stress is degraded as show in Figure 8. Damage
simulation of the fiber is accomplished by instantaneously reducing the axial stress, (σ11), to 20% of the axial strength,
X, and then maintaining that level until the area under the stress strain curve when multiplied by the characteristic
length of an element, equates to the fiber fracture toughness (GFc). However, when the transverse stress, (σ22), reaches
the transverse strength, Y, the transverse stress, (σ22), is instantaneously reduced to zero, but the shear stress, (σ12), is
reduced by an amount proportional to the resin volume fraction in plies where the fibers are not aligned with the
loading direction, and to zero level in plies where the fibers are aligned parallel to the loading direction. In the case of
matrix damage, when the shear stress, (σ12), reaches the shear strength, S, then both transverse stress, (σ22), and shear
stress, (σ12), are instantaneously reduced to zero. Additional information regarding shear stress degradation due to
matrix damage can be found in reference [10]. The failure load provided by this damage model is independent of
finite element area [6].
13
Figure 8: Stress Degradation Profiles in COSTR Damage Model.
The final step in PFA is simulation of the virtual crack. This step is accomplished by deleting elements from
computation when fibers in all the plies have been damaged. In certain plies, where fibers are not damaged but matrix
is, a quadratic strain criterion involving transverse and shear strains is adopted and is set to a large value greater than
0.2 in./in., in flagging failure of the ply.
In general, both damage models have the same in-plane failure criteria. However, the stress degradation profile is
significantly different between the two damage methods. The Abaqus built-in damage model has a gradual stress
degradation profile after damage (fiber and matrix) initiation. Also, Abaqus built-in uses one fiber fracture toughness
value, which does not accommodate the use of both fiber fracture initiation and propagation values, when available.
However, the COSTR damage model is capable of using both fiber fracture, initiation and propagation values and has
different stress degradation profiles for fiber and matrix damage simulation.
b. Progressive Failure Analysis Model of Small and Intermediate Panels
Finite element models (FEM) of the small and intermediate panels were generated for performing both
compression and tension analysis using the Abaqus explicit finite element code. The general panel specifications for
the small and intermediate panels are listed in Table 1. The COSTR finite element models are presented in Figure 9
for small and intermediate panels for both the tension and compression analysis. The panel’s left edge is fixed in all
degrees of freedom (DOF) and the right edge is fixed for all DOF except for the axial DOF. An axial displacement is
applied to the right edge of the panels. For the compression panels, all the interior nodes except a small window near
the notch area are fixed in the out-of-plane direction (highlighted in orange color). In the case of the intermediate
tension panel, a few nodes near the notch are fixed in the out-of-plane direction to represent the out-of-plane constraint
imposed by the rod shown in Figure 3b, which was designed to prevent buckling near the notch during testing. The
notch width is 0.25 in. in all models and the notch tips all have a radius of 0.125 in. at the ends. The material properties
and strengths used in the pre-test PFA are given in Table 4 [2]. Average modulus values in 1, 2 direction and average
value of Poisson’s ratio were used in the analysis by both damage models. Identical properties and strengths are used
by both the damage models except fiber and matrix fracture toughness values. Fiber and matrix fracture toughness
properties in tension and compression used in the Abaqus built-in damage model is half of what is used for the COSTR
damage model and this approach was based on past experience and best modeling practices when using Abaqus. The
fracture initiation values used in the COSTR damage model are evaluated based on Bazant’s equation provided in the
Abaqus manual [5] for a characteristic distance of 0.09-in. The FEM of the panels were generated using S4R Abaqus
shell elements. The maximum element length is approximately 0.125 in. The FEM used with the Abaqus built-in
damage model has the same global dimensions, boundary and load conditions as shown in Figure 9, but different
element sizes are used. The Abaqus Built-in FEM consists of elements whose maximum length is approximately
0.08in. Evaluation of maximum element size is based on Bazant’s equation provided in the Abaqus manual [5] and
depends on fracture toughness properties. Since the damage evolution and mesh regularization procedures are
different between the Abaqus built-in and COSTR damage models, the latter can accommodate larger element sizes.

V. Results and Discussion
a. Comparison of Test Results to Pre-Test PFA
The pre-test analysis results are presented in Table 5 along with test data. Based on comparison of analysis and
test results, the PFA results mostly over-predicted the failure load for compression load cases and under-predicted the
failure load for tension load cases. This trend was consistent for small panels with both damage models, while there
was a slight under-prediction by COSTR for the intermediate panel tested in compression. Considering the
compression results, correlation between test and PFA analysis is considered to be adequate with the maximum
difference of 11.3% occurring for the small panels when compared to COSTR PFA results. Considering the tension
results, the maximum difference was near 40%, and both damage models significantly under-predicted the test failure
load. Consequently, the pre-test PFA analysis models are not considered adequate to accurately predict the failure load
of the notched composite laminates when tested in tension. Additionally, all analysis performed predicted a selfsimilar type failure mode originating at the notch tip, which agreed with the test results.

b. Post-Test PFA and Material Property Adjustments
Due to the large differences observed in some cases between the pre-test PFA predicted and test results, further
investigation into the possible causes ensued by interrogating the material properties chosen for the pre-test analysis.
The purpose of this effort was to identify a material property input set that better represented the actual panel material
properties, and that should subsequently be used in future analyses to better predict panel behavior. Considering the
fiber direction strength data in tension (Xt = 337 ksi) as reported in Table 4, the value was observed to be low when
compared with other material data sources from Hexcel [11] and NIAR [12], where the data sheets are presented in
the appendix. Hexcel and NIAR reported tensile strength of unidirectional lamina as 395 ksi and 371.08 ksi,
respectively, at room temperature. However, NIAR [12] reported an Xt of 320.79 ksi for an un-notched tension
laminate (UNT0) which is close to the value (337.0 ksi) used in pre-test analysis. The UNT0 coupons are 0/90 laminate
and the strengths are back calculated from Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) expressions. So, the Xt = 371 ksi value
obtained from NIAR of the unidirectional lamina was used in the post-test PFA rather than a value of 337.0 ksi which
was used in the pre-test analysis. Next, the fiber-direction compression strength, Xc = 248.94 ksi, used in the pre-test
analysis was also obtained from 0/90 cross-ply laminate coupons. However, unlike for Xt, there was no data available
for Xc from unidirectional laminates in the material property reference documents used here. Hence, considering the
pre-test PFA over-predicting the test panel failure load as presented in Table 4, Xc was reduced to 215.0 ksi for the
post-test PFA prediction. This value was chosen based on several PFA predictions performed using COSTR damage
model to determine a value that resulted in a failure load that better matched the small compression test data. Then
post-test PFA analysis was performed just with COSTR damage model. The fiber fracture toughness values reported
in reference [2] are used in the post-test analysis for GcfT and GcfC. However the fracture toughness values of GcmT
and GcmC were evaluated using Bazant’s [13] energy equation for a characteristic distance of 0.09-in. The modified
strengths and properties used in post -test PFA are given in Table 6. Measured values are used when normalized
values are not available for some properties and strengths. The highlighted cell indicates values that are changed from
the pre-test data set where for this set the properties and strengths are now taken from Reference [12] unless already
discussed otherwise. However the same finite element models used in the pre-test analysis were used during the posttest analysis when employing Abaqus built-in and COSTR damage models.

The failure loads from the post-test PFA using the COSTR and Abaqus built-in damage models are presented in
Table 7 and 8 for small and intermediate panels, respectively. Considering the small panels, the failure load prediction
by COSTR damage model was within 1% and 12% for compression and tension cases, respectively. Since the COSTR
model of the small panel was tuned to predict compression failure load for the small panel by adjusting Xc for the
post-test analyses, the close prediction for the small panel tested in compression was expected. For the intermediate
panels, the failure load was under-predicted for the compression load case by approximately 8% when compared to
average test data and the failure load was under-predicted for the tension load case by approximately 23% when
compared to average test data.
Similar trend was noticed in the failure load predictions by Abaqus built-in damage model. In case of small panels,
the failure load over prediction was within 2% and under prediction of 16% for compression and tension cases,
respectively. For the intermediate panels, the failure load was under-predicted for the compression load case by
approximately 12% when compared to average test data and the failure load was under-predicted for the tension load
case by approximately 26.3% when compared to average test data.
In general, failure load predictions are improved using the post-test material property data set. Consequently, this
data set is recommended for future analyses of panels constructed from the same laminate material with COSTR
damage model. Considering just the post-test results, failure load prediction is better with respect to compression load
cases than tension load cases. For the tension load tests, under-prediction of the failure load is considered to be due
to the limitation of the finite element models. During testing of the small and intermediate panels in tension, the
delamination occurring at certain ply interfaces, as was shown in Figure 6, would have caused the stress reduction at
the notch tips and have extend the failure load. To improve the prediction of failure load of tension panels, higher
fidelity models, using solid elements with cohesive elements at certain ply interfaces, are recommended for future
studies to better predict failure.

The crack path predicted by the COSTR model with post-test properties is presented in Figure 10. The model
predicts self-similar crack for all cases evaluated which agreed with the test results. However, simulation of
delamination is not possible with shell models as this failure mode is not available. Consequently, as noted earlier,
this could be the reason for the discrepancies between PFA predicted and test failure load of both small and
intermediate tension panels. The evidence of delamination is prominent in small tension panel which is shown in
Figure 4, where the damage region is widely spread.
The crack path predicted by the Abaqus built-in damage model with post-test properties is identical to the one
presented in Figure 10 and hence, is not presented in this report. However, the model predicts self-similar crack in all
coupons and for all load cases evaluated which agreed with the test results.

Figure 10: Crack Path (Fiber Damage) Predictions by COSTR Damage model
In Figure 11, the load versus end displacement response obtained from a typical test of a small panel is compared
to post-test PFA results using the COSTR damage model. For the compression load case, PFA results yield stiffer
responses than the test panel by approximately 11%. The test data in Figure 11a is from the 2BC-C-1-1 panel. The
main reason for this could be the out-of-plane constraint applied to the nodes in the finite element models, which
significantly reduces the flexibility to a greater extent than in the experiment. Also, the models do not account for any
geometric imperfection of the test panel, or non-uniform load application, which would also contribute to a stiffer
response with the model. For the tension load case, the stiffness of COSTR finite element model and the test panel
match very well. The test data in Figure 11b is of a 2BC-T-1-2 panel. The failure load obtained from COSTR damage
model is lower likely because of not capturing the delamination damage mode. In general, when same direction plies
are stacked together, the interface is prone to generate large inter-laminar shear stresses which causes delamination at
the interface. The delamination will reduce the stress concentration and slow down the failure process. This is evident
in the small failed tension panel pictures shown in Figure 4, in the form of wider damage zone consisting of fiber pull
out, fiber breakage, and delaminations.

In Figure 12, the load versus end displacement response from an intermediate panel tested in compression and

in the stiffness with COSTR damage model and test panel for compression load case. The test data presented in Figure
12a for the compression load case is from panel 2BC-C-4-2. In the case of tension load, the stiffness from COSTR
damage model matches well with the test panel. The test data presented in Figure 12b is of the panel 2BC-T-4-1.
