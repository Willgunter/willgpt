Abstract
Efficient cooling of electronic devices is critical for ensuring stable performance, extending service life, and enhancing reliability. This capability is essential for advancing high-power-density and integration technologies, mitigating thermal failure risks, and improving energy efficiency. However, existing miniaturized ionic wind radiators face limitations in both research depth and spatial coupling between corona wind modes and heat load distributions. To address these challenges, this study integrates corona discharge with a heat sink, proposing a novel coreless monolithic corona wind heat sink (CM-CWHS) for electronic cooling. An unsteady electric field-flow coupling model is developed to characterize complex inter-fin flow dynamics. Key parameters-including operating voltage, discharge distance, emitter longitudinal height, collector width, and fixing plate position-are analyzed via a response surface model. Through multiple regression, a predictive model for the flow enhancement coefficient is established, quantifying the relationship between structural parameters and cooling performance. A four-factor, three-level Box-Behnken experimental design reveals the relative contributions of each parameter to flow enhancement. A composite main-auxiliary fin structure (30° main fin angle, 15-mm auxiliary fin length) is proposed, achieving a flow enhancement coefficient of 247.25 × 10−6 m3/J and a Nusselt number of 46.44-representing improvements of 37.2 % and 46.6 %, respectively, over the baseline design. Flow distribution analysis demonstrates that optimized wall pressure gradients reduce ineffective ionization regions, resulting in a centrosymmetric divergent corona wind pattern between main fins, with maximum velocity gradients aligned spatially with heat source locations. Compared to conventional aluminum substrate heat sinks, the optimized CM-CWHS reduces temperature by 17.9 °C under a 15.5-W heat load, improves cooling capacity by 19.51 %, and achieves a convective heat transfer coefficient of 43 W/(m2·K) (a 16.1 % increase). This work offers a viable solution to the conflict between electronic miniaturization and high heat flux density.

1. Introduction
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been widely used in the lighting industry due to their low energy consumption and long lifespan. However, the heat dissipation performance of the packaging structure has become a critical factor limiting the development of high-power LED chips. In common electronic devices, passive cooling solutions such as mechanical fans, heat pipes, or heat sinks are often used for thermal management. Nevertheless, with the exponential increase in integrated circuit density, the local heat flux density has risen rapidly, making it difficult for traditional heat dissipation technologies to meet the increasingly stringent cooling requirements. This insufficient cooling capacity may lead to equipment failures and even pose safety hazards. Traditional aluminum heat sinks show rapidly diminishing returns when heat flux exceeds 50 W/cm2, creating an urgent need for alternative active cooling methods that combine space efficiency with enhanced thermal performance.
Corona wind cooling technology is an innovative heat dissipation solution based on the principles of corona discharge and electro-hydrodynamics (EHD) [1]. When a high voltage is applied between an emitting electrode with a small radius of curvature and a collecting electrode with a large radius of curvature, the air near the emitter is ionized into positive and negative ions. These charged particles collide with neutral gas molecules under the action of the Coulomb force and exchange momentum, resulting in a macroscopic gas flow phenomenon from the emitter to the collector, known as the corona wind [2]. Compared with traditional cooling methods, corona wind technology offers significant advantages. Its bladeless design not only reduces the risk of mechanical wear but also decreases the likelihood of equipment failure caused by dust accumulation, thereby enhancing the service life and operational reliability. More importantly, this technology also shows unique potential in microchannel heat dissipation scenarios where traditional axial fans are ineffective [3]. Therefore, corona wind cooling technology has broad application prospects in the thermal management of high heat flux electronic devices, especially in applications such as automotive LED headlamps and power batteries that require high cooling performance [4].
Based on the unique flow characteristics of corona wind, its main applications in the field of thermal management can be summarized into two technical approaches. Firstly, the corona wind generator can be used as an active driving device to directly drive the airflow for forced cooling of the target heat source. Secondly, the corona wind generator can be combined with other devices to regulate the motion state of the boundary layer at the microscale, thereby significantly improving the cooling efficiency of local areas. From the perspective of structural design, corona wind generators exhibit diverse characteristics, mainly including the following typical forms [[5], [6], [7]]. The first is the single-emitter structure, which has the advantage of simple construction. The second is the multi-emitter structure, which effectively enhances the output capacity of the corona wind by increasing the number of emitters. The third is the optimized structure with auxiliary electrodes, which improves the electric field distribution by introducing auxiliary electrodes in addition to the main electrodes. The fourth is the innovative structure modified with nanomaterials, which significantly improves the surface properties of the materials through nanoscale treatment of the emitter and collector surfaces. These innovative structural designs provide a wide range of options for the optimization of corona wind technology in different application scenarios.
In recent years, a series of significant advancements has been made in the research of corona wind technology for cooling electronic devices. Li et al. [8] employed copper foam as the collector in the study of corona wind generators. Through experimental comparative analysis, they investigated the discharge characteristics and cooling performance of different structures. The results indicated that the 'needle-copper foam' structure exhibits a wider operating voltage range and higher self-sustaining discharge voltage characteristics. Further experiments demonstrated that the optimized structure can effectively reduce the case temperature of high-power LED chips (by up to 2.3 °C) and significantly enhance their luminous performance. Regarding structural optimization, Chung et al. [9] improved the traditional 'needle-mesh' corona wind generator by adding a circular hole in the center of the collector. Experimental studies showed that this centrally perforated structural design makes the fluid momentum and maximum velocity more concentrated, which is particularly suitable for local cooling scenarios and shows better cooling effects. Concerning the influence of emitter structure parameters, Qu et al. [10] systematically studied the mechanism of factors such as the material, number, and spacing of needle electrodes in the 'needle-ring' corona wind generator on its output performance. Simulations revealed that for a three-needle emitter layout, the optimal electrode spacing is 16 mm, while for a four-needle layout, it is 11 mm. Experiment results indicated that the optimized corona wind generator can stably control the surface temperature of the heating film below 55 °C. Shin et al. [11] proposed a novel bent-wire emitter structure for cooling high-power LED chips with the generated airflow. Experimental results showed that when the input voltage is 7.5 kV and the curvature radius of the wire electrode is 110 μm, the system achieves the best output performance. Only 0.6 W of power consumption is required to improve the cooling performance of the heat sink by 148 %. Zeng et al. [12] conducted in-depth research on the influence of environmental factors on the performance of corona wind pumps. The study showed that an increase in temperature and water vapor condensation can increase the corona current, thereby increasing the corona wind speed and reducing the breakdown voltage. However, an increase in humidity has the opposite effect, characterized by a weakened corona current, a decreased corona wind speed, and an increased breakdown voltage. In terms of material modification, Wang et al. [13] prepared graphene-coated electrodes using the dip-coating method and studied their influence on the cooling performance of the corona wind system. Experimental results indicated that the excellent aspect ratio and field-emission characteristics of graphene can effectively reduce the inception voltage and increase the corona wind speed. Notably, the two-stage corona discharge phenomenon formed after coating the emitter with graphene helps increase the current density, further enhancing the corona wind speed. The above studies indicate that through multi-faceted research and exploration, such as structural optimization, material innovation, and parameter regulation, corona wind technology shows broad application prospects in the field of electronic device heat dissipation.
Current research on ionic wind cooling faces several fundamental limitations: (1) Most studies rely on single-factor experimental methods, failing to account for parameter interactions [14,15]; (2) Existing designs typically incorporate central support structures that disrupt airflow distribution; and (3) The spatial coupling between corona wind modes and heat load distributions remains inadequately addressed. These shortcomings result in suboptimal performance when applied to real-world electronic cooling systems with asymmetric heat loads. To overcome these challenges, this study pioneers a chipless monolithic corona wind heat sink (CM-CWHS) architecture through the integration of corona discharge and radiator topology optimization. The proposed binary gradient fin system (featuring a main-auxiliary cooperative topology) significantly enhances both the flow enhancement coefficient and heat transfer performance while achieving spatial adaptation between corona airflow patterns and heat distribution profiles. A three-dimensional unsteady fully coupled numerical model of electric and flow fields is developed to analyze the evolution of corona wind under multiphysics synergy. Building on prior work by C. Balaji et al. [16], which established correlations between bubble departure diameter (BDD), bubble departure frequency (BDF), heat transfer coefficients, and Nusselt numbers via system control parameters, this study introduces the flow enhancement index as an innovative indirect metric to quantify structural interaction effects. Response surface modeling is employed to establish explicit mappings between structural parameters and the flow enhancement index, forming a quantitative predictive framework for cooling performance [17,18]. The Box-Behnken experimental design method is utilized to construct a parameter sampling matrix, with variance decomposition revealing the contribution spectrum of geometric parameters to flow enhancement. Surrogate model-based sensitivity analysis further quantifies how structural interactions influence heat transfer efficiency. Post optimization, the CM-CWHS demonstrates a markedly improved heat transfer coefficient and reduced heat source temperatures compared to conventional designs, proving viable for engineering applications such as automotive LED headlamp cooling and high-power chip thermal management.
2. Structural design of the coreless corona wind heat sink and experimental system
2.1. Design of the monolithic corona wind heat sink
This study devises an integrated coreless corona wind heat sink structure (as shown in Fig. 1). The structure is centered around a sunflower-shaped heat sink, with five alumina (Al2O3) insulating adjustment rods and two radially perforated fixing plates made of polycarbonate (PC) serving as the supporting structure. Specifically, a tungsten wire with a diameter of 0.1 mm is evenly wound around a red copper cylinder with a thickness of 0.5 mm to form the emitter structure. This copper cylinder is fixed on the outside of a PC hollow cylinder with an inner diameter of 5 mm and a height of 40 mm, which serves as the ground electrode. The hollow cylinder is fixed at the center of an aluminum alloy substrate. The key innovative features of this structure are as follows: The design of the radially perforated fixing plates allows for optimizing the discharge spacing by adjusting their positions. The central support rod, with a diameter of 5 mm, provides stable mechanical support for the entire device. Meanwhile, the non-metallic material of the support rod significantly reduces the mass of the heat sink. The heat source is placed in the central area at the bottom of the substrate, and the generated heat is transferred outward through the fins. Notably, the corona wind produced by corona discharge creates local airflow disturbances between the fins. This disturbance effect remarkably enhances the heat exchange efficiency between the fins and the surrounding environment. Fig. 2 shows the dimensions of the main components of the system and a physical image of the heat sink. Table 1 lists the initial dimensional parameters of each key element in the parametric design. Through the rational configuration of the spatial layout and material properties of each component, this design achieves an efficient thermal management function.

2.2. Layout of the experimental system
An experimental system (as shown in Fig. 3) to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics was designed and constructed. The system primarily consists of three parts: the CW-CWHS and heat source, the power supply system, and the wind speed and temperature testing devices. Regarding the power supply system, a high-voltage DC power supply (Model TC-4080, provided by Dalian Tessmann Technology Co., Ltd.) was employed. It has an output voltage range of 0 to ±20 kV, with a resolution of 0.001 kV and 0.001 mA, and a measurement accuracy of ±0.1 %. This power supply is connected to the emitter to provide a stable high-voltage electric field. An oscilloscope is also equipped to monitor the actual power supply voltage fluctuations in real time, ensuring the stability of the corona discharge process. The corona current value is precisely measured by a picoammeter connected to the ground electrode. In the testing system, a Testo405-V1 hot-wire anemometer (manufactured by Testo AG, Germany) with a measurement range of 0–10 m/s and a resolution of 0.01 m/s is used to measure the corona wind velocity at specific positions. For temperature measurement, several K-type thermocouples (with an accuracy of ±0.5 °C) are combined with a multi-channel temperature detector (produced by Beijing Smartrace Technology Co., Ltd., with a resolution of 0.1 °C). Temperature is synchronously collected at the heating plate, the upper surface of the substrate, and the fins (as shown in Fig. 3(a)). In the experiment, an infrared thermal imager (Model H11 pro+, provided by HIKVISION) was additionally employed to visualize the temperature distribution. All temperature data are transmitted in real-time through a data acquisition card and stored in a computer. To ensure the controllability of experimental conditions, the entire CW-CWHS assembly is placed in a thermostat during the experiment for isolated testing. This effectively reduces the influence of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and airflow on its performance.

2.3. Uncertainty analysis of the measured parameters
Within the theoretical framework of experimental uncertainty analysis established by Moffat [19], experimental errors are categorized into direct measuring uncertainties and propagation uncertainties. This section primarily addresses the direct measuring uncertainty component, specifically the uncertainty associated with quantifying the mean corona wind velocity via hot-wire anemometry (as formulated in Eq. (1)) and the uncertainty in thermocouple-based heat source temperature measurement (as detailed in Eq. (2)). Propagation uncertainty, conversely, is governed by the foundational uncertainty equation (Eq. (3)). The computational methodologies and resultant values for these uncertainties will be systematically elaborated in conjunction with the target solution equation in subsequent analyses.

The uncertainty components contributing to temperature measurement were quantified as follows: ‘
’ denotes the K-type thermocouple measurement uncertainty (±0.5 K), ‘
’ represents the multi-channel temperature scanner measurement uncertainty (±0.5 K), and ‘
’ accounts for experimental random error (±0.07 K). As expressed in Eq. (3), each term corresponds to the error propagation coefficient of individual variable uncertainty ‘
’ to the resultant parameter uncertainty ‘
’. Subsequent uncertainty analysis yielded maximum combined uncertainties of ±0.23 K for temperature measurements and ±0.34 m/s for corona wind velocity determinations. Following this error propagation methodology, the instrumentation power consumption uncertainty was subsequently derived through application of Eq. (4) [20].

In the constant-voltage DC power supply system for the corona wind generator, the display resolution uncertainties for voltage ‘
’ and current ‘
’ are quantified as 0.001 kV and 0.001 mA, respectively. The resulting power consumption uncertainty ‘
’, calculated through error propagation analysis, demonstrates a maximum value of 0.022 W under operational conditions.
3. Numerical calculation method and process
This work focuses on the parametric optimization and flow-thermal characterization of a CW-CWHS. Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0, a state-of-the-art multiphysics simulation platform, within a three-dimensional computational framework. The model geometry, as depicted in Fig. 4, was strategically simplified to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining simulation accuracy. Specifically, non-critical components such as the top fixing plate and adjustment rods were omitted, retaining only the fin array and the inter-fin flow regions as the primary computational domain. This simplification approach enables a concentrated investigation into the fundamental flow dynamics of corona wind within the fin channels. To streamline the analysis, circumferential airflow effects were neglected, with the study emphasizing the radial flow characteristics along the heat sink substrate. The model employs open boundary conditions and incorporates a structured coordinate system for efficient mesh generation and solution convergence. Its key advantage lies in the comprehensive visualization of corona wind distribution patterns and the systematic evaluation of structural parameter impacts on electric field intensity and radial airflow velocity. A parametric study was performed by systematically varying the discharge voltage (U) and critical geometric parameters, including discharge spacing (L), emitter's longitudinal height (H), collector width (W), and fixing plate height (T). This approach facilitates the identification of individual parameter effects and their synergistic interactions on the system's flow characteristics and thermal performance. The simulation methodology ensures a robust analysis of the heat sink's operational behavior while maintaining computational tractability through strategic model simplification. This research framework provides valuable insights into the optimization of CW-CWHS design, offering a systematic approach to balance thermal performance and structural efficiency.

3.1. Calculation assumptions
In the calculation process, rational assumptions and simplifications were implemented for non-essential elements to enhance computational efficiency and focus on the core research objectives. The inherent complexity of corona discharge, characterized by intricate multi-physics interactions and multifaceted chemical reaction mechanisms, presents significant challenges for precise numerical modeling. However, given that the primary focus of this study is to investigate the flow and heat transfer phenomena induced by corona discharge rather than to explore its underlying physical mechanisms, appropriate simplifications were applied to secondary factors. The following fundamental assumptions were established to streamline the analysis: (1) The ambient temperature was fixed at 25 °C, with a constant relative humidity of 20 %. Other fluid properties, such as density and viscosity, were assumed to remain invariant throughout the simulation. (2) The ionization process was localized to the emitter surface, considering the extremely limited spatial extent of the ionization zone. The spatial charge density distribution was simplified to a constant value at the electrode surface. (3) The influence of air convection on charged particle motion was deemed negligible compared to ion diffusion. Consequently, convective effects were excluded from the current density calculations. (4) Given the minimal impact of magnetic fields on flow behavior during corona discharge, only the electrostatic field, charge transport field, and the k-ε turbulence model were coupled for comprehensive flow analysis. (5) Ion mobility was assumed to be constant, and complex chemical reactions were disregarded to simplify the computational model. (6) The study was confined to a single-phase, incompressible fluid with a constant dielectric constant and gradient. The electric force acting on the fluid was limited to the Coulomb force.
These assumptions not only provided a robust theoretical foundation for the numerical simulations but also established a coherent framework for accurately analyzing the flow and heat transfer characteristics induced by corona discharge. By focusing on the dominant physical phenomena and eliminating extraneous complexities, this approach ensured computational tractability while maintaining the scientific rigor necessary to achieve the study's objectives.
3.2. Governing equations and boundary conditions
In this study, the critical physical quantities to be determined include the electric potential distribution, space charge density, electric field intensity, and corona wind velocity. To achieve this objective, a multiphysics coupling model integrating electrostatic, charge transport, and flow fields was developed for numerical simulation. This multiphysics coupling approach enables a comprehensive characterization of the complex interaction mechanisms within the system. The governing equations involved are as follows [21]:
The Poisson equation, which establishes the relationship between spatial charge density and electric potential, is formulated as:
(5)
Where ‘
’ is the space charge density (C/m3), ‘
’ is the permittivity of vacuum (
), ‘
’ is the electric potential.
The relationship between electric field intensity and electric potential is as follows:
(6)
The governing equation current density is:
(7)
Where ‘
’ is the current density, ‘
’ is the fluid flow velocity, ‘
’ is the mobility of charged particles in an electric field (
), ‘
’ is the diffusion coefficient of charged particles. The diffusion effect is very weak and negligible compared to the electric field effect [22].
The spatial charge density and current density satisfy the charge conservation equation:
(8)
The corona wind flow satisfies the continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation:
(9)
(10)
Where ‘
’ is the air density, ‘
’ is the static pressure, ‘
’ is the dynamic viscosity of air, 
, ‘
’ is the body force that drives the corona wind.
The body force can be obtained by the following equation:
(11)
In Eq. (11), the second term on the right side represents the dielectrophoretic force, which becomes significant under non-single-phase flow conditions. Given that this study adopts the assumption of single-phase flow, the influence of the dielectrophoretic force is negligible and can be reasonably disregarded in calculations. The third term denotes the electrostrictive force, whose effect is relatively limited in incompressible fluid systems [23]. This is primarily because the incompressibility significantly restricts the volumetric deformation of the fluid, thereby reducing the actual contribution of this force. Consequently, it is treated as a secondary factor and simplified in the model construction process.
Based on the governing equations, the spatial charge density emerges as a critical dependent variable for solving both the electric and flow fields. In this study, the Kaptzov assumption is employed to calculate the spatial charge density. This assumption posits that as the emitter's surface voltage gradually increases, the spatial charge density exhibits an ascending trend. When the applied voltage surpasses the corona discharge inception voltage, the electric field intensity at the emitter's surface stabilizes at a constant value, referred to as the threshold electric field intensity ‘
’. The specific value of ‘
’ can be determined using Peek's empirical formula [24].
(12)
Where ‘
’ is the emitter's radius (cm), ‘
’ is the relative density of the fluid, and it is calculated as:
(13)
Where ‘
’ is the standard temperature, 
, ‘
’ is the standard pressure, 
, ‘
’ and ‘
’ are the actual temperature and pressure, respectively.
The spatial charge density is computed using an iterative method. Initially, an empirical assumption is made regarding the initial spatial charge density, which serves as the starting parameter. Subsequently, the electric field intensity under the corresponding conditions is determined by solving the governing equations. Based on this, the critical threshold electric field intensity ‘
’ is calculated using Peek's empirical formula. The results are then compared and analyzed. If the deviation exceeds the predefined error tolerance, the initial spatial charge density is incrementally adjusted, and the aforementioned computational process is iteratively repeated. The iteration ceases when the results fall within the preset convergence range of error. At this point, the assumed spatial charge density is deemed to represent the actual spatial charge density under the given discharge voltage [25]. The complete computational procedure can be referenced in the framework diagram illustrated in Fig. 5.

To accurately determine the physical properties of the electrostatic field, charge transport field, and flow field, it is imperative to define precise boundary conditions for each respective field. In the simulation of the electrostatic field, the boundary conditions are specified as follows: a high voltage potential ‘
’ is applied to the emitter, while the collector is grounded to maintain a zero potential. At the solid walls, the potential gradient is set to zero, and no-slip conditions are enforced. The remaining domain boundaries are maintained in a zero-charge state. For the charge transport field, the emitter surface is assigned a specific space charge density ‘
’, and the collector surface is configured to have no charge accumulation. All other boundaries are set to have zero charge diffusion flux. In the flow field computation, the Coulomb force is introduced as the primary driving force for the fluid, and no-slip conditions are applied to all solid walls. The outer boundaries of the flow domain are designated as open boundary conditions to facilitate the determination of the corona wind flow field distribution. The specific parameter configurations for these boundary conditions are detailed in Table 2.

3.3. Solver settings and mesh independence test
This study employed COMSOL Multiphysics software for numerical simulations, establishing both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) geometric models to address distinct research objectives. The 2D model was primarily utilized for single-factor experimental analysis and the investigation of spatial charge density distribution characteristics, while the 3D model focused on flow behavior analysis and structural optimization design. The numerical simulation of ionic wind flow is implemented through a coupled computational framework integrating three key modules: the steady-state drift-diffusion equation, electrostatic field, and laminar flow models. The solution procedure follows a systematic three-stage approach: (1) solving the electrostatic field equation (Eq. (6)) and charge transport equation (Eq. (8)) to obtain electric field distribution and space charge density; (2) establishing ionic wind velocity-space charge density correlations through charge transport solutions; and (3) computing spatial volume force distributions by substituting velocity fields into the momentum equation (Eq. (10)). For numerical discretization, second-order finite elements handle potential terms, P1+P1 schemes resolve turbulence terms, while linear shape functions address velocity/pressure fields and convection-diffusion terms. To accommodate rapid space charge transport dynamics, adaptive time stepping is employed: 0.02 ms for initial transients, transitioning to 1 s at steady-state. The transient solver (MUMPS) employs Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF orders 1–2) with Jacobian matrix updates per iteration (0.05 relative tolerance), while physics-scaled residuals govern convergence criteria, ensuring both numerical stability and physical fidelity throughout the finite element analysis.
For mesh generation, six different configurations of mesh element quantities were applied to both models: for the 2D model, the element counts were 15,161, 18,928, 26,752, 52,966, 95,646, and 151,869; for the 3D model, the counts were 258,781, 331,658, 562,146, 925,684, 1,555,649, and 2,254,812 (see Fig. 6). To enhance computational accuracy, a local mesh refinement strategy was implemented near the emitter and collector, with a boundary layer mesh of five layers and a stretching factor of 1.2. The remaining regions were discretized using a five-level partitioning method ranging from regular to extremely fine meshes. During the mesh independence verification process, the maximum corona wind velocity was adopted as the evaluation metric for systematic analysis. By comparing computational results across various mesh densities (as illustrated in Fig. 7), it was observed that the maximum corona wind velocity stabilized when the 2D model employed 26,752 mesh elements and the 3D model utilized 562,146 mesh elements. Further mesh refinement calculations revealed that while additional mesh densification reduced computational errors by 3.9 %, this improvement was accompanied by a significant increase in computational resource costs, which is detrimental to practical computational efficiency. Consequently, after balancing computational accuracy and efficiency, the third mesh configuration (26,752 elements for the 2D model and 562,146 elements for the 3D model) was selected for subsequent research. This mesh generation strategy not only ensured the accuracy of the computational results but also optimized the utilization of computational resources, demonstrating excellent applicability in engineering practice.

3.4. Model validation
The CW-CWHS was subjected to a positive high voltage ranging from 9 to 12 kV. To capture the primary flow field gradients, ionic wind velocity measurements were conducted at intersections of three radially symmetric reference lines (45° intervals) with both inner and outer flow tracks. A hot-wire anemometer sampled instantaneous velocities at each measurement point, with the track-averaged wind speed serving as the validation benchmark for streamline analysis (Fig. 8). Comparative analysis demonstrated strong agreement between experimental measurements and numerical predictions regarding corona wind velocity's voltage-dependent trend. However, a pronounced discrepancy emerged at lower voltages (<11 kV), where air ionization instability between electrodes caused significant output fluctuations. Beyond 11 kV, the relative error stabilized at ∼6.5 %, validating the numerical model's accuracy under stable ionization conditions.

4. Results analysis and discussion
4.1. Effect of structural parameters on corona wind flow characteristics
Numerical simulation research based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can reveal the complex three-dimensional flow characteristics inside a corona wind heat sink. During preliminary research, the effect of the heat sink fins was ignored, and it was assumed that the distribution pattern of corona wind between adjacent fins was uniform. Focus was placed on characterizing the flow patterns generated by the emitter-collector electrode assembly under varying structural parameters. The numerical results in Fig. 9(a) demonstrate distinct electrohydrodynamic flow phenomena under corona discharge conditions. Charged particles undergo unidirectional migration from emitter to collector under electric field dominance, inducing macroscopic convection through momentum exchange with neutral gas molecules. Upon reaching the collector surface, the flow manifests as distinct flow separation phenomena: (1) Formation of counter-rotating vortical structures constrained by fixed plates, which recirculate to the emitter region and augment turbulent mixing in upper fin zones. (2) Radial propagation along the substrate surface effectively thins the thermal boundary layer in lower fin regions and the substrate surface, thereby enhancing the convective heat transfer efficiency. This flow bifurcation arises from synergistic interactions between geometric configuration and discharge parameters.

Fig. 9. Flow distribution characteristics of corona wind under varied discharge spacing.

Our parametric investigation focuses on four critical structural variables: discharge spacing (L), emitter's longitudinal height (H), collector width (W), and fixing plate height (T). Notably, operating voltage (U) primarily modulates flow field intensity without significantly altering spatial distribution patterns. Numerical validation under baseline conditions (H = 20 mm, W = 40 mm, T = 45 mm, U = 12 kV) reveals: (1) Flow field expansion with increased 'L' (5∼15 mm) enhances vortical flow penetration and convective interaction with substrate-fin structures, as shown in Fig. 9(c). (2) The critical threshold value of 'L' is 10 mm, beyond this value, the space charge density decays exponentially (Fig. 9(d)), the interfacial momentum transfer efficiency decreases, and the thermal boundary layer disturbance intensity reduces. Structural constraints analysis indicates that excessive 'L' values (>10 mm) will decrease the effective heat transfer area and induce flow stagnation zones to reduce heat rejection efficiency. Meanwhile, it will result in an insufficient insulation distance between the emitter and the metal fins, easily causing dielectric breakdown at a working voltage of 12 kV and destroying the discharge stability. Through previous experimental research, it was found that the spacing between the emitter and the fin edge should be maintained at ≥ 10 mm to ensure electrical safety. Through multi-physics optimization considering both aerodynamic performance and electromechanical safety, the recommended discharge spacing range is 5∼10 mm.
The discharge spacing was maintained at 10 mm with other parameters held constant (W = 35 mm, T = 45 mm, U = 12 kV) to systematically investigate the influence of the emitter's longitudinal height 'H' (10–25 mm range) on corona wind flow characteristics. As illustrated in Fig. 10(a), variations in 'H' fundamentally alter near-wall flow development space and streamline patterns from fluid dynamics perspectives. At H = 10 mm, pronounced wall confinement effects induce significant pressure gradients, restricting flow channels and generating reverse flow phenomena in the substrate's near-wall region (Fig. 10(b)). This recirculation vortex formation stems from viscous-inertia interactions coupled with adverse pressure gradients, directly diminishing heat transfer coefficients in fin-extended regions. Conversely, when 'H' increases to 25 mm, while the lower vortex escapes substrate constraint, premature flow separation triggers upper vortex formation that inadequately covers fin tip areas, failing to establish effective turbulent mixing. Comparative analysis on streamline (Fig. 10(c)) reveals optimal performance at H ≈ 19 mm, where the flow field demonstrates ideal boundary layer progression. The lower region achieves stabilized near-wall flow, enhancing substrate-fin base convective transfer, while the upper vortex expands coverage over fin apex zones. This dual-regime flow synergy maximizes thermal dissipation efficiency through complementary mechanisms: sustained viscous shear in lower regions and enhanced turbulent momentum transport in upper domains. The height optimization essentially balances flow development lengthscale with turbulence intensity requirements. At H = 19 mm, wall shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy reach an optimal equilibrium ratio, corroborating Vishnu et al.'s [26] findings on confined flow stabilization. The 10–25 mm parametric window ensures sufficient near-wall flow development while preserving turbulence modulation capacity. This configuration achieves a reduction in total thermal resistance compared to baseline designs, demonstrating viability for high-power electronics cooling applications. Critical insights emerge regarding spatial confinement effects on electrohydrodynamic flows-excessive restriction promotes viscous dissipation dominance, while overextension permits premature flow separation, both detrimental to thermal performance.

Fig. 10. Flow distribution characteristics of corona wind under varied ‘H’.

The numerical simulation outcomes depicted in Fig. 11 reveal that modifying the collector's width (W) within 5∼35 mm exerts negligible influence on the spatial configuration of corona wind flow fields. The primary consequence of W-value augmentation lies in the radial enlargement of space charge distribution, characterized by attenuated charge density gradients and enhanced ionization efficiency in atmospheric media. This phenomenon suggests that electrode geometry optimization predominantly affects charge transport dynamics rather than macroscopic airflow patterns, with the expanded charge distribution area facilitating more uniform ionization processes across the inter-electrode region (see Fig. 12).

Fig. 12. Flow distribution characteristics of corona wind under different ‘T’.

The variation in fixed plate height (T = 45 mm, 55 mm) significantly influences the flow field characteristics in the upper emitter region, as demonstrated through systematic analysis. Experimental observations reveal that incremental increases in ‘T’ values induce a proportional expansion of the vortex core area within the upper section, exhibiting analogous characteristics to flow field transformations occurring during critical reductions of emitter height ‘H’. This phenomenon is attributed to analogous hydrodynamic mechanisms governing vertical confinement effects in both scenarios. Furthermore, simulations confirm that the modified flow patterns in the upper region demonstrate Reynolds number-dependent scaling behavior, with vortex core dimensions increasing by 18–22 % per 10 mm T-value increment.
Parameter sensitivity analysis has identified pronounced multivariate coupling interactions among emitter height, collector width, and fixed plate height. These nonlinear interdependencies render conventional univariate sequential optimization approaches inadequate for achieving global optima due to their inherent limitations in addressing cross-parameter synergies. To overcome this multi-objective optimization complexity, the present research proposes a response surface prediction framework grounded in Box-Behnken experimental design. The methodology employs quadratic regression equations to systematically quantify the relative influence weights of individual structural parameters and their interaction terms on hydrodynamic performance metrics.
4.2. Response surface methodology-driven structural optimization
Response surface methodology (RSM), a statistically robust multivariate optimization technique grounded in regression analysis, demonstrates extensive applicability across industrial, agricultural, biological, and mineralogical domains [[27], [28], [29], [30]], particularly excelling in material ratio formulation, structural parameter analysis, and systematic design optimization [[31], [32], [33], [34]]. Its versatility is evidenced by interdisciplinary implementations: CFD-RSM hybrid models have enhanced sprayer fan thrust through aerodynamic parameter optimization [35]; ultrasonic-assisted osmotic dehydration parameters in sweet potato processing were systematically calibrated via RSM [36]; and modified RSM approaches have resolved protein dislocation challenges by optimizing sodium hydroxide concentration, ultrasonic power, and phase ratios [37]. Building upon preliminary investigations into corona wind flow field dynamics, where sequential parameter studies proved insufficient for comprehensive factor interaction analysis, we adopted RSM to construct predictive regression models. This methodology enables multi-level parameter exploration to identify optimal structural configurations that maximize corona wind intensity (
) through systematic response surface evaluation.
4.2.1. Corona wind intensity evaluation criterion
Given the non-steady-state characteristics of the corona wind flow field and the intricate internal flow dynamics within the system, direct volumetric flow rate measurement proves prohibitively difficult. To address this, a computational domain was constructed through radial cross-sectional modeling of the heat sink (Fig. 13(a)), with subsequent analysis concentrated on spatiotemporal velocity field patterns within the finned region (Fig. 13(b)). Leveraging experimentally validated calibration data, this research formulates a functional correlation between localized flow zones and corresponding aerodynamic parameters. The study identifies a critical threshold velocity of 0.6 m/s, beyond which a forced-convection boundary layer capable of satisfying thermal dissipation requirements becomes established. For systematic quantification of thermally active zones, exemplified by the contour-enclosed area in Fig. 13(c), a novel dimensionless parameter was introduced to characterize these critical regions.
(14)
Where ‘
’ is the area of thermally active zones (m2), ‘
’ is the mean corona wind velocity in the thermally active zones (m/s), ‘
’ is the operating power (W). The parameter ‘
’, serving as a quantitative indicator of corona wind intensity, is physically defined as the volumetric energy dissipation generated during ion-driven airflow processes. This characterization aligns with experimental methodologies for evaluating corona wind performance through energy transfer analysis in boundary layer dynamics.

Fig. 13. Schematic diagram of the thermally active zones.

The discharge voltage was configured at 12 kV, with multiple structural parameter combinations randomly selected as control groups to validate the feasibility of the proposed methodology. As illustrated in Fig. 14, variations in structural parameter combinations induced significant alterations in both the effective flow area and mean velocity of corona wind within the unit. These parametric changes directly correlated with a nonlinear oscillatory pattern observed in the enhancement coefficient (
), characterized by pronounced extremum behavior across different parameter sets. Specifically, an optimal parameter configuration was identified that maximized the internal flow characteristics of the device, achieving targeted performance metrics. This confirms the applicability of the proposed parameter optimization framework for enhancing corona wind heat sink efficacy, as evidenced by the quantifiable improvements in convective heat transfer efficiency under optimized structural conditions. The results substantiate the method's capacity to systematically identify parameter combinations that maximize thermofluidic performance through targeted flow field modulation.

4.2.2. Level settings of design variables and ‘
’ computation results
To systematically evaluate parameter influence effects, this study implemented a three-level factorial design (−1, 0, 1) with structural parameters detailed in Table 3. This methodology demonstrates four key advantages: precise quantification of main and interaction effects through ANOVA decomposition; adaptability to multi-objective optimization frameworks via response surface modeling; simultaneous achievement of structural compactness and experimental rigor through dimension-reduced configurations; and inherent robustness against operational variability in practical implementations. The optimization protocol maximized corona wind disturbance intensity on heat sink fins while maintaining discharge stability, ultimately achieving peak device performance. For multi-factor coupling analysis, the enhanced convection index (
) was designated as the optimization target, with critical structural parameters (discharge spacing, emitter longitudinal height, collector width, and fixed plate installation height) constituting a four-factor, three-level experimental matrix. Following Box-Behnken design principles, we executed 25 numerical simulations using an L9(34) orthogonal array, with specific parameter combinations and response values systematically cataloged in Table 4. This approach ensures a statistically rigorous exploration of parameter space while maintaining computational efficiency through balanced orthogonal combinations.

4.2.3. Predictive model and significance testing
Response surface methodology establishes a functional relationship between independent variables and system responses through quadratic polynomial regression modeling, with its generalized form expressed in Eq. (15). Utilizing the dataset from Table 4, a coded factor regression model incorporating interaction terms and quadratic terms was developed (Eq. (16)), where ‘
’ serves as the response variable. This model systematically optimizes parameter combinations via stepwise regression analysis to quantitatively delineate the nonlinear relationships between coded structural parameters ‘L’, ‘H’, ‘W’, ‘T’, and system performance. The formulation eliminates ambiguous descriptors by precisely defining variable interactions through rigorous statistical parameterization, ensuring both computational efficiency and theoretical robustness in characterizing complex system behaviors.

(16)
The quadratic polynomial regression model constructed via the Box-Behnken design method was rigorously validated through integrated analysis of variance (ANOVA) and residual diagnostics, as detailed in Table 5. With all factor significance probabilities (P < 0.0001) demonstrating statistical validity at a 99.99 % confidence level, the model exhibits robust predictive capability. Linear terms of independent variables (L, H, W, T) showed significant influence on the flow enhancement index (P < 0.05), with F-value magnitudes ranked as L (106.98) > H (80.65) > W (56.62) > T (11.8), quantitatively delineating parameter-specific impact intensities. The model's explanatory power was evidenced by a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9728), accounting for 97.28 % of response variability, while the adjusted R2 (0.9347) confirmed appropriate parameter incorporation. The marginal difference between these metrics (0.0381) combined with an Adeq Precision value of 17.48—substantially exceeding the threshold of 4-validates both model parsimony and high signal-to-noise resolution. Predictive accuracy was further corroborated by the tight clustering of predicted versus observed values (95 % confidence interval bandwidth < ±2.5 %) in Fig. 15, complemented by standardized residual analysis showing no systematic deviations. These collective metrics substantiate the model's capacity to nonlinearly characterize structure-flow performance relationships while maintaining exceptional generalization capacity, thereby establishing a statistically rigorous foundation for structural optimization endeavors.

4.2.4. Response surface analysis and optimization results
This study employed a three-dimensional response surface methodology to systematically investigate the interaction mechanisms among critical structural parameters influencing the flow enhancement coefficient ‘
’. Analysis of Fig. 16(a)–(c) revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between discharge spacing ‘L’ and ‘
’, with optimal flow field enhancement observed at L = 9 mm. Furthermore, the surface characteristics in Fig. 16(a–d,e) identified a global extremum of ‘
’ occurring at an emitter longitudinal height H = 20 mm, a finding that corroborates previous single-factor flow field investigations and reinforces methodological validity. The developed second-order regression model successfully resolved the coupling optimization problem involving ‘H’, collector width ‘W’, and fixed plate height ‘T’, demonstrating the response surface method's superior capability in multi-parameter collaborative optimization compared to conventional single-factor approaches. Validation results in Table 6 showed exceptional agreement between experimental measurements 247.25 × 10−6 m3/J and model predictions 240.44 × 10−6 m3/J, yielding a minimal 2.75 % error margin. This precise alignment not only confirms the model's predictive accuracy but also substantiates its engineering applicability for optimizing complex flow field configurations.

4.3. Effects of heat sink fin arrangement on flow characteristics
As illustrated in Fig. 17, the CW-CWHS demonstrates a markedly divergent flow morphology compared to conventional rectangular counterparts, with fin geometry parameters governing this hydrodynamic characteristic. A three-dimensional numerical model encompassing four representative fin inclination angles (15°, 22.5°, 30°, and 45°) reveals that sub-22.5° configurations induce substantial flow separation within fin channels, augmenting boundary layer thickness through intensified secondary flow resistance. Conversely, 45° installations reduce flow resistance but compromise thermal performance through diminished surface area. The 30° configuration emerges as optimal, achieving synergistic enhancement between divergent flow patterns and axial momentum transfer through suppressed flow separation, uniform velocity distribution, and rational radial velocity component ratios while maintaining adequate fin density and heat dissipation capacity (see Fig. 18).

Fig. 18. Corona wind flow characteristics under varying auxiliary fin length.

Notably, localized flow separation persists at fin tip regions (Fig. 17), prompting the implementation of hierarchical fin architectures based on boundary layer control principles. Auxiliary fins (10–20 mm length) originating from substrate edges generate controlled secondary flows that reconstruct velocity boundary layers at primary fin trailing edges [38], enabling corona wind kinetic energy recuperation. While 20-mm secondary fins induce premature transverse pressure gradient interference, 15-mm variants optimally balance flow guidance effectiveness (comparable to 10-mm units) with augmented heat transfer surface area. This parametric optimization confirms 15 mm as the ideal auxiliary fin length through a comprehensive evaluation of hydrodynamic-thermal coupling effects.
4.4. Thermal performance characterization and experimental validation
The optimized structural parameters were utilized to fabricate a CW-CWHS, which was subsequently employed for investigating thermal transfer characteristics. During experimental validation, a ceramic heating element (Model: CT-JRP303020, Manufacturer: Beijing Xinxin Century Industrial Control Company) served as the heat source, with temperature measurements executed at precisely positioned measurement nodes illustrated in Fig. 3(a) using K-type thermocouples. The acquired temperature data were systematically recorded and archived in a dedicated computational database, while ancillary experimental apparatuses maintained configurations as schematically depicted in Fig. 3. The cooling performance of the heat sink was systematically evaluated through localized convective heat transfer coefficients derived from substrate surface measurements, complemented by spatially resolved Nusselt number distribution analysis. This methodology enabled precise characterization of thermal regulation effectiveness across the operational domain. The associated uncertainty in determining the heat transfer coefficient (h) was quantified via Eq. (19), adhering to standardized error propagation protocols.

In external flow analyses across heat sinks, 'l' denotes the characteristic length parameter. The determination of this parameter is contingent upon the emitter height, introducing an uncertainty analogous to that inherent in the methodology employed for calculating insulation cotton thickness. The specific standards are as follows.:

.
The experiment was conducted with the heating plate operating at 15.5 W until thermal equilibrium was achieved, after which the corona wind heat sink was activated for cooling. As illustrated in Fig. 19, all measurement points exhibited rapid temperature escalation during the heating phase, stabilizing after 13 min with the heating plate peaking at 78.8 °C while the fins and substrate attained their respective thermal maxima. Subsequent activation of the corona wind heat sink induced turbulent flow through direct impingement on the finned surfaces, augmenting convective heat transfer and precipitating rapid temperature reductions across all monitored locations, though the heating plate demonstrated marginally slower cooling kinetics compared to the other measurement points. Systematic voltage elevation in the corona wind system revealed a proportional acceleration of cooling rates, with performance saturation occurring near the dielectric breakdown threshold, where maximum corona wind velocity and heat sink capacity were attained. This operational limit manifested as attenuated cooling gradients, culminating in thermal stabilization after 30 min with the heating plate maintaining 60.9 °C, representing a 17.9 °C reduction from peak values. Comparative analysis suggests this equilibrium temperature would reside 20 °C below typical LEDs' junction temperature thresholds, conclusively demonstrating the system's efficacy in thermal management applications.

Fig. 19. Temperature variations before and after cooling.

To systematically evaluate the cooling performance of heat sinks before and after optimization, this study implemented probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling methodology, constructing experimental control groups proportional to parametric dimensions as specified in Table 4 (detailed in Table 7). Through rigorous analysis of local convective heat transfer coefficient ‘h’ and Nusselt number ‘Nu’ distributions across the substrate surface, complemented by enhanced flow coefficient ‘
 Variations, a comprehensive performance assessment was conducted. Fig. 20 demonstrates a pronounced positive correlation between ‘Nu’ and ‘
’, with ‘
’ peaking at the optimal parametric configuration (L = 9 mm, H = 20 mm, W = 35 mm, T = 45 mm). Notably, emitter longitudinal height H = 25 mm (Groups 7–8) facilitated fully developed substrate flow, elevating ‘Nu’ through characteristic length ‘l’ augmentation under fixed heat sink dimensions. This mechanism reduces corona wind confinement by diminishing pressure gradients perpendicular to streamlines, thereby enhancing flow development. However, previous studies emphasize that ‘H’ optimization requires synergistic parameter interactions to maximize system performance. Final validation under optimized parameters yielded Uk = 247.25 × 10−6 m3/J, h = 43 W/(m2•K), Nu = 46.44, and mean temperature T = 60.9 °C, demonstrating that the CW-CWHS achieves superior heat transfer through balanced flow resistance-convection synergy.

5. Conclusions
This study proposes a monolithic corona wind heat sink design for advanced thermal regulation in high-power LED chip applications. A coupled computational and experimental framework was developed to systematically optimize structural parameters through parametric sensitivity analysis and response surface methodology.
(1)
The discharge spacing exhibits an inverse correlation with peak velocity magnitude but a positive relationship with domain-averaged flow rate. Optimal emitter positioning at mid-channel height (20 mm) minimizes near-wall pressure gradients, thereby stabilizing corona wind distribution patterns and enhancing convective transport efficiency.
(2)
Response surface optimization identified discharge spacing as the dominant factor (contribution rate: 42.6 %) in the flow enhancement coefficient (
) maximization, followed by the emitter's longitudinal height (28.1 %), collector width (19.7 %), and fixing plate height (9.6 %). The Pareto-optimal configuration demonstrated 9 mm spacing for balanced ionization efficiency and energy dissipation, coupled with a 35 mm collector width and 44 mm fixing plate height. This geometric arrangement achieved an 18.7 % improvement in ' 
' compared to baseline designs, facilitating intensified momentum transfer within constrained flow domains.
(3)
Fin architecture optimization introduced bifurcated flow guidance through primary-secondary fin arrays, where 30° primary fin inclination promoted flow divergence while 15 mm auxiliary fins suppressed recirculation zones. It confirmed a big reduction in flow separation areas compared to conventional parallel-fin layouts, translating to enhanced thermal boundary layer disruption. The hybrid fin configuration improved local Nusselt numbers by 31.2 % through a synergistic combination of accelerated core flows and optimized surface contact duration.
(4)
Experimental validation under a 12 kV voltage demonstrated rapid thermal stabilization within 900 s, achieving a temperature reduction of 17.9 °C (from 78.8 °C to 60.9 °C) under a 15.5 W heat load. The optimized device exhibited a flow enhancement coefficient (Uk) of 247.25 × 10−6 m3/J and a convective heat transfer coefficient (h) of 43 W/(m2·K), representing improvements of 37.2 % and 16.1 %, respectively, over the unoptimized structure. The local Nusselt number (Nu) reached 46.44, outperforming conventional forced convection solutions by 40–60 % under comparable power budgets. Transient thermal analysis revealed subsecond-scale responsiveness to load variations, underscoring the device's potential for dynamic thermal management applications.
(5)
It demonstrates that insufficient emitter-to-fin spacing (<10 mm) under high voltage induces air breakdown, compromising experimental accuracy and stability—a threshold established through rigorous repeat testing. Current limitations include flow field disturbances from the emitter's complex fixation structure and suboptimal power-electrode insulation. Targeted resolution of these issues could enhance the coreless ionic wind heat sink's performance by 15–20 % while reducing volume by 30 %, advancing its industrial applicability.
The developed multi-physics optimization framework provides a generalized methodology for electrohydrodynamic cooling device design, particularly valuable for high-flux thermal management scenarios exceeding 200 W/cm2. Subsequent integration with micro heat pipe phase-change systems could enable hybrid cooling architectures combining corona wind's rapid response with latent heat storage cap
