Abstract
Monitoring load transfer mechanisms in pile foundations is particularly critical in cold regions, where frozen soil properties, such as adfreeze bonding and temperature-induced deformation, complicate stress measurements and long-term performance evaluations. Although strain gauges are widely used in structural testing, their performance under low temperatures and freeze-thaw cycles requires further validation. This study systematically evaluates strain gauge reliability under coupled thermal and mechanical loading and applies the validated sensors to model tests of steel pipe piles in frozen soils, thereby linking laboratory evaluation with engineering practice. To examine measurement stability and accuracy, laboratory experiments were carried out under controlled temperature variations and cyclic loading. Results indicated that strain gauges maintained stable performance from −10.0 to +20.0 °C, while cyclic axial loading tests showed good repeatability, with mean absolute percentage errors generally below 5.0 %. The fitted elastic modulus (0.19 × 106 MPa) also closely matched the theoretical value (0.20 × 106 MPa). Application to model pile tests demonstrated that the gauges effectively captured axial force distribution, shaft resistance, and end resistance under different loading levels, reflecting the nonlinear load transfer behavior of piles in frozen soils. These findings demonstrate that, when properly validated and calibrated, strain gauges offer a reliable and cost-effective solution for structural sensing in cold-region foundations. Beyond laboratory insights, the study underscores their potential for long-term field applications, offering practical value for infrastructure risk assessment and design in permafrost and seasonally frozen regions.

1. Introduction
In the Northern Hemisphere, frozen soils cover extensive portions of the land surface, with perennially frozen ground, seasonally frozen ground, and intermittently frozen ground comprising approximately 23.9 %, 50.5 %, and 6.6 % of the total exposed land area, respectively (Zhang et al., 2003). Since the late nineteenth century, steel pipe piles have been extensively employed in frozen soil engineering, guided by the principle of preserving frozen ground integrity. Their application has become widespread in construction, transportation infrastructure, and energy delivery projects in cold regions of countries such as Japan, China, the United States and Canada (Matsumoto et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2017; Aldaeef and Rayhani, 2021; Wang et al., 2025). With the growing concerns regarding infrastructure stability in permafrost regions, accurate monitoring techniques are essential to evaluate the thermal and mechanical interactions between foundations and frozen soils (Duvillard et al., 2021; Hjort et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2024). Therefore, reliable evaluation of pile performance is particularly important in these regions, where adfreeze strength and soil creep significantly influence the pile-soil interaction (Zhang et al., 2023; Tabatabaei et al., 2024).
In this context, accurate monitoring of axial force distribution and load transfer mechanisms is essential for ensuring the long-term stability of frozen ground infrastructure, yet the harsh thermal and mechanical conditions present unique challenges for sensing technologies. Several options are available for monitoring axial loads in pile foundations, including strain gauges, rebar stress meters, sliding micrometers, and fiber optic measurement systems (Gao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). Each technique has advantages and limitations in terms of sensitivity, installation complexity, and environmental adaptability. For example, rebar stress meters or vibrating wire strain sensors must account for thermal expansion and frost heave to maintain accuracy (Bartz and Blatz, 2022), while sliding micrometers and fiber optic sensors, though reliable in standard geotechnical settings, require further validation in frozen soils due to alignment challenges and signal attenuation (Wu et al., 2021; Bednarski et al., 2024). Strain gauges offer a promising alternative because of their compact size, high sensitivity, and ease of integration into structural elements (Mohanty et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2019), although their performance remains susceptible to temperature-induced effects and bonding quality issues, such as resistance drift and mismatched thermal expansion between the sensor and the host material (Shuai, 2017).
The quality of adhesion between the strain gauge and the test material plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable measurements. Even minor defects at the bonding nterface can cause significant errors, making surface preparation and adhesive selection crucial, especially in harsh environments (Wilson, 1976). Early research conducted in China by Zhang et al. (1995) demonstrated the feasibility of using strain gauges for frozen soil testing by developing a bonding technique that ensured high sensitivity and measurement reliability at low temperatures. Thermal effects on strain measurement have also been emphasized in studies on vibrating wire strain gauges. Wang and Wei (2012), and Shao (2004) found that the thermal expansion of the steel wire could introduce apparent strains of approximately 12 × 10−6 to 13 × 10−6/°C if uncorrected, underscoring the importance of accounting for the thermal coefficients of specific materials. In addition to errors caused by temperature variations, changes in axial pile stiffness due to concrete cracking or thermal restraint can lead to deviations in load calculations based on strain. Sinnreich (2011) proposed an incremental load-strain method to address nonlinearity in stiffness, highlighting the need for more refined interpretation models when using strain gauges for pile monitoring. Furthermore, Takeuchi and Kusumoto (1972) showed that resistance strain gauges could underestimate strain in materials with low modulus because of local stiffening effects, particularly when the modulus of the strain gauge greatly exceeds that of the base material. They proposed correction factors to improve strain measurement accuracy under such conditions.
Given these challenges, this study conducts a comprehensive performance assessment of strain gauges under simulated frozen soil conditions. Strain gauges are bonded to steel pipes made of the same material used in the subsequent model pile tests, and subjected to controlled temperature and loading experiments to simulate the thermal and mechanical interactions typical of cold regions. Following validation, the strain gauges are applied in indoor model tests of steel pipe piles embedded in artificially frozen soils. The findings provide a technical basis for improving the reliability of strain gauge measurements in permafrost pile foundations.
2. Methodology
The present research consists of two main experimental components: a performance assessment test of strain gauges and a model pile test using steel pipe piles embedded in frozen soils.
2.1. Sensor performance evaluation under cold-region conditions
The sensor performance evaluation aims to assess the reliability and accuracy of strain gauges under conditions that simulate environments typical of cold regions. This evaluation comprises three parts: temperature control tests, reliability tests and accuracy tests, which are elaborated upon in Section 2.1.2.
2.1.1. Steel pipe parameters and sensor layout
The specimens used in the tests were made of Q345 carbon steel and had dimensions of 200.0 mm in length, 50.0 mm in outer diameter, and 2.0 mm in wall thickness. Three monitoring sections were arranged along the pipe at equal intervals of 50.0 mm. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a pair of strain gauges was symmetrically positioned at each section to counteract the potential impact of eccentric loading on the measurement results. The strain gauges used were model BE120-3AA, with a base size of 6.4 mm in length and 3.5 mm in width. Further specifications are provided in Table 1. The adhesive used for bonding was B-711 (Zhonghang Electronic Measuring Instruments Co., Ltd., China), suitable for temperatures from −30 to +120 °C. The outer protective coating was Nanda 704 (Liyang Kangda New Materials Co., Ltd., China), with a range of −60 to +250 °C, providing sealing and insulation functions.

2.1.2. Test system design
The tests are divided into three parts: temperature control tests, reliability tests, and accuracy tests (Table 2). The temperature control tests aim to investigate the effect of temperature variation on strain gauge measurements without the influence of vertical loading. The reliability tests are designed to evaluate the variation in strain gauge measurements under different loading and temperature conditions, using evaluation metrics such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), defined as the average of the absolute percentage differences between measured and reference values, and data stability. The accuracy tests adopt the same load-control procedure as in the reliability tests, but use the comparison between the measured and theoretical elastic modulus (
) as the evaluation criterion.

2.1.3. Loading equipment and data acquisition system
The tests were conducted using a CMT5105 universal testing machine equipped with a microcomputer control system. A schematic view of the testing machine is provided in Fig. 2(a), while Fig. 2(b) shows the actual equipment. The system features a closed-loop control system for test force, strain, and displacement rate, and offers real-time dynamic feedback on load application, displacement, velocity, and test progression curves. Load and temperature control functions are integrated into the system. The maximum load capacity reaches 100.0 kN. Control accuracy is maintained at ±0.1 % of the set value for loads exceeding 10 % of full scale, and ± 1.0 % for those below this threshold. The force control rate was set to 0.5 kN/s. Temperature control is achievable within the range of −22 to +30 °C, with an accuracy of ±1 °C.

Data acquisition was carried out using a system comprising a DH3816 unit (Fig. 2(c)), a desktop computer (Fig. 2(d)), and dedicated acquisition software. The DH3816 features automatic balancing and an internal standard resistor, supporting flexible configurations for full-bridge, half-bridge, and quarter-bridge connections. Considering the significant temperature fluctuations in the test, a half-bridge connection was adopted (Hu et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2018). Further technical specifications are summarized in Table 3.

2.2. Model pile test
The material used for the steel pipe pile is the same as described in Section 2.1, measuring 850.0 mm in length, 50.0 mm in outer diameter, and 1.5 mm in wall thickness. Detailed information on the model box dimensions, sensor arrangement, and loading method is provided in Fig. 3. Two types of soils were selected for the test, namely silt and silty clay. Their detailed physical parameters are summarized in Table 4. The loading equipment used was an RSM-JC6(C) static load testing instrument (Fig. 3(c)), which is a highly automated device composed of a main control unit, a numerical control box, an oil pump, and a jack. It offers a high degree of automation and is suitable for various complex testing environments.

Silty clay	300–650	22.8	35.1	29.8	1.54	2.72
The test was conducted under a constant temperature of −1.5 °C, controlled by upper and lower cooling plates. A staged loading and unloading protocol was adopted. The loading phase consisted of seven stages at −7.2, −11.4, −16.1, −21.6, −26.7, −31.4, and − 36.3 kN. The unloading phase included five stages at −31.8, −21.7, −11.3, −5.8, and 0.0 kN. Axial load distribution, shaft resistance, and end bearing capacity were calculated from strain gauge measurements at various pile sections, following the methods prescribed in the Chinese technical standard JGJ 106–2014 (MHURDPRC, 2014). Specifically, the axial force at each section was calculated using:

3. Results
For consistency, compressive loads are considered negative and tensile loads positive throughout this study.
3.1. Performance assessment test results
3.1.1. Temperature control tests
During the temperature control tests, no vertical load was exerted on the top of the steel pipe, while the temperature was varied between −10 °C and + 20 °C. The relationship between strain readings at different cross sections and temperature variation is shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that although some fluctuations in strain measurements occurred with temperature changes, the overall fluctuation range remained small. The maximum recorded compressive strain was −5.5 με, and the maximum tensile strain was 6.42 με. This minimal variation is likely attributed to the combined effect of the intrinsic temperature compensation of the strain gauges and the use of a half-bridge wiring configuration in the data acquisition system, which together reduced the influence of temperature changes to a negligible level (Holmes and Moore, 1992; Abu-Mahfouz, 2022).

3.1.2. Reliability tests
The reliability tests consisted of two parts: constant-temperature variable-load tests (CT-VL) and constant-load variable-temperature tests (CL-VT).
(1)
CT-VL test.
The test was performed under a constant temperature of −1.5 °C, while the applied load was cyclically varied between −8.0 kN and − 30.0 kN. All loads remained within the elastic deformation range of the steel pipe. Fig. 5 shows the strain response at different cross sections under varying loads. As the load increased, the strain at each measurement point exhibited a clear upward trend, reaching its peak when the load reached −30.0 kN. Upon unloading, the strain gradually returned to its initial state. Although the magnitude of strain varied across different locations, all strain curves exhibited strong synchronization with the load variation. The red curve (strain gauge 1–2) showed the largest strain amplitude.

Fig. 6 presents the comparison of strain measurements under repeated identical load levels before and after the cyclic loading. With increasing load levels, the MAPE between repeated measurements decreased. This trend can be explained by the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (Sujatha, 2023). At low load levels, strain signals are comparable to background noise and bonding imperfections, leading to relatively high errors. As the load increases, the strain signal grows while noise remains nearly constant, reducing the relative impact of these effects and thereby lowering the MAPE. For all cross sections, the strains measured by gauges 1–2, 2–2, and 3–2 were consistently higher than those measured by 1–1, 2–1, and 3–1, respectively. Except for a few larger MAPE values under the −8.0 kN condition, the strain gauges showed low error levels at all other load stages. These results indicate good performance of the strain gauges within the elastic range, with minimal influence from residual deformation.

The test was conducted to evaluate the measurement stability of strain gauges under a fixed axial load of −30.0 kN, with temperature fluctuations ranging from +3.0 to −3.0 °C. Fig. 7 shows the variation of strain and temperature over time at different cross sections along the steel pipe. As the temperature changed, the strain at all measurement points exhibited varying degrees of fluctuation, ranging between −520 με and − 730 με. A noticeable trend was observed in which the strain first decreased and then gradually recovered during each temperature transition, though a lag in response was present. This lag arises because the strain gauge system (sensitive grid, substrate, adhesive, and steel pipe) does not achieve thermal equilibrium instantly (Jin et al., 2023). The resulting thermal mismatch produces a temporary apparent strain that disappears once the system stabilizes.

According to the results of the aforementioned three tests, the strain gauges demonstrated strong stability under combined effects of both positive and negative temperature variations and axial loading. The strain-time curves were generally smooth, with no abrupt changes observed. In addition, the measurements under repeated identical load levels exhibited good repeatability, further confirming the reliability of the strain gauges. These characteristics indicate that the selected strain gauges are well-suited for strain monitoring in complex test environments.
3.1.3. Accuracy tests
As part of the accuracy evaluation, stress and strain data were obtained from the CT-VL test described in Section 3.1.2. The measured elastic modulus was calculated based on linear fitting of the stress-strain relationship and compared with the theoretical value specified in relevant design codes to assess measurement accuracy. Fig. 8 shows the variation of average strain and load over time at three different cross sections. For each section, the average value of two symmetrically placed strain gauges was used. This averaging approach effectively reduces the influence of eccentric loading, which is one of the main reasons for adopting symmetric gauge placement in the experiment.

Test data were used to calculate average stress and strain values for the steel pipe, yielding the stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 9. The red curve represents the fitted elastic modulus with a 95 % confidence interval, while the green curve indicates the theoretical elastic modulus. The fitted elastic modulus of the steel pipe was obtained as 0.19 × 106 MPa, which is very close to the theoretical value of 0.20 × 106 MPa. The fitting results also showed a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.999), reflecting the strong linearity of the data. Because the number of fitting points was relatively limited, the variance was small, leading to a narrow confidence interval. This strong agreement confirms the measurement accuracy of the strain gauges and demonstrates their feasibility for load monitoring in frozen soil model tests.

3.2. Application to load transfer analysis in frozen soils
The load-displacement behavior of the steel pipe pile is illustrated in Fig. 10, showing its structural response under loading and unloading conditions. During the loading phase (black curve), as the load increased gradually from 0.0 to −36.3 kN, the displacement increased linearly from 0.0 to 1.25 mm. This near-linear trend indicates good bearing performance of the pile within the elastic range. In the unloading phase (red curve), the displacement gradually recovered as the load decreased. However, the unloading path did not fully coincide with the loading curve, showing a certain degree of hysteresis. This behavior can be attributed to plastic deformation of the material and frictional effects at the pile-frozen soil interface.

Fig. 11 shows the axial load profile along the depth of the pile under various pile head loads, which illustrates the load transmission characteristics of the steel pipe pile. As the pile head load increases from −7.2 to −36.3 kN, the axial load gradually decreases along the depth in a nonlinear manner. This indicates that the applied load is progressively transferred into the adjacent frozen ground via a combination of shaft friction and end resistance. The spacing and shape of the curves at different loading levels suggest that as the pile head load increases, the rate of axial load attenuation becomes more pronounced, particularly in the mid-to-lower sections of the pile. This reflects the nonlinear nature of the pile-frozen soil interaction as a function of loading intensity.

Fig. 12 illustrates the variation of shaft resistance along the pile under different pile head loads. As the load increases from −7.2 to −36.3 kN, the shaft resistance exhibits a non-uniform distribution with depth. In the upper segment (0–300 mm), corresponding to the silt layer, the shaft resistance remains positive and increases gradually with loading. However, its magnitude is relatively small compared to deeper layers, indicating that this soil provides limited shear resistance and that the full side friction capacity has not yet been mobilized. This behavior corresponds well with the axial load attenuation trend observed in Fig. 11. In the intermediate segment (300–360 mm), negative shaft resistance appears, suggesting a downward drag force exerted by the surrounding soil on the pile. This phenomenon is likely related to the transition zone between the upper silt and the lower silty clay. Below this depth (360–650 mm), within the silty clay layer, the shaft resistance reverts to positive and increases significantly with load, indicating that the lower soil layer provides substantial lateral resistance to support the pile.

Fig. 13 presents the variation of end bearing load and its ratio relative to the total pile head load under different loading levels. With the increase in pile head load, a corresponding rise in end bearing load is observed, and its proportion shows an overall upward trend. Under a load of −7.2 kN, the end resistance accounts for approximately 47 % of the total load. With increasing load, this proportion gradually rises, reaching 74 % at the maximum applied load of −36.3 kN. This indicates that at higher load levels, the contribution of end resistance becomes more significant, and the primary load-bearing mechanism gradually shifts from shaft friction to end bearing.

These results confirm that the strain gauges effectively captured the load transfer behavior of the steel pipe pile in frozen soils. The consistent trends observed in axial load and frictional resistance under staged loading indicate good measurement reliability and resolution. Overall, the strain gauges proved suitable for monitoring pile-soil interaction and evaluating load distribution characteristics in cold-region model tests.
4. Discussion
4.1. Measurement performance and influencing factors
This study revealed both the overall stability and localized variability of strain gauge performance under frozen soil conditions. As shown in Table 5, the MAPE for most strain gauges remained below 5.0 % across the four repeated loading levels (−8.0, −14.0, −20.0, and − 25.0 kN), indicating good consistency. However, specific gauges such as 1–2, 2–2, and 3–2 exhibited noticeably higher MAPE values under low load levels, with gauge 3–2 reaching a maximum of 9.3 % at −8.0 kN. These elevated errors, compared to their symmetrically placed counterparts (1), suggest possible sources such as eccentric loading, adhesive inconsistencies, or local thermal gradients during bonding. These observations emphasize the importance of symmetric sensor layout and high quality bonding in strain monitoring under cold region conditions. Even minor asymmetry or bonding voids may lead to stress concentration or partial delamination, reducing the accuracy of strain transfer. Similar observations have been reported in other studies. Koval' and Boiko (1980) demonstrated that strain gauges maintained reliable performance over millions of cycles before fatigue-related failures appeared, highlighting the importance of installation quality and bonding durability under repeated loading. Likewise, Osborne et al. (2007) noted that improper installation, residual stresses, and external disturbances such as electromagnetic interference can significantly influence measurement accuracy, which aligns with the present finding that careful bonding and sensor placement are critical for reducing variability. For future applications, enhancing surface preparation protocols, selecting adhesives with greater temperature stability, and conducting preloading validation tests may help reduce variability and improve measurement fidelity.

Load (kN)/Strain gauge ID	1–1	1–2	2–1	2–2	3–1	3–2
−8.0	1.4 %	7.8 %	2.2 %	7.9 %	2.3 %	9.3 %
−14.0	0.2 %	4.2 %	1.1 %	4.1 %	0.6 %	4.4 %
−20.0	0.2 %	2.3 %	0.6 %	2.4 %	0.2 %	2.7 %
−25.0	0.2 %	1.2 %	0.3 %	1.2 %	0.0 %	1.4 %
In contrast, the results from the constant-load, variable-temperature test (Fig. 7) demonstrated excellent thermal stability across all gauges. Strain fluctuations remained minimal during temperature changes, confirming that the half-bridge wiring and internal temperature compensation effectively reduced measurement drift caused by thermal effects. A slight strain lag was also observed during the temperature cycles, indicating mild hysteretic behavior within the sensor-soil-pile system. This hysteresis may result from adhesive viscoelasticity or soil creep and could become more evident during long-term field monitoring under repeated freeze-thaw loading.
4.2. Load transfer behavior and physical interpretation
The axial load profile along the steel pipe piles in the frozen soil model tests (Fig. 11) exhibits a clear non-uniform decrease with depth, accompanied by an increasing share of end bearing resistance as the head load rises. This trend aligns closely with Penner and Goodrich's (1983) field observations, who reported that, once localized adfreeze effects were mitigated (by isolating piles from surface gravel), uplift stresses on steel pipe piles with a diameter of 169 mm fell from an anomalous 380 to about 40 kPa. This demonstrates that the bonding conditions between the soil and pile play a critical role in governing load transfer in soils prone to freezing. Similarly, in laboratory tests, Wu et al. (2007) found that side-shear (adfreeze) resistance on steel pipe piles in silty loess at −5.0 °C followed a parabolic depth profile, while end bearing resistance was nearly linear, and the proportion of end bearing increased with load. Our experiments under −1.5 °C confirm these patterns: side-shear dominates at shallow depths, then transitions to negative shear near soil-layer interfaces, and finally reverts to positive shear in deeper frozen clay layers (Fig. 12). Concurrently, the end-bearing ratio climbs steadily from 47 % at −7.2 kN head load to 74 % at −36.3 kN (Table 6).
Table 6. End bearing load and its ratio with increasing pile head load.

Pile head load (kN)	7.2	11.4	16.1	21.6	26.7	31.4	36.3
End bearing load(kN)	3.4	7.1	10.5	14.9	18.8	22.9	26.7
End bearing ratio (%)	47	62	65	69	70	73	74
Two main factors explain the rising end bearing share in our tests. First, the lower soil layer (frozen silty clay), develops stronger adfreeze bonds and higher shear strength than the overlying sandy silt, thus attenuating side-shear more rapidly with depth and shifting load to the pile toe. This corresponds with Aldaeef and Rayhani's (2019) finding that adfreeze strength in ice-rich clay significantly exceeds that in ice-poor sand and is highly sensitive to temperature. Second, our end load measurements rely on a load cell seated in fine sand beneath the pile toe; downward load transfer is somewhat constrained by this setup, causing a persistent increase in the measured end bearing proportion. Together, these observations confirm that strain gauge monitoring accurately captures the complex, depth dependent load-transfer mechanisms of steel pipe piles in frozen soils.
4.3. Comparison of sensor strategies for permafrost monitoring
Based on the techniques introduced earlier, this section provides a practical comparison of strain gauges with other commonly used sensors in pile axial load transfer monitoring, focusing on applicability, cost, and data reliability in both model tests and field conditions.
Rebar stress meters are widely employed in long-term geotechnical monitoring due to their stability and resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI). These sensors convert frequency changes into strain data and are well-suited for long term applications such as buildings and bridges (Shi et al., 2022a; Peng et al., 2020). However, in frozen soils, rebar stress meters are susceptible to frequency drift induced by temperature and require complex correction methods to compensate for creep and thermal effects (Shi et al., 2022b). Although they offer excellent long-term stability, their installation and calibration are more complicated and costly compared to strain gauges. Sliding micrometers provide measurements with high resolution along structural elements, allowing for detailed deformation profiling (Li et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). They are reliable for detecting settlement or bending in pile foundations. Nonetheless, as displacement-based instruments rather than direct strain sensors, their use in permafrost regions is limited. Freeze-thaw cycles and alignment difficulties hinder their performance, and their bulky form makes them unsuitable for compact model setups or distributed sensor arrays (Li, 1988). Fiber optic sensors based on Brillouin scattering offer distributed sensing of both strain and temperature with high spatial resolution (Hong et al., 2016; Seo, 2020). Immune to EMI, they are advantageous for large-scale infrastructure monitoring. However, their application in frozen ground is still limited due to the fragility of optical fibers, signal attenuation at low temperatures, and the complexity of installation in ice-bonded soils (Silveira et al., 2025; Sang et al., 2020).
Compared with these alternatives, strain gauges are compact, cost-effective, and relatively easy to install in both laboratory and field tests. Although strain gauges require careful attention to temperature calibration and bonding quality, they are generally more adaptable to frozen soil environments and have thus been widely adopted in studies conducted in cold regions. For full scale pile tests in such environments, a hybrid sensing strategy that combines strain gauges with fiber optic sensors or rebar stress meters is recommended. This integrated approach can leverage the strengths of each sensor type, thereby enhancing data accuracy, redundancy, and overall system robustness. To provide a systematic overview, the main features of these four sensor types are summarized in Table 7, including their measurement principles, operating temperature ranges, typical cost, advantages, and adaptability in frozen soil conditions.

5. Conclusion
This study evaluated the performance of strain gauges under low-temperature and loading conditions typical of frozen soils, and applied them to steel pipe pile model tests to analyze axial load transfer mechanisms. The following conclusions can be drawn:
1.
Strain gauges exhibited stable and repeatable responses across both thermal and mechanical loading conditions, demonstrating minimal drift when appropriate bonding procedures and temperature compensation were applied. Their small size and high sensitivity make them particularly effective for capturing localized deformation in frozen soil model tests.
2.
The pile axial load, shaft resistance, and end resistance derived from the model tests showed clear and interpretable links to soil freezing conditions, indicating that strain gauges can reliably capture the mechanism of load transfer in frozen soils. These results highlight their capability not only for measurement but also for advancing mechanistic understanding of pile behavior in cold regions.
3.
Comparison with alternative sensing technologies suggests that although vibrating wire stress meters, sliding micrometers, and fiber optic sensors each serve specific monitoring needs, strain gauges offer a favorable balance of accuracy, adaptability, and cost. This balance makes them particularly suitable for both laboratory and field applications in frozen soils.
4.
A hybrid monitoring strategy is recommended, combining strain gauges with complementary sensing technologies (e.g., fiber optics or vibrating wire meters) to enhance redundancy, long-term stability, and cross-validation capabilities in permafrost applications.
Overall, the findings demonstrate that, when properly validated and calibrated, strain gauges offer a reliable and cost-effective solution for cold-region foundation monitoring. Nevertheless, the controlled short-term laboratory setting cannot fully capture long-term processes such as creep, frost heave, and freeze-thaw degradation. Application to full-scale engineering should therefore be made with caution. Future work will address these challenges through extended field validation, enhanced sensor protection, and more robust calibration and data interpretation frameworks to support long-term monitoring in permafrost regions.
