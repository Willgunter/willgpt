Abstract
Boiling phase-change emerges as a superior thermal management solution for high-power electronics, overcoming the limitations of air cooling in immersion cooling systems for data centers. While liquid-vapor phase change offers exceptional heat dissipation potential, three key challenges remain. These include nucleate boiling initiation hysteresis, a limited heat transfer coefficient, and low critical heat flux. This study proposes a hierarchical architecture combining a 3-dimensional copper cage for enhanced thermal transport through extended interfaces and preserved vapor pathways, with laser-etched microcavities activating bubble nucleation, along with vertically aligned copper foam rods with superhydrophilic CuO nanocoatings for capillary-driven liquid supply. The synergistic design achieves nearly 8 °C reduction for onset of nucleation boiling, 95 % heat transfer coefficient improvement, and 367.7 W/cm2 in critical heat flux (273 % over plain copper). This tri-level architecture fundamentally resolves the inherent heat transfer coefficient-critical heat flux trade-off by synchronously optimizing nucleation dynamics through microcavity array, phase-change kinetics via the 3-dimensional cage's transport channels, and liquid sustainability through superhydrophilic foam rods' capillary wicking - achieving concurrent enhancement of boiling initiation, heat transfer intensity, and dry-out prevention. The scalable fabrication combining laser processing and electrochemical growth ensures industrial viability. These advancements establish new thermal management benchmarks for high power devices requiring >300 W/cm2 heat flux dissipation.

1. Introduction
The rapid expansion of big data has exponentially increased demand for data centers, which serve as the core computing infrastructure of the digital economy, driving up energy consumption and associated carbon emissions across digital services. In China, data centers consume over 200 billion kWh annually (2.70 % of national electricity demand), with approximately 40 % of this energy dedicated to server cooling [1]. Furthermore, in conjunction with the trend of chip integration and high power in servers [2], the persistent reliance on traditional air cooling systems not only contributes to a significant increase in energy consumption but also leads to diminishing cooling performance. New and retrofitted data centers are increasingly adopting immersion cooling systems, driven by the inherently superior thermal performance of liquids (e.g., dielectric fluorinated fluid) compared to traditional air-cooling methods, achieving higher energy efficiency through significantly improved power usage effectiveness (PUE) [3,4]. This shift is evidenced by several commercial deployments. For example, the BitFury Group implemented an immersion cooling system that achieved a remarkable PUE of 1.02, a drastic improvement from the 1.70 PUE typical of traditional cooling methods [5]. Similarly, Green Revolution Cooling has implemented a micro-modular immersion cooling system at a Hewlett-Packard data center, providing rack cooling of up to 200 kW and achieving an average PUE of 1.03 [6]. Inspur's TS4220LC immersion cooling system also demonstrates exceptional performance, with a reported PUE of 1.03 under high IT power conditions [6]. These cases underscore the commercial viability and superior energy efficiency of immersion cooling as a mainstream solution for modern data centers.
Immersion phase-change cooling surpasses air-cooling's convective limitations by employing direct liquid boiling for thermal regulation [7]. This technology achieves enhanced energy efficiency through latent heat utilization and self-sustaining vapor-liquid cycles, maintaining high heat transfer coefficient (HTC) via optimized bubble dynamics. The two-phase system inherently ensures thermal uniformity across electronic components while providing robust temperature stability absent in conventional cooling approaches. However, beyond the costs associated with server retrofitting and maintenance convenience, fundamental barriers to the development and promotion of this technology lie in the physical mechanisms associated with boiling phase-change technology. These include challenges such as hysteresis of boiling initiation, limited two-phase HTC, and low critical heat flux (CHF). Hysteresis of boiling initiation is defined as the phenomenon in which a liquid, upon reaching its boiling point, fails to exhibit vigorous vaporization due to inadequate nucleation conditions [8]. This phenomenon directly presents the delay of onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) [9], and the energy barrier at the liquid–vapor interface is significant, necessitating a higher surface temperature for effective boiling phase transition, leading to reduced response times of thermal management systems in high power density applications. Limited two-phase HTC indicates low heat transfer efficiency between liquid and solid surfaces, leading to a decline in overall heat exchange performance, potentially causing overheating or performance degradation of the equipment [10]. The CHF marks the thermal limit of nucleate boiling regimes, where reduced values correlate with elevated overheating risks and potential damage to heat transfer surfaces [11,12].
To address these challenges, numerous technological advancements are focused on optimizing surface treatment techniques, including micro/nano structures [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]], surface coatings [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]], and mixed partition architectures [[26], [27], [28]], etc. These explorations are anticipated to significantly enhance the efficiency of immersion phase-change cooling systems, thereby fostering their development across various applications. For example, Thiagarajan et al. [29] adopted high-speed visualization to study bubble dynamics on microporous copper and plain surfaces with HFE-7100. Their results demonstrated that microporous surfaces enhanced CHF by 33–60 % versus plain, with improved HTC. Later, Wen et al. [30] developed a two-level hierarchical surface with copper nanowire arrays, creating microcavities and microvalleys to enhance bubble nucleation and liquid rewetting. Compared to the plain surface, the enhanced surfacey achieved a 71 % higher CHF, improved HTC, and reduced ONB, optimizing boiling performance. Additionally, Saffari et al. [31] employed the WEDM technique to structure copper surfaces with inclined intersected mesochannels for water pool boiling. Their experimental results demonstrated a substantial HTC enhancement of 200 % and achieved a high heat flux of 120 W/cm2 compared to a plain surface. Similarly, Shim et al. [32] improved pool boiling heat transfer by utilizing high aspect ratio aligned silicon nanowires (A-SiNWs), achieving a CHF of 245.6 W/cm2, especially in comparison to conventional random silicon nanowires (R-SiNWs). By creating a hierarchical microstructure of open channels and 300-μm microcavities, Khalaf-Allah et al. [33] achieved a 78.5 % HTC enhancement, attributing this to an optimized density of active nucleation sites. Besides, Sun et al. [34] engineered copper microgrooved surfaces with reentrant cavities via orthogonal P/E, boosting HTC to 38.84 kW/m2K at 20 °C subcooling while reducing ONB superheat to 1.45 °C. Furthermore, Cheitaghy et al. [35] fabricated orthogonally intersecting inclined minichannels on copper via electrical discharge machining (EDM), achieving 170 W/cm2 CHF—an 87 % enhancement over plain copper (91 W/cm2)—with 170 % higher HTC through optimized bubble dynamics. Moreover, Ha et al. [27] enhanced pool boiling heat transfer by fabricating microporous surfaces with vapor channels in both the coatings and substrate, significantly improving the CHF and HTC while controlling vapor layer growth to maintain high HTC under high heat flux conditions. While these singular approaches deliver notable gains in specific issues, they often fall short of achieving simultaneous, holistic enhancement across all critical parameters—ONB, HTC, and CHF—due to inherent design trade-offs. In contrast, hybrid architectures that synergistically combine multiple mechanisms have proven more effective in breaking this performance trade-off [36,37]. For instance, Lim et al. [38] regulated the bubble departure diameter and bubble position by adjusting the size and spacing of hydrophobic patterns on an amphiphilic surface, thereby enhancing CHF. Recently, Haji et al. [39] employed a combined electrospray and photolithography method to fabricate biphilic patterned surfaces. Their experimental results demonstrated a simultaneous enhancement of 130.2 % in the maximum heat flux and 140 % in the HTC for pool boiling of water, compared to a plain copper surface. Overall, despite the significant improvements made by prior research, there remains considerable potential for further simultaneous enhancement of both the CHF and HTC. The primary objective remains the strategic design of hybrid architectures to achieve this simultaneous enhancement for both CHF and HTC.
Inspired by previous exemplary research and to address the identified limitation, we propose a hierarchical micro-nano structured surface with multi-functional synergy to enhance boiling heat transfer performance. The proposed architecture employs a three-dimensional (3D) cage-like copper substrate with fully permeable cavity chambers, which significantly increases the heat transfer area of the solid-liquid interface and enhances the HTC. Additionally, the upper surface incorporates a laser-drilled array that facilitates numerous activated nucleate boiling sites, further reducing the temperature of ONB to nearly 1 °C, approximately 8 °C lower than that of the PS sample. Simultaneously, copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings embedded in the drilled holes significantly enhance the hydrophilicity of the hierarchical surface, enabling it to withstand high wall temperatures under extremely high heat flux conditions. This prevents complete dry-out of the heating surface and significantly enhances the CHF. This tri-level design is engineered to concurrently and significantly improve all three critical performance indicators: drastically reducing the ONB superheat, markedly boosting the HTC, and dramatically elevating the CHF limit. We posit that this synergistic approach effectively breaks the traditional HTC-CHF trade-off, achieving a holistic advancement in boiling heat transfer. This innovative and efficient hierarchical micro-nano surfaces with multi-functional synergy enhancement exemplifiy a unique combination of manufacturing simplicity, low cost, and reliability, with the potential to improve boiling heat transfer performance across a wide range of applications that require high heat flux dissipation.
2. Experimental setup
The pool boiling experimental apparatus, illustrated in Fig. 1, integrates several critical subsystems to facilitate precise thermal tests and two-phase change visualization. The system is centered around a pure copper heating base (10 mm × 10 mm active area) that simulates the thermal characteristics of electronic chips. The heating power from the heating base is generated by seven embedded cylindrical heating rods (100 W for each), controlled by an AC-regulated power supply for adjusting heat input. The test copper sample, chosen for its superior thermal conductivity (∼395 W/(m·K)), was fabricated by computerized numerical control (CNC) machining and assembled upon the copper stem of heating base. To minimize the contact thermal resistance between the interfaces of test sample and heating block, a gallium-based liquid alloy is adopted, that enables better heat transfer performance under high heat flux conditions [27,40]. Multilayer insulation surrounds the heating block to minimize heat loss during high heat flux tests. This insulation combines aluminum oxide ceramic support plates and Micarex plates, with high-temp insulation cotton wrapped around the periphery. The transparent boiling chamber features multiple tempered glass observation panels, and it integrates a serpentine copper condenser connected to a recirculating chiller. The chiller continuously condenses the vapor-phase working fluid (DI-water, Deionized Water) to maintain the system's liquid level. The experimental tests in this study were conducted on the actual platform as shown in Fig. 2.

While the primary 7 cartridge heaters providing the heat source to the test surface sample, another two diagonally positioned auxiliary heaters are immersed in the boiling chamber to regulate the DI-water maintained at saturated state (about 100 °C at 1 atm) by using a temperature proportional integral derivative (PID) control system regulation. Three T-type thermocouples embedded along the thermal path of copper stem collect gradient temperature data (

) to calculate the surface wall temperature (
) by Fourier law, as shown in Eq. (8) later. In addition, boiling two-phase visualization of present study employs a high-speed camera (HuaGu Dynamics, WP-GX050/M) with a high-illumination fill light, synchronized with the data acquisition system (DAQ). The camera was capable of recording at 2000 frames per second at its full resolution of 816 × 624 pixels (0.51 megapixels).
3. Multi-scale hierarchical surface design
3.1. Macro-scale surface substrate
Pure copper is widely recognized for its excellent thermal conductivity (∼395 W/(m·K)), high strength, and stable, reliable performance, making it an ideal substrate for heat transfer applications. However, the smooth surface of copper lacks suitable active nucleation sites necessary for the boiling phase transition. Consequently, in the absence of specialized surface structures, the liquid must absorb a substantial amount of additional heat to accumulate sufficient energy for bubble formation on the surface [41]. Furthermore, the smooth, two-dimensional planar structure of a typical copper surface restricts solid-liquid contact to a single geometric interface, thereby limiting the effective heat transfer area. This restriction facilitates the formation of a thick stagnant boundary layer, concentrating thermal resistance and significantly reducing convective heat transfer efficiency. Thus, the HTC can be enhanced to some extent by increasing the effective contact area between the solid and liquid phases.
This study engineered a 3D caged copper substrate as a foundational platform for micro/nano-scale surface modification. The substrate features a regular array of cavities with a characteristic diameter of 1 mm, uniform spacing of 1 mm, and depth of 1.5 mm. Unlike conventional solid copper, its hollow architecture features interconnected cavities that substantially enlarge the solid-liquid interfacial area with DI-water coolant. These permeable cavities establish 3D pathways for fluid transport and vapor bubble ascent, enabling multidirectional solid-liquid contact that disrupts stagnant boundary layers while facilitating rapid bubble detachment during nucleate boiling [42]. Besides, such an architecture may mitigate localized vapor film blanketing and reduce interfacial thermal resistance. The intrinsic high thermal conductivity of copper, synergized with the cage's 3D conductive network, promotes uniform heat distribution, suppresses hotspot formation, and enhances the overall HTC. Therefore, the present structure can improve heat transfer performance in both single-phase forced convection and nucleate boiling regimes via integrated enlargement of contact area, optimization of fluidic pathways, and enhancement of bubble detachment dynamics. Furthermore, the inherent anti-fouling property of such micro/nano structures helps maintain consistent thermal performance over time, which is crucial for practical applications [43]. The following Fig. 3 illustrates the fabrication process of the copper substrate by CNC machining.

3.2. Micro-scale artificial cavities
The ONB depends on vapor-trapping activation sites where vapor nuclei form [44,45]. This study employs laser etching to fabricate a uniform microcavity array on the surface of the aforementioned 3D caged copper substrate, creating artificial nucleation sites. This configuration increases nucleation site density per unit area, promoting uniform bubble distribution while preventing heat transfer deterioration from localized overheating. According to the classical Hsu's model [46], the optimal diameter for nucleation sites can be estimated using Eq. (1):
(1)
where 
 represents the boundary layer thickness, 
 represents the contact angle of the pure copper surface, 
 represents the saturation temperature, 
 represents the bulk temperature, 
 represents the surface tension, 
 represents the vapor density, and 
 represents the latent heat of vaporization. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the relationship between the range of cavity diameters and the wall superheat and bulk temperature based on Hsu's model. It can be seen that the optimal range for cavity diameter for current test conditions (DI-water, 1 atm) is between 10 μm and 100 μm, thus 60 μm is selected as the target artificial cavity diameter. After that, this study used a nanosecond laser etching system (Raycus Laser, RFL-P30) with a computer vision-assisted positioning system to precisely drill orderly artificial microcavities on the pure copper surface, that enables sub-micron level alignment accuracy, thereby ensuring the precision and positional accuracy of the microcavities, as shown in Fig. 4(b). These artificial microcavities serve as controlled nucleation sites for bubble generation, reducing the difficulty of bubble nucleation and facilitating the ONB occur at lower wall superheat levels.

3.3. Nano-scale coatings integrated on copper foam rods
Most metal oxides demonstrate very low thermal conductivity and present inherent limitations on heat transfer. However, they exhibit significant hydrophilicity and porous surfaces [[47], [48], [49]], providing abundant nucleation sites. To take the advantage of hydrophilic surface property, the present study developed a composite strategy of filling 3D cavities with copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings. This design simultaneously leverages the material's inherent hydrophilicity while offsetting its limitation of thermal conductivity during boiling heat transfer.
To implement this concept, pure copper foams (130 PPI) were selected as the foundational material of porous substrate. Subsequently, laser cutting technology was utilized to meticulously process the copper foam into small rods that correspond to the 3D-caged chamber in the target copper samples. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the preparation process of superhydrophilic foam rods can be delineated into the following steps: Firstly, the copper foam rods were immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid for 10 min, with the cleaning process enhanced by an ultrasonic water bath. After thorough rinsing with water, the copper foam rods were prepared for the chemical deposition of CuO. Later, DI-water was combined with a solution of 2.5 mol/L sodium hydroxide and 0.1 mol/L ammonium persulfate and stirred for 3 min to prepare the CuO nanocoatings solution. Then, the cleaned and dried copper foam rods were immersed in the prepared solution, while the reaction container was kept in a constant temperature water bath at 70 °C for 30 min. The growth mechanism of the CuO nanostructures can be elucidated by the following reactions [50]:

Fig. 5. Fabrication of copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings. The process encompasses laser cutting of the porous substrate, surface activation through HCl cleaning, preparation of the chemical solution, and the final growth of superhydrophilic CuO nanostructures in a controlled 70 °C water bath.

The entire preparation process of superhydrophilic foam rods was conducted under a fume hood to eliminate harmful ammonia gas. Finally, the prepared copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings were removed, thoroughly rinsed with large volumes of water, dried, and embedded into the 3D-caged chamber of the copper samples. Fig. 5 demonstrates the fabrication and assembly of copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings.
The assembly of the hierarchical structure was finalized by embedding the prepared superhydrophilic foam rods into the 3D-caged substrate, as detailed in Fig. 6. This embedding process was performed manually with fine tweezers to ensure careful placement. For future industrial-scale application and mass production, this assembly approach can be readily implemented with automated pick-and-place systems to enable high-throughput manufacturing.

The surface wettability, a critical factor governing boiling performance [51,52], was quantitatively evaluated through static contact angle measurements. As shown in Fig. 7, the pristine PS surface exhibited a hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition with a contact angle of 80°. The PSC sample, featuring a 3D-caged structure with laser-etched microcavities but without nano-coatings, showed a similar contact angle of 81°, indicating that the micro-scale structuring alone did not significantly alter the surface wettability. In dramatic contrast, the multi-scale hierarchical MSH-1.5 surface, integrated with the copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings, demonstrated instantaneous and complete wetting with a contact angle of 2°, defining a superhydrophilic state. This remarkable enhancement in wettability is attributed to the synergistic effect of the micro-scale porous structure of the copper foam and the nanoscale roughness introduced by the CuO coating, which together promote intense capillary action. The superior wettability is pivotal for the rapid liquid replenishment capability discussed in subsequent sections, which directly contributes to the observed CHF enhancement.

Based on the above process, an innovative hybrid microstructured surface that integrates 3D caged chamber with a nanocoated copper foam rod array is successfully developed, aiming to enhance the overall boiling performance. The hybrid enhancement mechanism is expected to operate as follows: the artificial microcavities on the top surface serve as controlled nucleation sites for bubble generation, significantly enhance ONB performance and bubble dynamics. Under high heat flux, localized surface drying risks vapor film formation, the 3D skeletal structure maintains hydraulic pathways and thermal stability during intense evaporation to sustain continuous evaporation-replenishment cycles. Capillary-driven liquid replenishment from copper foam rods with superhydrophilic CuO nanocoatings enables dry-out delay and overheating prevention while facilitating rapid surface rewetting during localized liquid film thinning, thereby enhancing CHF limitation.
Overall, the present study prepared four different samples and conducted comparative boiling experiments to demonstrate their two-phase heat transfer performances, as shown in Fig. 8. All of the four copper substrates were initially fabricated by CNC machining and subsequently polished by 2000# sandpaper. Fig. 8(a) illustrates a pure copper sample with plain surface (PS), which represents a typical smooth surface condition and serves as a reference benchmark in subsequent experiments to highlight the performance advantages of other samples with modified surface structures. It can be seen that there are only scratches from sandpaper on the PS sample, with few micro-pores or cavities. Fig. 8(b) is a 3D-caged sample with artificial microcavity array by laser etching treatment, which is used to verify the improvement of the heat transfer performance of the boiling phase change by the 3D chamber structure and microcavity array. The remaining two specimens, designated MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 in Fig. 8(c) and (d), represent multi-scale hierarchical (MSH) configurations. These were fabricated by machining copper substrates followed by precision laser etching of artificial microcavities on their upper surfaces. Copper foam rods with superhydrophilic CuO nanocoatings were subsequently deposited within the 3D chambers. The nomenclature reflects controlled variations in copper foam rod height (1.5 mm and 2.0 mm) to evaluate height-dependent effects in boiling heat transfer performance.

The samples were designed in this multi-scale hierarchical form with the explicit goal of synergistically addressing the three fundamental limitations of boiling heat transfer simultaneously. The 3D cage structure aims to maximize the heat transfer area and provide vapor escape pathways, the laser-etched microcavities are intended to drastically reduce the superheat required for the ONB, and the superhydrophilic copper foam rods are incorporated to enhance capillary liquid supply and prevent dry-out, thereby significantly boosting the CHF. This integrated architecture was conceived to break the inherent trade-off between a high HTC and a high CHF, achieving concurrent enhancement across all key performance metrics.
4. Testing procedure and data reduction
4.1. Testing procedure
Before each pool boiling experiment, DI-water was continuously boiled for at least 60 min to eliminate the influence of non-condensable gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen). This procedure serves two critical purposes: firstly, it avoids misleading results during high-speed imaging visualization by ensuring that bubble generation originates solely from vapor nucleation rather than the release of dissolved gases, particularly near the ONB; secondly, it minimizes potential alterations in heat transfer performance caused by surface oxidation during prolonged boiling tests, thereby helping to maintain consistent surface properties throughout the experiment. The DI-water temperature was regulated by two auxiliary heating rods submerged in the boiling chamber, controlled by a PID controller. Notably, for the PSC sample and two MSH samples, the edges of the copper substrate were encased in high-temperature adhesive, while the 3D chambers remained exposed to the DI-water to facilitate the liquid replenishment during the boiling tests. Following the commencement of the experiment, the input heating power was incrementally increased by 5–20 W at intervals, with each power level maintained for 10–20 min until a thermal equilibrium was established, characterized by the variations of 
, 
, 
, and 
 within 1 min being less than 0.3 °C. After that, the experimental data was recorded by a DAQ and a computer over 1 min, with all temperature values recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz. Furthermore, a high-speed camera operating at 2000 frames per second was employed to document the boiling two-phase phenomena and bubble evolvement, thus acquiring images of bubble morphology at this heating condition for subsequent analysis. When a sudden and significant increase of copper sample temperature 
 was observed, it was considered as the CHF, and the boiling test was terminated immediately to protect the test sample and heating module from thermal damage.
4.2. Data reduction
The effective heat flux 
 can be calculated from the measured temperature (

The greater distance in the PSC and MSH samples was selected to facilitate the construction of a 3D framework. The corresponding two-phase HTC can be then obtained using Newton's law of cooling as:
(9)
4.3. Uncertainty analysis
The measurement uncertainties in this study primarily arise from temperature measurements, the thermal conductivity of copper, and the distance between adjacent T-type thermocouples inside the copper stem of heating base. Temperature measurements using T-type thermocouples resulted in an uncertainty of ±0.5 °C in the range of 0–125 °C and ±0.4 % in the range of 125–350 °C, respectively. The thermal conductivity of copper was estimated as 395 ± 5 W/(m·K) (or ±1 %). The uncertainty in thermocouple location due to CNC machining errors is ±0.1 mm, as provided by the CNC manufacturer. Therefore, all uncertainties of the main parameters can be calculated using the following equations and listed in Table 1, based on the error propagation law by Kline [59].

5. Results and discussion
5.1. Bubble behaviors
The dynamic behavior of bubbles during boiling heat transfer, encompassing their evolution from generation and growth to coalescence and departure, significantly influences two-phase heat transfer performance [60]. Various surface morphologies can lead to different characteristics of bubble development, while micro/nano structures exhibit microscopic heterogeneities that serve as preferential nucleation sites for bubble formation and decrease the wall superheat required for the ONB. Images captured by high-speed cameras in Fig. 9 illustrate the various two-phase phenomena and bubble behaviors exhibited by four tested samples under specific heat flux conditions, systematically comparing representative sequences of bubble nucleation, growth, and departure characteristics as heat flux increases. This comparative visualization analysis reveals significant morphological differences in the evolution of the vapor-liquid interface between conventional plain surface and modified surfaces, offering mechanistic insights into how micro/nano-scale surface architectures modulate thermal-hydraulic performance during phase change heat transfer.

Fig. 9. Comparative bubble evolvement across a range of heat fluxes. High-speed images show the distinct two-phase phenomena for the (a) PS, (b) PSC, (c) MSH-1.5, and (d) MSH-2.0 surfaces at various heat flux (
) and wall superheat (
) levels.

Fig. 9(a) depicts the bubble evolvement on PS sample with smooth copper surface, when a lower heat flux of 9.2 W/cm2 is applied, only two small bubbles are generated on the heating surface due to the scarcity of active nucleation sites. Consequently, a relatively high wall superheat of 10.2 °C is required to trigger the ONB. As the heat flux increases, more small bubbles are generated then rapidly coalesce together, forming a continuous vapor region on the heating surface that gradually evolves into a vapor film. As can be seen that, this vapor film covers the sample surface for a certain period before rising by buoyance force, inevitably inhibits surrounding liquid rewetting the heating surface and ultimately leads to a rapid increase in surface wall temperature as high as 25.4 °C when dissipating only 98.7 W/cm2, then the CHF limitation is reached, as shown in Supplementary Video-1.
For the PSC sample in Fig. 9(b), ONB occurs significantly earlier at a much lower wall superheat of 3.2 °C under a heat flux of 8.5 W/cm2, representing a 7 °C reduction compared to that of the PS sample. This dramatic enhancement in ONB performance may be attributed to the copper surface featuring large-sized through-hole cavities, which substantially increase the solid-liquid contact area, while the presence of more tiny solid crevices and corners provides additional potential nucleation sites for activated boiling, thereby reducing the superheat required for ONB and resulting in a more efficient phase change during boiling initiation stage. As the heat flux increases, the number of nucleation sites also increases, leading to more bubbles generated on the heating surface. The formation and departure of these small bubbles effectively disturb the liquid boundary layer, thereby enhancing convective heat transfer across the heating surface. The prompt removal of heat delays the formation of the vapor film, enabling the heating surface to withstand higher heat fluxes and thereby possibly increasing CHF. Additionally, more nucleation sites allow the heat to be distributed across multiple locations, preventing excessive local heat concentration. This contributes to maintaining temperature uniformity on the heating surface, thereby reducing the likelihood of premature vapor film formation due to localized overheating. Finally, the PSC sample achieves a high heat flux of 243.4 W/cm2 before CHF is triggered, as can be seen in Supplementary Video-2.
With artificial laser-etched cavities constructed on the top surface of the copper substrate, Fig. 9(c) and (d) clearly demonstrate that the two MSH samples initiate bubble nucleation earlier, producing a greater number of bubbles at wall superheats of 2.5 °C and 2.4 °C, respectively. In current hybrid design, the mixed micro/nano structures, which feature coexisting artificial cavities and copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings, are designed based on the Hsu's model as discussed before. These cavities serve as effective nucleation sites, thus significantly reduce the energy threshold for boiling initiation and reduce wall superheat for ONB. Additionally, the superhydrophilic foam rods contribute synergistically by enhancing liquid rewetting around the artificial cavities, further reducing the ONB threshold. This results in superior boiling start-up characteristics and liquid-vapor transition efficiency compared to that of the PSC sample. Notably, as the heat flux increases, the variations in foam rod height have minor effects on the reduction of wall superheat, indicating that the role of the copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings brings fewer merits in enhancing boiling initiation.
When step into high heat flux region, the two MSH samples exhibit more significant differences compared to the PSC sample. The uniformly distributed artificial cavities provide additional nucleation sites, promoting the formation of more evenly distributed bubbles across the surface. The high-frequency oscillation of these small bubbles enhances turbulence within the thin liquid film region near the interface, thereby increasing the HTC. Furthermore, the superhydrophilicity of MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 facilitates rapid liquid replenishment on the heated surface through capillary action. These characteristics of MSH architecture significantly enhance the high heat flux dissipation capability, exceeding 300 W/cm2. Even when giant bubbles cover the heating surfaces, the superhydrophilic foam rods continuously supply liquid (via wicking effect) to maintain boiling heat transfer, generating small bubbles and preventing local dry-out. Finally, the MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 samples demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving extremely high heat fluxes of 348.9 W/cm2 and 367.7 W/cm2, respectively, before the CHFs are triggered, as shown in Supplementary Video-3. These values represent substantial CHF improvements of 2.53 times and 2.73 times compared to that of the PS sample. Notably, under these high heat flux conditions approaching the CHF limit, the bubbles generated on the MSH samples are significantly larger in volume than those observed on the PS sample. Besides, this remarkably improvement exhibits a clear trend of increasing CHF with greater copper foam rod height. That may be attributed to the higher foam rods' superior ability to store and replenish liquid. Through capillary action, these foam rods more effectively supply liquid to the heated surface under high heat fluxes, thereby preventing surface dry-out, maintaining a stable boiling state, and ultimately enhancing the CHF limitation.
Notably, after prolonged boiling during testing, the copper substrates inevitably oxidized and discolored; however, the CuO-nanocoated copper foam rods remained largely intact, exhibiting minimal changes in properties or appearance. Besides, the mechanical strength of the porous superhydrophilic foam rods is significantly lower than that of pure copper, necessitating caution to avoid mechanical damage during installation and removal.
The observed bubble dynamics provide direct visual evidence of how surface architecture governs the phase-change process. The PS surface, with its scarcity of nucleation sites, forces vapor generation to rely on fewer, larger cavities, leading to the formation of an insulating vapor film at low heat fluxes. In contrast, the PSC sample's 3D cage structure not only provides more nucleation sites but also facilitates liquid replenishment from the sides and bottom of the cavities, thereby delaying the vapor coalescence that triggers CHF. The MSH samples exemplify the synergy between nucleation promotion and liquid supply: the microcavities ensure a high density of small, efficient bubbles that enhance micro-convection, while the superhydrophilic foam rods actively suppress dry-out under these bubbles by wicking liquid to the interface, which is the fundamental reason for their exceptional CHF.
This section elucidates the fundamental role of surface architecture in governing bubble dynamics, which underpins the observed enhancements in boiling performance. The drastic reduction in ONB superheat for micro-structured surfaces (PSC and MSH) is a direct manifestation of the significantly increased nucleation site density. The laser-etched microcavities function as stable vapor traps, effectively reducing the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation as described by classical theory. Furthermore, the 3D cage structure not only augments the heat transfer area but also geometrically confines bubble growth and provides dedicated pathways for vapor escape. This configuration mitigates the lateral coalescence of bubbles that plagues plain surfaces, thereby delaying the formation of an insulating vapor film. Most critically, the integration of superhydrophilic foam rods introduces a powerful capillary wicking force. This force actively counteracts the vapor momentum flux away from the surface at high heat fluxes, which is the primary driver of the hydrodynamic instability leading to CHF. The observed positive correlation between CHF and foam rod height provides strong evidence that the enhanced liquid supply and storage capacity are the dominant mechanisms in preventing dry-out and pushing the heat transfer limit to a new threshold. Thus, the multi-scale design successfully addresses different physical limitations across the boiling curve: nucleation at ONB, convection in the nucleate boiling regime, and hydrodynamic stability at CHF.
5.2. Heat transfer performance
The boiling curves for the four different surface samples are presented in Fig. 10(a), while the corresponding two-phase HTCs as a function of heat flux are shown in Fig. 10(b). Before testing the modified surfaces, a representative PS sample with smooth morphology was evaluated to establish a baseline boiling performance and simultaneously confirm the reliability of the experimental setup. The current experimental results revealed that the boiling performance of the PS samples generally aligns with results reported in other literatures [58,61]. Furthermore, a fitting analysis comparing the experimental data with the classical Rohsenow [62] correlation prediction curve indicated a reasonable consistency between the two. This further supports the accuracy and reliability of the experimental setup in determining the boiling tests, which can provide a foundation for subsequent in-depth studies on the heat transfer performance of other modified samples.

Fig. 10. Comparative boiling performance of the four different surfaces. The boiling curves and corresponding two-phase HTCs demonstrate the synergistic enhancement in key metrics—including ONB, HTC, and CHF—for the PS, PSC, MSH-1.5, and MSH-2.0 samples.

As mentioned earlier, the PS sample exhibits a significant delay in the ONB, requiring a wall superheat of approximately 10.2 °C, due to its smooth surface morphology and the lack of active nucleation sites. In contrast, the PSC samples initiate boiling at a much lower wall superheat of only 3.2 °C. This reduction is attributed to the multiplied solid-liquid interface area provided by their 3D-caged structure and the associated increase in potential nucleation sites. Furthermore, the MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 samples require an even smaller wall superheat of approximately 2 °C to initiate nucleate boiling, representing a reduction of nearly 8 °C compared to that of the PS sample. The series of results clearly demonstrates that, this substantial improvement in ONB performance is primarily attributable to the laser-etched microcavities. These micro-scale cavities create optimal sites for initial bubble formation and effectively lower the energy barrier for nucleation. As the liquid is heated, vapor trapped within the cavities accumulates more readily, forming stable bubble nucleation sites. This mechanism significantly enhances the efficiency and likelihood of boiling nucleation, leading to earlier boiling initiation.
Regarding the two-phase HTC, both MSH samples consistently outperform the PS and PSC samples. The PSC sample achieves a maximum HTC of 62.7 kW/m2K, representing a 62 % increase over the PS sample. This is because the copper substrate samples with 3D cage-like structures allow the liquid to contact a larger surface area, resulting in numerous bubbles forming at different locations within the cage structure. Besides, the maximum HTCs for MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 reach 70.0 kW/m2K and 75.8 kW/m2K, respectively, which are 80 % and 95 % higher than that of the PS sample. This significant enhancement stems primarily from the synergistic interaction between the microcavity array and the superhydrophilic copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings. The cage-like structure significantly increases the effective heat transfer area by expanding the solid-liquid interface through its complex 3D void network. Simultaneously, the copper foam rods with CuO nanocoatings actively wick liquid towards the heated surface, enhancing microscale convective heat transfer. Critically, bubble nucleation inside the perforated chamber induces liquid flow upon detachment more intensively and facilitates contact between the liquid and the foam rods, accelerating liquid replenishment and renewal. The combined effects of increased surface area, enhanced liquid supply via wicking and bubble-induced micro-convection create significant liquid turbulence and augment convective heat transfer. This synergy markedly improves the HTC and enables the samples to maintain efficient heat transfer performance even under high heat flux conditions.
As heat flux increases, the boiling curves of the four surface samples diverge significantly. MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0 demonstrate superior performance, surpassing the PSC sample with more favorable boiling curve trends and enhanced heat transfer characteristics. Furthermore, the 3D hybrid structure of the MSH samples exhibits exceptional resistance to vigorous boiling conditions, maintaining normal boiling phase transitions at extremely high heat flux levels. Consequently, the MSH samples achieved effective heat fluxes of 348.9 W/cm2 (MSH-1.5) and 367.7 W/cm2 (MSH-2.0) before CHF occurrence. However, beyond peak performance at higher heat fluxes, their HTCs gradually decline. This is due to the activation of most nucleation sites and the stabilization of the bubble formation rate have reached an upper limit during the fully developed boiling (FDB) regime under such high heat fluxes. While wall superheat continues to rise, the resulting bubble-induced liquid disturbance reaches a plateau, limiting further convective heat transfer enhancement. Although the copper foam rods with superhydrophilic CuO nanocoatings can mitigate the surface dry-out, the dry-out regions may inevitably expand under extreme heat flux conditions, leading to an overall reduction in HTC and ultimately culminating in CHF.
The divergent trends observed in Fig. 10(b) beyond approximately 200 W/cm2 can be attributed to fundamental differences in the surface structures' ability to maintain liquid supply under high heat flux conditions. For the PSC sample, while the 3D cage structure provides substantial enhancement in heat transfer area, it lacks an integrated liquid replenishment mechanism. Consequently, as heat flux approaches 240 W/cm2, rapid dry-out occurs, leading to an abrupt CHF. In contrast, the MSH samples maintain superior performance through the synergistic action of their multi-scale architecture. The superhydrophilic CuO-nanocoated copper foam rods not only provide additional active nucleation sites but, more critically, enable persistent capillary-driven liquid supply to the heated surface. However, even with this enhanced liquid supply, the gradual expansion of dry areas under extreme heat fluxes eventually limits liquid-solid contact, reducing the effective heat transfer area and causing the observed decline in HTC prior to CHF. This fundamental difference in dry-out resistance explains both the divergent trends beyond 200 W/cm2 and the significantly higher CHF achieved by the MSH surfaces.
The quantitative heat transfer performance data presented in this section provides compelling evidence of the multi-scale surface's efficacy in breaking the inherent trade-off between HTC and CHF. The sequential leftward shift of the boiling curves from PS to PSC to MSH samples directly correlates with the progressive reduction in nucleation energy barrier, achieved by introducing microcavities that serve as stable vapor embryos. The sustained elevation of the HTC curves for the MSH samples underscores a paradigm shift from nucleation-dominated to area-and-convection-dominated enhancement. Here, the 3D cage structure drastically expands the effective heat transfer area, while the superhydrophilic foam rods act as micro-convective promoters by both wicking liquid and facilitating vigorous bubble ejection from within their porous matrix. This synergy creates intense fluid agitation and thin-film evaporation, leading to the remarkable HTC improvement. The convergence of the boiling curves at high superheat for MSH-1.5 and MSH-2.0, alongside their divergent CHF limits, reveals a critical insight: while the fundamental boiling mechanism (e.g., bubble dynamics) may become similar under extreme conditions, the ultimate thermal limit (CHF) is dictated by the capillary-fed liquid supply capacity. The decline in HTC prior to CHF is a signature of the escalating competition between evaporation and wicking, where the formation and expansion of localized dry patches begin to outweigh the convective enhancement, until the capillary supply is fully overwhelmed.
5.3. Multi-functional synergy mechanism
Boiling phase change is governed by complex mechanisms, where evolving bubble dynamics critically govern heat transfer across all regimes, from ONB to CHF. By integrating experimental heat transfer data with synchronized high-speed visualization of bubble dynamics, this study systematically elucidates the fundamental mechanisms behind the heat transfer enhancement of multi-scale hierarchical micro-nano surfaces.
Fig. 11 illustrates the distinct bubble evolution patterns observed for the PS and MSH-2.0 samples under a similar wall superheat of approximately 25 °C. To enhance the visibility of bubbles in the grayscale high-speed images, corresponding bubble distribution contours were traced and overlaid alongside for presentation. These differences in bubble characteristics significantly influence their heat transfer performance. In the FDB regime, both samples exhibit typical bubble development involving nucleation, growth, coalescence and departure. High-speed visualization reveals that under a high heat flux of 98.7 W/cm2, the PS sample tends to generate multiple small, isolated bubbles, as shown in Fig. 11 (a). These bubbles rapidly expand and coalesce into a large vapor blanket within only 6 ms, fully covering the heating surface and preventing surrounding liquid rewetting. In contrast, the MSH-2.0 sample demonstrates notably different bubble behavior. A higher number of much smaller bubbles nucleate across the heating surface, exhibiting a more random spatial distribution. This disparity stems from the stark contrast in nucleation site density between the samples. While the PS sample, with sparse nucleation sites, generates only several discrete bubbles, the MSH-2.0 sample demonstrates a significantly higher density of active nucleation sites due to its increased heat transfer area and engineered microcavities, enabling vigorous formation of numerous smaller bubbles. Despite these differences, the MSH-2.0 sample also forms a complete vapor blanket covering the surface within a comparable timeframe of 6 ms.

Fig. 11. Bubble evolution and synergy mechanism of PS and MSH-2.0 under similar wall superheat: Showing bubble generation, coverage, and departure cycles.

Over time, the vapor blanket formed on the PS sample persists on the heating surface while undergoing continuous expansion, ultimately developing into an exceptionally large vapor volume. Throughout this 65 ms period, liquid beneath the vapor blanket undergoes sustained evaporation, carrying thermal energy away from the heated surface. The bubble maintains this growth phase until achieving sufficient buoyancy for departure. However, this prolonged vapor retention carries significant dry-out risk if liquid replenishment is delayed, with potential for triggering CHF at elevated heat fluxes. In contrast, the MSH-2.0 sample exhibits markedly different behavior. The vapor volume reaches its maximum size in just 26 ms before departure, less than half the duration observed for the PS sample. Notably, the MSH-2.0 achieves a greater maximum bubble volume than the PS sample despite its faster growth cycle. These observations clearly demonstrate the MSH-2.0's superior two-phase heat transfer efficiency, evidenced by both its accelerated bubble dynamics and enhanced vapor volume generation capacity. The remarkable heat transfer enhancement stems from the synergistic effects of the multi-scale hierarchical surface design, which integrates a 3D-caged copper substrate with micro-scale artificial cavities and superhydrophilic nano-coated copper foam rods. As depicted in Fig. 11(b), this innovative architecture simultaneously enhances multiple key mechanisms of boiling heat transfer through carefully engineered interactions. The expanded heat transfer surface containing numerous active nucleation sites promotes vigorous bubble generation while the strategically arranged superhydrophilic foam rods maintain a continuous liquid supply across the entire heating surface, effectively mitigating dry-out risks. Moreover, the deliberate contrast between hydrophobic copper substrate regions and superhydrophilic foam rods induces strong microconvection currents that further intensify the two-phase heat transfer process. These interconnected mechanisms work in concert to create a highly efficient thermal management system where enhanced nucleation, sustained liquid supply, and improved fluid dynamics collectively optimize the boiling performance beyond conventional surface designs.
During the bubble departure stage, the PS sample requires 12 ms for complete detachment of the giant vapor mass before initiating the next generation cycle. In contrast, the MSH-2.0 sample exhibits a prolonged departure duration of 22 ms, attributable to its significantly higher density of active nucleation sites. High-speed visualization reveals critical differences in surface conditions during this phase: while the PS surface experiences near-complete dry-out requiring liquid rewetting, the MSH-2.0's integrated superhydrophilic foam rods maintain continuous liquid retention. These rod structures function as localized liquid reservoirs that sustain evaporation throughout the departure process, forming persistent vapor columns connected to the ascending macro bubble. This continuous vapor generation mechanism explains the extended detachment period observed in the MSH-2.0 sample. Considering complete bubble lifecycles, the PS sample's 83 ms cycle duration substantially exceeds the MSH-2.0's 54 ms period. This 35 % reduction in cycle time, coupled with the MSH-2.0's capacity for larger vapor volumes, demonstrates superior two-phase transition efficiency. Consequently, at equivalent wall superheat of 25 °C, the MSH-2.0 architecture achieves 189.8 W/cm2 heat flux - nearly double the 98.7 W/cm2 maximum attained by the PS sample. The synergistic integration of enhanced nucleation, sustained liquid supply, and optimized departure dynamics collectively enables this significant two-phase heat transfer enhancement.
To provide comprehensive statistical validation of the aforementioned differences in bubble behavior and the heat transfer enhancement mechanisms, Fig. 12 statistically compares the macrobubble departure frequency across four samples with increasing heat flux. The present work calculated the average value of approximately 6–10 bubble rising cycles (depending on heat flux level) of the sample captured within 1 s for statistical analysis, in order to obtain more reliable statistical results. Notably, the PS surface achieves full macrobubble coverage at a relatively low heat flux of 13.9 W/cm2, with a peak departure frequency of 118 Hz. However, this frequency drops to a minimum of 23 Hz when heat flux increases to a maximum limit of 98.7 W/cm2, indicating slow detachment, prolonged surface coverage, and the consequent early triggering of CHF. In contrast, the other three samples do not achieve full macrobubble coverage at this heat flux level. During the full coverage phase, the macrobubble frequency follows the trend: MSH-2.0 > MSH-1.5 > PSC. The superior performance of MSH samples stems from their numerous nucleation sites, which promote dispersed, smaller bubble formation. This continuous generation and detachment of small bubbles effectively suppresses macrobubble coalescence and coverage on the heating surface. Consequently, the reduction in macrobubble detachment frequency with increasing heat flux is relatively slow for MSH samples. Furthermore, the copper foam rods actively wick the surrounding liquid toward the heated surface via strong capillary action. This mechanism not only enables timely rewetting and cooling of incipient dry-out spots to delay the formation of a contiguous vapor film but also fundamentally elevates the CHF [63]. According to the classical force-balance model, CHF is triggered when the vapor momentum force—which acts to push away the liquid and stabilize the vapor film—overcomes the resisting forces, such as surface tension and hydrostatic forces. In the present study, the superhydrophilic copper foam rods introduce an additional capillary wicking force [64]. This augmented resisting force enhances the system's ability to suppress vapor film instability, thereby substantially increasing the CHF limit. Moreover, Fig. 12 demonstrates that as the applied heat flux escalates towards the CHF limit for each sample, the macrobubble departure frequency converges to a similar steady-state value of approximately 20 Hz. This convergence occurs despite the markedly different CHF tolerances of the tested samples. Crucially, within the confined 1 cm2 projected area of the heating surface, the slowed ascent and departure rates of these large bubbles at this limiting frequency ultimately initiate CHF by impeding timely surface rewetting and promoting dry-spot formation.

The present results demonstrate that the hierarchical micro-nano surfaces significantly outperform conventional copper surfaces in key boiling heat transfer metrics: ONB, HTC, and CHF. The unique enhancement mechanisms of these hybrid structures differ from those of traditional enhanced surfaces characterized by uniform surface morphology. MSH samples facilitate the activation of nucleate boiling on the heating surface, which contains distributed cavities, resulting in a significant increase in ONB. Furthermore, the superhydrophilic foam rods continuously absorb the surrounding liquid, while the vigorous boiling bubbles that emerge in the functional area enhance microscale turbulent circulation, further improving heat transfer performance and increasing the HTC. At extremely high heat flux level, even when macro bubbles cover the heating surface, the superhydrophilic foam rods continue to supply water for boiling heat transfer, releasing numerous small bubbles that prevent the heating surface from completely drying out, thereby significantly enhancing the CHF.
While this study demonstrates the significant potential of the hierarchical micro-nano surface in enhancing pool boiling heat transfer, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, the current prototype fabrication relied on manual assembly for embedding the superhydrophilic foam rods into the 3D substrate, a process which may introduce minor dimensional variations and poses a challenge for consistent large-scale manufacturing. Future work should focus on developing automated and standardized fabrication techniques to ensure reproducibility and scalability for industrial applications. Secondly, the analysis of bubble dynamics was primarily focused on departure frequency to confirm the overall enhancement. A more profound understanding of the underlying phenomenology—such as detailed bubble nucleation, growth rates, volume evolution, and the complex force interactions during coalescence and ascent—was limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the current high-speed visualization system. A comprehensive investigation of these intricate phenomena would require advanced optical diagnostics (e.g., higher-speed photography, particle image velocimetry) and is planned as a key objective for subsequent research to further elucidate the fundamental mechanisms.
Fig. 13 presents a comparative analysis of two-phase boiling heat transfer performance for various surface structures fabricated on identical pure copper substrates using deionized water under atmospheric pressure, based on experimental data reported in recent literatures, including graphene oxide nanocoating [65], microtube arrays [66], ZnO nanowire surfaces [67], spontaneously grown boehmite nanostructures on aluminum surfaces [68], porous coating surfaces [69], microporous copper over CuO film surface [70]. Current surface enhancement techniques generally exhibit CHFs below 250 W/cm2, with maximum two-phase HTCs typically ranging between 50 and 100 kW/m2K. In contrast, the hybrid micro/nano-structured matrix array developed in this work demonstrates significantly enhanced boiling performance, attaining a remarkable CHF of 367.7 W/cm2. Furthermore, this configuration maintains maximum HTC values of 60–80 kW/m2K in the FDB regime.

This section conclusively demonstrates that the multi-scale hierarchical surface orchestrates a fundamental shift in boiling dynamics by synergistically managing vapor and liquid pathways. The experimental evidence confirms that the MSH-2.0 surface, compared to the PS surface under identical wall superheat, achieves a much higher heat flux due to its drastically shortened bubble lifecycle and enhanced vapor generation capacity. This performance stems from the concurrent enhancement of three key mechanisms: the engineered microcavities ensure dense and uniform nucleation, the 3D cage structure facilitates vapor escape and mitigates lateral coalescence, while the superhydrophilic foam rods provide continuous capillary-driven liquid supply. The statistical data on macrobubble departure frequency further validates that this integrated design effectively suppresses vapor film coverage over a wide heat flux range, thereby postponing the hydrodynamic limit to a significantly higher CHF. The convergence of departure frequency near CHF for all samples underscores a universal limiting condition, where vapor release becomes the rate-limiting step. Ultimately, the synergy within the MSH architecture successfully breaks the traditional trade-off by simultaneously optimizing nucleation, convection, and liquid replenishment.
6. Conclusions
This study successfully developed a multi-scale hierarchical surface architecture that achieves a synergistic breakthrough in pool boiling heat transfer by integrating a three-dimensional copper cage, a laser-etched microcavity array, and superhydrophilic CuO-nanocoated copper foam rods. The experimental results conclusively demonstrate that this hybrid design effectively overcomes the traditional performance trade-off between the HTC and the CHF, thereby addressing a fundamental challenge in the field.
The hierarchical surface induces a profound reduction in the superheat required for boiling initiation, lowering the ONB to merely 2.4 °C—a dramatic 8 °C decrease from the 10.4 °C required by the plain surface. This early activation can be attributable to the laser-etched microcavities, which serve as abundant and stable nucleation sites. Furthermore, the architecture drives a remarkable enhancement in heat transfer efficiency, achieving a maximum HTC of 75.8 kW/m2K for the MSH-2.0 sample. This represents a 95 % improvement over the plain surface and also surpasses the performance of the micro-structured surface without nano-coatings. Most notably, the design enables a breakthrough thermal limit, elevating the CHF to an exceptional 367.7 W/cm2. This value is 273 % higher than that of the plain surface and establishes a new benchmark for surface-based enhancement techniques.
The significance of these results lies in the synergistic mechanism through which the MSH surface simultaneously optimizes bubble nucleation, micro-convection, and liquid supply. The 3D cage structure amplifies the heat transfer area and organizes vapor escape, the microcavities govern the boiling incipience, and the superhydrophilic foam rods provide a powerful, capillary-driven liquid supply that prevents dry-out under extreme heat fluxes. This multi-functional synergy directly addresses the research gap identified in prior works, which often improved one parameter at the expense of another. By reconciling these competing objectives, our work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for next-generation thermal management, demonstrating viable performance for dissipating heat fluxes exceeding 300 W/cm2 in high-power-density electronic systems.
