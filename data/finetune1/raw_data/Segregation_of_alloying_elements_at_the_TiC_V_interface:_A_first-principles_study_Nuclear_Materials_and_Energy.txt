Abstract
For precipitation/matrix coherent interface, the interfacial segregation behavior of solute atom plays a vital role in controlling the effectiveness of precipitation strengthening of the alloy. In this study, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory are used to figure out the interfacial structure of precipitates/vanadium and explain how solute atoms segregate at the interface and affect the interfacial strengthening. Firstly, according to the Baker-Nutting orientation relationship, the equilibrium interface structures are obtained. Meanwhiles, the segregation behavior of solute atoms at the different interfaces in vanadium alloys was studied. It is found that elements Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Hf, and Ta, in the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, tend to segregate at the interface, while other ones are not easy to segregate. The alloy elements show the same segregation trend as the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, except for Nb, which also tends to segregate at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface. According to the calculation, it is found that the alloying element with the larger atomic size and Voronoi volume is more likely to segregate into the interface, indicating that the atomic size effect dominates alloying element segregation at the two interfaces. The findings of this work can be used to develop theoretical approaches for future alloy designs by controlling alloying element doping.

1. Introduction
The vanadium (V) alloy with excellent mechanical properties [1], [2], thermophysical properties, low activation [3], [4], compatibility with lithium and other coolant materials [5], [6], and good radiation embrittlement resistance is regarded as a blanket construction material in nuclear fusion [7], [8]. It is intended to demonstrate the DEMO tritium breeder blanket technology as the test blanket module (TBM) of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [9], [10], [11]. Undoubtedly, the composition and microstructure of vanadium alloys are optimized by adding solute atoms to improve their mechanical properties [12]. However, the situation is more complicated with multivariate alloys, where the Ti addition in the V-4Ti-4Cr alloy decreases the void expansion during neutron irradiation and the Cr addition enhances the mechanical characteristics of vanadium alloys at high temperatures [13]. Meanwhiles, It is well known that interstitial impurities such as C, O, and N in V-4Cr-4Ti alloys play an important role in irradiation effects, such as irradiation hardening, microstructural changes, and embedding [14], [15], [16].
Under specific working conditions, prolonged thermal radiation exposure of V-4Cr-4Ti alloys causes significant changes in the microstructure of the precipitates, including their size, shape, and density, and these factors greatly affect the precipitation strengthening of V-4Cr-4Ti alloys, which affects the mechanical properties of the alloys and thus the service life of the blankets [17], [18].Experimental studies have shown that the high density of fine precipitates in the matrix and the pinning effect between them and dislocations prevent the sliding and climbing of precipitates, which improves the mechanical strength of V alloys [19]. Vanadium alloys are sensitive to low-temperature embrittlement under neutron irradiation, limiting their application at low temperatures (400 °C), which is probably related to the Ti(CNO) precipitation phase that occurs in V-4Cr-4Ti alloys under heat treatment [20]. In addition, at high temperatures, precipitates in the matrix dissolve, hardening the solid solution and reducing its resistance to IR expansion and mechanical characteristics [21]. For instance, Ti-rich precipitates formed and the alloy's hardness decreased after 1 h of aging at 1273 K [22], during the solution treatment at 1173 K, the Ti(CNO) precipitates dissolved and softened the matrix.
According to recent researches, dispersion strengthening can strengthen materials by adding Y, which can enhance their mechanical properties [16], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. It was discovered that the alloying elements in vanadium-based alloys undergo segregation during alloy manufacturing and neutron irradiation, and Y is more likely to combine with O [28]. Subsequently, Zhang et al. provided a more precise explanation in their study, demonstrating that the addition of a small amount of Y can effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen atoms in the matrix and inhibit the growth of Ti-rich precipitates [29]. Recently, Luo et al. study the effect of Y content on microstructure and irradiation behaviors of V alloys and found that the addition of Y element not only can refine the grains size, but also inhibit the formation of voids and reduce the size of radiation-induced dislocation loops [30]. Similar results had been observed in the research of Zhang et al.[31]. In addition to the formation of Y-rich oxides, the addition of Y also leads to the formation of Ti-rich shells coated with Y-rich particles, proving that the addition of Y in the V-4Cr-4Ti alloy affects Ti segregation [32]. This may be reasonably explained by first-principles calculations, namely, that there is an apparent attractive interaction between Ti and Y in the V bulk [33]. According to the study of Zhang et al.[34], the doping of alloying elements can change the structure of the V matrix/precipitated phase interface and affect its precipitation strengthening effect, which in turn affects the mechanical properties of the alloy. Therefore, understanding the segregation behavior of alloying elements at the precipitated/V matrix interface is important to reveal the coarsening and growth of the precipitated phase as well as the precipitation strengthening effect.
In this paper, the segregation behavior of solute atom transition element doping on different TiC/V interfaces is thoroughly studied using the density functional theory method. In addition, the relationship between segregation energy and atomic size is also explored, and its correlation is discussed from the perspective of electronic structure, revealing the factors that influence the segregation of atomic solutes.
2. Computational methods
2.1. First-principles methodology
The Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [35], [36] and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [37], [38] and the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [39], [40] of Perdew-Burke-Emzerhof (PBE) [41] were used to apply the first-principles calculations. An energy cutoff of 450 eV resulted in the relaxation of all structures. The convergence criteria of the atoms in the unit cells were fully relaxed, and the relaxation accuracy was set as 1.0 × 10-5 eV/atom. The ionic Hellmann-Feynman force converges to 0.02 eV/Å at its greatest value. With a Monkhorst-Pack [42] K-point grid, the Brillouin zone is sampled. This work investigates three low-index coherent interfaces: TiC/V(1 0 0), TiC/V TiC/V(1 1 0), and TiC/V(1 1 1). The corresponding Monkhorst-Pack K-point meshes were 4 × 4 × 1, 6 × 4 × 1, and 2 × 2 × 1, for the three interfaces' supercells, which have 92, 56, and 255 atoms, respectively. Convergence tests were performed out for the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) surface slabs, respectively, to determine the appropriate number of atomic layers of V and TiC slabs for the construction of interfaces. In the direction perpendicular to the surface, a vacuum layer of 15 Å thick was introduced to avoid interactions between surface atoms, and Monkhorst k-point meshes of 6 × 6 × 1, 7 × 7 × 1 and 7 × 7 × 1 were used for (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) surface slabs, respectively. For the Baker-Nutting orientation relationship, the lattice misfit between the precipitate and V matrix can be estimated as follows:
(1)
Where 
 is the lattice constant of the precipitated phase corresponding to the different directions, and 
 is the lattice constant of the V matrix.
The heterogeneous nucleation process has the highest efficiency at 6% for nucleation, according to Bramfitt misfit theory [43]. The orientation relations in this study demonstrate that the misfit between the surfaces of TiC(1 0 0) and V(1 0 0), TiC(1 1 0) and V(1 1 0), and TiC(1 1 1) and V(1 1 1), respectively, is 2.20%, 2.21%, and 3.79%. TiC is the most effective heterogeneous V nucleation, as shown by the lattice misfit (
) of coherent interfacial precipitation in the V matrix being less than 6%.
2.2. Formation energy
The formation energy 
 of carbides is the energy released (or absorbed) by atoms during the formation of carbides from a single state, and the formula is as follows:
(2)
Where: 
 is the total energy of the unit cell of the metal carbide; 
 and 
 are the number of metal atoms and carbon atoms, respectively; 
 and 
 are the average atomic energy of metal and graphite, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk properties and building TiC/V interface model
3.1.1. Bulk calculations
Firstly, the calculations made for the bulk of pure vanadium and TiC were finished, and the relaxed crystal lattices are subsequently used to create interface models for a coherent TiC/V interface. Table 1 includes the previously expected theoretical data along with the computed lattice characteristics and formation energies. The comparison in Table 1 demonstrates that the obtained results are in good agreement with the reported results [44], [45].

The site preference of the solute elements is determined by the defect formation energy. Previous research has calculated the corresponding formation energies, which indicates that all solute elements prefer the Ti-site [47].
According to previous research, the metal-on-nonmetal configuration has the lowest interfacial energy at the metal/ceramics interface as demonstrated by the Baker-Nutting orientation relationship between the precipitations and the V matrix [48]. To create a reasonable interface, the B1-TiC/bcc-V interface heterostructure models are constructed. To build the TiC/V interface, the two slabs that make up the interface must be thick enough to show the bulk-like interiors. Therefore, convergence tests were carried out on V and TiC slabs, and the relaxation of V and TiC surfaces with slab thickness was studied to determine the appropriate number of atomic layers. Considering the non-stoichiometry of the TiC(1 1 1) surface, the slab is a polar surface with two distinct terminations, Ti- and C-terminated surfaces, respectively.
Table 2, Table 3 show the change in interlayer spacing for bcc-V and TiC surface relaxation with termination and slab thickness, with the percentage relaxation of the interlayer distance calculated according to Ref.[49].

Where

 th and 
 th atomic layers, and 
 is the corresponding interlayer distance in the bulk. The positive sign of 
 corresponds to the expansion of interlayer spacing, while the negative sign means contraction.
The relaxation of the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces of bulk V and TiC, and the Ti-terminals of TiC(1 1 1) surface is primarily concentrated in the top three atomic layers, whereas the relaxation of the C-terminals of TiC(1 1 1) surface is primarily concentrated in the top four atomic layers, as can be seen from Table 2, Table 3. The interlayer relaxations are also discovered to have converged when the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) of TiC and the Ti-terminals of TiC(1 1 1) slabs have more than 7 atomic layers, whereas the C-terminals of TiC(1 1 1) have 9 layers. Therefore, the 7-layer structure of (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) slabs for V, TiC, and Ti-Terminal of TiC and the 9-layer structure of (1 1 1) slabs for V and C-Terminal of TiC are employed to construct the respective interfaces in the interface correlation calculation follows.
3.1.2. The TiC/V interface model
Lattice mismatch has an important effect on the interface coherence and coarsening of the precipitation. The interfaces conforming to the lattice mismatch include TiC/V(1 0 0), TiC/V(1 1 0), and TiC/V(1 1 1) with Eq. (1) is satisfied and the lattice mismatch (ε) between the V matrix and the precipitation is less than 6%. Under the condition that the V matrix, the interface model of the precipitation, the interlayer relaxation convergence, and the lattice mismatch of less than 6% conditions are all met, the interface model that considers different stacking positions of the interface is illustrated in Fig. 1. However, the TiC/V(1 1 1) interface model (f-g) has 225 and 193 atoms, respectively, which is an excessive number to ensure the accuracy of the results in the subsequent interface computation. As a result, this work does not explore the TiC/V(1 1 1) interfaces.

3.2. Interfacial properties
3.2.1. Work of adhesion
We can use 
 to express the mechanical properties of the TiC/V interfaces. The work of adhesion (
) is calculated as [50], [51], [52].
(4)
where 
 denotes the total energy of the fully relaxed slabs, 
 denotes the total energy of 
 interface system, 
 represents the area of the interface model. The 
 and equilibrium interface distance (
) of the fully relaxed models are listed in Table 4.
Table 4. Interfacial separation (
), adhesion work (
), and interface energy (γint) of fully relaxed models.

TiC/V(1 1 0)	Ti-top site	D	1.906	3.987	2.036
C-top site	E	1.416	4.909	1.073
For TiC/V(1 0 0) models, Model A has the largest 
 and the smallest equilibrium interface separation (
), followed by Model B and Model C, whereas Model C is unstable because of the significant distortion. Thus, among the three TiC/V(1 0 0) models, TiC/V(1 0 0) Model A stacked at the C-Top site exhibits the highest adhesion strength and interface binding as well as being the most stable one. Similarly, according to 
 and equilibrium interface separation (
), Model D has a smaller 
 and larger 
 than Model E, which has the strongest adhesion strength and interface binding, and is the most stable of the TiC/V(1 1 0) model.
3.2.2. Interfacial energy
The interfacial energies for the coherent TiC-precipitate/V interface are calculated according to Ref.[48]
(5)
Where 
 is the total energy of the TiC/V interface system,
 represents the area of the interface model, and 
 denotes the energy of the V lattice, and 
 is the total energy of the TiC at the equilibrium state. N and M are the corresponding numbers of lattice sites of V and TiC precipitations in the supercell, respectively. The interface energies of the five models are listed in Table 4. It shows that the C-top site TiC/V(1 0 0) interface (Model A) has the smallest 
 (0.155 J/m2), followed by the Ti-top site interface (0.260 J/m2). Therefore, among the three TiC/V(1 0 0) models, the center-sited model (Model A) is the most stable one, which is consistent with the results obtained from 
 and 
. In the TiC/V(1 1 0) two interfaces, the C-top site (Model E) has the smallest 
(1.073 J/m2), and that of the Ti-top site is 3.036 J/m2. The C-top site (Model E) is the most stable model, which is consistent with the results obtained by 
 and 
. Therefore, based on the results of the previous discussion of surface convergence and stability, TiC/V(1 0 0) and TiC/V(1 1 0) interfaces, respectively, select Model A and Model E to construct corresponding TiC/bcc-V interfaces to study the segregation behavior of alloy elements at the interface.
3.2.3. Segregation behavior of alloying elements
According to the previous discussion, the TiC/V(1 0 0) Model A and the TiC/V(1 1 0) Model E is determined as the theoretical models for the subsequent exploration of the segregation trend of alloying elements at the interface. By introducing a solute atom to replace the atoms in Vb, Vi (i = 1,2,3,4), and Ti1 sites, the segregation behavior of alloying elements in the interface is explored, as shown in Fig. 2. For the TiC side of the interface, Sc, Cr, Y, Fe, Tc, Co, Hf, Ta, and other 3d, 4d, and 5d transition elements occupy the Ti site according to the results of site preference discussed above. Assuming that the Vb atomic layer is far enough from the interface, it can be considered a ‘bulk’ site. The segregation energy of a solute atom in the interface refers to the difference between the formation energies of the configurations within the solute atom at the sites of Vi or Tib, respectively, and that of the configuration within the same solute atom in the bulk region of V (site Vb):

According to this expression, a negative value for the segregation energy indicates that the solute atom prefers the position, and a positive value indicates that the position is energy unfavorable.
The calculated segregation energies of alloying elements of each transition element at two low-refractive index interfaces of TiC/V are shown in Fig. 3. At the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, it has been observed that Zr, Hf, and Ta have a propensity to segregate towards the TiC side of the interface (Ti1 site), whereas Sc, Y, and Ti have a tendency to segregate towards the V side of the interface (V1 site). Transition metal elements such as Mn, Nb, W, Cr, Co, and others have a tendency to remain in the V bulk phase. Similarly, at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, it has been found that Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta tend to segregate towards the V side of the interface (V1 site), whereas Cr, Mn, W, Co, and other transition metal elements tend to remain in the V bulk phase. After combining the results of the segregation energy calculations mentioned above, it can be concluded that the segregation behavior of the alloying elements is similar for the TiC/V(1 0 0) and TiC/V(1 1 0) interfaces. Specifically, the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal elements, including Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Hf, and Ta, tend to segregate towards both interfaces, while Nb only exhibits segregation at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface and the other transition metal elements are less prone to segregation at the interface.

In each plot, the difference between the formation energies of different alloying elements (Ti1, V1, V2, V3, V4, and Vb) is calculated, indicating the segregation energies of alloying elements at the Vb, Vi, and Ti1 sites on the TiC side, that is, the segregation energies of different alloying elements at different sites.

3.2.4. Influence of alloying elements segregation on the interfacial strength
To investigate the influence of the segregation behavior of alloying elements on the interfacial strength, The 
 was calculated. Fig. 4 illustrates the 
 of the pure TiC/V interface and the doped interface. The addition of alloying elements causes the V/TiC(1 0 0) interface the decrease in 
 for Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Hf, and Ta doping. The addition of Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ta results in an increase in the interfacial 
 at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, whereas the segregation of Sc, Y, and Zr results in a decrease. This indicates that the interface doped with Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ta is favorable for improving the interfacial rupture strength of the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, while adding Sc, Y, and Zr has the opposite effect. In addition, it was discovered that 
 was the smallest in both interfaces after doping Y, indicating that Y weaken the interface strength. The cause of this maybe is that Y solute present a weak interaction with the nearest neighboring V atoms [53].

 of the pure TiC/V interface, 
 of the TiC/V(1 0 0), and TiC/V(1 1 0) corresponding segregation alloying elements after segregation to the interface, respectively.

To analyze the mechanism of elemental segregation, we calculated the Voronoi volumes of different sites in the pure and doped interface, as shown in Table 5, Table 6. In both interfaces, the Voronoi volumes of Ti1 and V1 are larger than those of other sites, particularly for the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface. The reason for this is that the atomic spacing at the interface is significantly larger and the distortion at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface is greater than the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface. In addition, the bulk formation energies of ScC, TiC, VC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, and TiC were computed using Eq. (2), and the corresponding calculations and reference data are summarized in Table 7. In both interfaces, the Voronoi volume of the site is significantly reduced after Hf addition, and the formation energy of HfC (-91.13 KJ/mol) is lower than that of the precipitated phase TiC (-79.05 KJ/mol). The Voronoi volume of Hf is significantly reduced due to the obvious interaction with the nearest neighboring C atoms. For the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, Ti, Sc, and Y tend to segregate on the V side, preferentially to the V1 site with the larger Voronoi volume. Although the Voronoi volume of Ti1 is slightly smaller than that of V1, the solutes Zr and Hf are still segregated at the the Ti1 site. This is because ZrC and HfC have lower formation energies than TiC and are therefore more likely to occupy the Ti1 site. Ta is more readily segregated to the Ti1 site even though the formation energy of TaC (-57.46 KJ/mol) is higher than that of TiC (-79.05 KJ/mol). This is because Ta prefers to segregate to Ti1 sites with larger Voronoi volumes. However, the Voronoi volume of V1 at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface is much larger than that of Ti1, so the alloying element is more likely to segregate to the V1 site, even though the formation energies of HfC and ZrC are lower than that of TiC.

3.2.6. Correlation between alloy elements segregation and atomic size/volume at TiC/V interface
Based on the calculations and analysis in the previous section, we obtained that the atomic size is crucial for the segregation behavior of the solute between the precipitating phase and the V matrix. Therefore, to gain insight into the effect of atomic size on the segregation behavior, we next performed a study of the relationship between the DFT solute segregation energy and the atomic descriptors. Fig. 5 shows the linear relationship between the solute segregation energy and the chosen descriptors, although several outliers do not follow this trend.

Fig. 5. Relationships between molar volume, atomic radius, DFT solute volume in V, and alloying element segregation energy at the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface; the relationship between molar volume, atomic radius, and DFT solute volume in V, and the relationship between molar volume, and alloying element segregation energy at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface. The DFT solute volume of V itself is treated as zero, and the vertical lines represent the values of V, respectively.

The solute atom tends to segregate more towards the interface when the size/volume of the atom is greater than vanadium, but transition metal elements of the same period are more likely to stay in the vanadium bulk phase as the atomic radius decreases. On the other hand, the tendency to segregate is more pronounced when the solute size is close to the vanadium atom. After discussion and analysis, it is demonstrated that the solute segregation behavior at the coherent interface is highly correlated with the descriptors related to size and volume (atomic radius, atomic volume, DFT solute volume).
3.3. Electronic properties
In order to better understand the segregation behavior of alloying elements, the bonding characteristics between the alloying elements and the neighboring atoms at the interface were investigated. The charge density maps of various alloying elements that are undoped and doped are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, respectively, at the Ti1, V1, and V2 sites at the TiC/V(1 0 0) and TiC/V(1 1 0) interfaces. In particular, Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the charge density at the pure TiC/V(1 0 0) interface at the V1 and Ti1 sites. The charge densities of the Sc, Ti, and Y at the V1 site and Ta at the Ti1 site are shown in Fig. 6(c)-(f). In comparison to the pure TiC/V interface, the charge density between the alloying elements and surrounding atoms becomes sparser, and the bonds are broken. Of them, the Y element occupying the V1 site results in the most notable modification of charge density close to the interface. This is consistent with the finding in section 3.2.3 that the element Y weakens the stability of the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface. It is apparent from the charge distribution in Fig. 6(f) that the charge density decreases and the bonding between the interfaces weakens.

The alloying elements Hf, Ti, Y, and Ta are all segregated to the V1 site for the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, which is the largest Voronoi volume site. Fig. 7(a) shows the charge density of the pure TiC/V(1 1 0) interface at the V1 site. The charge density of Hf at the V1 and V2 sites are shown in Fig. 7(c) and (f), respectively. The charge density of Ta, Hf, and Ti at the V1 site is found to be higher than that at the V1 site of the pure TiC/V(1 1 0) interface in Fig. 7(a), (b), (c), and (d), and the interface becomes more stable after Hf segregates at the V1 site. This is consistent with the findings in section 3.2.3, which show that the 
 of the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface increases after Hf, Ti, and Ta are doped at the V1 site. Because the V1 site has the biggest Voronoi volume, which is better for the segregation of alloying elements.
4. Conclusions
This study aims to characterize the segregation behavior of alloy elements at the heterostructure precipitate/vanadium interface in vanadium alloys. We calculated the segregation tendency of 21 common transition substitutional alloying elements at the TiC/V interface through the first-principles calculations.
First, the layer number convergence test, lattice mismatch, interfacial spacing, work of separation, and interfacial energy were calculated and compared with experimental and theoretical work in the literature. Models A and E of the TiC/V interface, which is equilibrium stable precipitate/V matrix interface structures, were developed based on the Baker-Nutting orientation relationship. Second, In the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, it has been found that the elements Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Hf, and Ta tend to segregate at the interface while other elements are more difficult to segregate. As for the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, the alloy elements show the same segregation trend as the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface except for the element Nb also tends to segregate at the interface. Furthermore, by computing the interfacial separation work (
), it is discovered that at the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, element Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Hf, and Ta decreases the interfacial strength. As for TiC/V(1 1 0) interface, Sc, Y, and Zr decrease the interfacial stability, whereas Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ta increase the adhesion of the interface. In addition, since the Voronoi volume at the TiC/V(1 1 0) interface is larger than that at the TiC/V(1 0 0) interface, alloy elements with larger atomic sizes are more likely to segregate to the site with a larger Voronoi volume, and the same alloy elements have a more obvious tendency to segregate at the TiC/V(1 1 0) and are more likely to stay at the V side. Besides, we found that there is a linear correlation between the segregation energy of different transition elements at the coherent interface and the atomic radius, atomic volume, DFT solute volume, and alloy element segregation energy. The tendency of alloy elements to segregate at the two interfaces is dominated by the size effect of the atoms. Finally, the charge densities at the TiC/V(1 0 0) and TiC/V(1 1 0) interfaces were calculated, and the tendency of alloy elements to deflect at both interfaces is dominated by the size effect (physical contribution) of the atoms, which is consistent with our previously DFT calculated results.
