Abstract
Tunnels in cold regions will encounter serious frost damage during operation. Based on the Tongsheng Tunnel, an unsteady heat transfer model of surrounding rock, tunnel lining, and wind flow was established. The numerical method was verified by a field test. The effects and sensitivity of airflow factors on the tunnel temperature field were studied, especially the freezing depth (XF) and heat-adjusting depth (XH). Then a BP neural network was developed and trained to predict tunnel freezing conditions. The results show that: (1). XF and XH are negatively correlated with T (average air temperature in winter) at the same position and positively correlated with S (average wind speed in winter). However, the relationship between XF, XH and D (dominant wind direction in winter) is related to L (distance from the entrance). XF and XH are positively correlated with D when L is less than 150 m, but negatively correlated with D when L exceeds 150 m. (2). The order of sensitivity to the effect of the tunnel temperature field is T > S > D. (3) The tunnel direction should be avoided parallel to the wind direction, and should be intersected perpendicular to the wind direction or at a large angle as much as possible. (4). Finally, by neural network, using T, S, D, and L to predict XF and XH of the tunnel arch bottom is feasible and efficient. Consequently, the BP neural network is capable of predicting the freezing damage location in tunnels in a convenient and efficient way.

Introduction
Tunnels in high-latitude cold regions are always plagued by frost damage in winter because of the extreme cold temperatures they are exposed to. It is reported that 80% of tunnels in cold areas have suffered freezing damage [1]. Especially in the northeast of China, there is a strong heat exchange between tunnel lining and air, resulting in cracking of tunnel structure, leakage, and blockage of drainage pipes [2]. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of the temperature field of tunnels in cold regions under the influence of airflow and predict the location of freezing damage as well as carry out scientific prevention.
Up to now, some theoretical studies have been conducted on temperature fields in tunnels in cold regions. Jain et al. [3] obtained the analytical solution of the transient temperature field of the circular cross-section under the convective boundary condition considering the change of temperature with coordinate by using the superposition principle and the separation variable method. Krarti, Kreider et al. [4] found the analytical solution of the tunnel air temperature field based on the principle of conservation of energy and derived the annual average temperature and the annual temperature amplitude. Tan et al. [5] discussed the influence of ventilation on the temperature field of the Kalongla Tunnel in Tibet but did not consider the wind direction. Zhang et al. [6] established a composite heat transfer model of the tunnel with the TPCT group, which included the air turbulent heat transfer inside the tunnel, the air-TPCT-soil coupled heat transfer for the TPCT group, and heat conduction with phase change in the soil layers and tunnel structure layers. Zhang et al. [7] conducted field tests of thermal response considering ventilation in the Linchang Tunnel. And a 3D numerical model of tunnel lining GHEs was established and verified with the field monitoring data. Lu et al. [8] obtained the temperature field of the tunnel in cold regions by numerical simulation and developed four formulas to consider the effects of airflow velocity, initial temperature, volumetric specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity on the temperature of the surrounding rock. Tan et al. [9] established a two-dimensional numerical model of the tunnel cross-section. The influence of airflow on the temperature field of the tunnel in cold regions has been emphatically studied, but the influence of wind temperature, wind speed, and wind direction has not been comprehensively considered.
In addition, Liu et al. [10] established a tunnel model with a similarity ratio of 1:37. The distribution of temperature fields under different temperatures and wind speeds was studied. Based on the actual horseshoe tunnel section, Zeng et al. [2] conducted a similar simulation model test with a geometric ratio of 1:30 to study the coupled effect of convection-conduction with low inlet temperature airflow. Zhang et al. [11] conducted model tests to evaluate the heat transfer potential of energy tunnels with an insulation layer under ventilation and groundwater seepage. Zhao et al. [12] conducted a comprehensive measurement of the air temperature in the Zuomutai Tunnel in China, which showed that the air temperature at the vault of the tunnel is generally higher than that at the waist and side walls in winter, especially near the dominant airflow outlet. Jun et al. [13] investigated the internal temperature distribution in winter in a tunnel located in Gangwon province, the coldest area in Korea. Zhao et al. [14] conducted temperature measurements in the Xing'anling Tunnel in northeast China from 2016 to 2019 and studied the spatiotemporal characteristics of the temperature field.
The movement of the trains also affects the temperature field of the tunnels in the cold region. The main factors include the piston action of trains and the assimilation of heat in a tunnel by a cold train.
The effect of train piston action is closely related to the external air temperature, tunnel type, train density and train speed [15], [16], [17], [18]. In the research of Kiyanitsa et al. [19], the train piston action effect is more significant in the tunnel with larger blocking rate and lower external air temperature. Some studies have found that the greater the train density and speed, the longer the tunnel freezing length, but the effect of speed is limited [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. In addition, Lugin et al. [25] considered the assimilation of heat in a tunnel by a cold train in the study of heat exchange between trains and air in cold seasons. Kiyanitsa et al. [26] considered the influence of cold trains in the study of providing temperature for extended transport tunnels of the Baikal-Amur Railway. In the case of extreme low temperature, large blocking ratio and high train density, the role of trains cannot be ignored, but in some tunnels its impact seems to be insignificant.
For the Tongsheng Tunnel, on the one hand, the impact of the train on it is small due to its type (double-line tunnel), relatively high temperature outside the tunnel, small train density. On the other hand, the angle between the wind direction and the dominant wind direction is small, the natural wind is the main factor to determine the thermal regime of the tunnel in the cold season [27]. Therefore, we mainly considered the influence of natural wind in the study, without considering the trains.
Furthermore, neural networks have been widely used in civil engineering. Huang et al. [28] reckoned that the application of BIM, machine learning, and computer vision in underground buildings makes the processes and subsystems of underground buildings more visible and reliable. Obviously, with the development of information technology, intellectualization has become a hotspot in the field of civil engineering. For example, in terms of geological survey and prediction, Asadi [29] used artificial neural networks to predict the uniaxial compressive strength of formation rocks in petroleum fields. Vezhapparambu et al. [30] used multivariate analysis, neural adaptive learning algorithms, and machine learning to distinguish different lithologies. Klyuchnikov et al. [31] proposed a novel approach based on machine learning classification methods and data mining on sensor readings to identify rock types at the drilling bit. In addition, a neural network has been applied in the mechanical performance analysis of tunnel corrugated plate support structures [32] and the induced wind speed in subway stations [33], [34].
Besides, in the aspects of tunnel construction and operation safety, Liu et al. [35] designed a tunnel ventilation intelligent frequency control system based on a radial basis function neural network. Wu et al. [36], [37] used neural networks to predict the fire source in the tunnel numerical model and then predict the temperature distribution in the tunnel in advance based on a limited temperature sensor. Deng et al. [38] used historical data from 50 tunnels and the combined fuzzy method with a BP neural network to establish a risk evaluation model. Li, Xue et al. [39] established a BP neural network model for predicting the lagging deformation of the underwater shield tunnel.
In general, the temperature field of the tunnel in cold regions is significantly influenced by the meteorological factors at the tunnel entrance. However, no study has comprehensively reflected the influence of meteorological factors or reported the application of neural networks in the research of tunnels in cold regions. In this paper, the reliability of the tunnel temperature calculation model in the cold region is first verified through a field test. Then the influence of airflow factors on the distribution of the tunnel temperature field was studied, and the sensitivity of each factor was analyzed by orthogonal experiments. Finally, based on the data calculated, a BP neural network was created to predict the freezing depth and heat-adjusting depth in order to make specific anti-freeze designs more convenient and flexible.

2. Methods
2.1. Calculation conditions for the Tongsheng Tunnel
Tongsheng Tunnel, located in Lingyuan City, Liaoning Province, China (as shown in Fig. 2), is a double-line with a total length of 3780 m (the longitudinal section is shown in Fig. 3). The area is located in the mid-latitude temperate continental monsoon climate zone, where the winter is extremely cold for a long time and the average temperature of the coldest month of the calendar year is −9.6 °C, and the average wind speed of the calendar year is 2 m/s. Additionally, there is a high groundwater content in the surrounding rock at the entrance and exit of the tunnel. Frost damage commonly occurs due to extremely low temperatures, strong natural winds, as well as abundant groundwater, affecting structural safety and public transportation.

2.2. Numerical simulation
2.2.1. Calculation model
A commercial CFD software, Ansys Fluent, was used to implement all of the numerical simulations in the study. Through a numerical calculation, the thermal influence area around the tunnel was determined, and the dimensions horizontally from the side walls of the tunnel and vertically from the bottom of the tunnel were determined according to the calculation results, which can ensure that these boundaries were far enough from the tunnel, as shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Numerical Model of Tongsheng Tunnel.

A three-dimensional numerical model with 543,495 elements was established, based on the specific terrain and surrounding rock conditions, as shown in Fig. 6.
In general, the air flow inside the tunnel is often considered as a three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow. In this paper, the standard k-ε model was chosen due to its efficiency and wide application. The parameters used in the k − ε model were σk, σε, Cε1, Cε2, and Cμ. The values were σk = 1.00, σε = 1.30, Cε1 = 1.44, Cε2 = 1.92, Cμ = 0.07, as recommended by Launder [40].
Due to the mountain’s being mainly composed of andesite, the thermophysical of surrounding rock parameters are taken as parameters of andesite. According to relevant design data and experimental laboratory tests, thermophysical and geometric parameters of the tunnel lining were determined. The thickness of primary support and secondary lining is 30 cm and 50 cm respectively. And the thermal physical parameters were shown in Table 1.

In this paper, the model was computed in transient mode. And the boundary conditions were set as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2.

Upper boundary	Wall (temperature)	Wall (temperature)
Lower boundary	Flux-Wall (heat flux)	Flux-Wall (heat flux)
Entrance	Adiabatic wall	Velocity-Inlet
Exit	Adiabatic wall	Pressure-Outlet
In Table 2, the temperature in the boundary conditions was obtained by fitting the air temperature data (Eq. (1) in Section 2.1). According to the geological survey report, the geothermal heat flux density was: Q1 = 0.08 W/m2 (from DK293 + 760 to DK295 + 760), Q2 = 0.04 W/m2 (from DK293 + 260 to DK293 + 760 and from DK295 + 760 to DK297 + 040). Moreover, according to the research methods of many scholars [5], [8], [24], the heat flux density of the lower boundary was specified as a constant throughout the year. The fluid–solid coupling surface was set to ‘Interface’, and the other boundary surfaces were set to adiabatic wall surfaces.
2.2.2. Initial ground temperature field
First of all, the unexcavated numerical model was calculated for 500 years to obtain the natural ground temperature field. Then, combined with the disturbance of the construction process and the unstable fluctuation of the surrounding rock temperature, the ground temperature field was calculated under the disturbance of airflow for 3 years, accounting for heat exchange between the tunnel structure, the surrounding rock, and the air. Finally, the initial ground temperature field was used for the following calculations. The specific numerical simulation process is shown in Fig. 7.

2.2.3. Calculation conditions
In this study, the variables of the airflow factors in winter were average air temperature (T), average wind speed (S), and dominating wind direction (D). Furthermore, we set two types of computational conditions (Table 3). The “Verification” condition was aimed at verifying the reliability of numerical simulation, while the “Common” condition was aimed at analyzing the distribution of the temperature field and establishing the required neural network.

2.3. Sensitivity analysis
In this paper, the orthogonal experiment design method was used to analyze the influence degree of airflow factors.
Based on the experimental scheme in Table 4, each numerical simulation was treated as an experiment, and the findings were summarized by the intuitive analysis method to determine the degree of airflow factors and the associated level change trend. The formula applied was:

2.4. Neural network
The finite-element simulation and the model experiment are time-consuming and costly. Though the curve fitting tool is simple, the result is not good enough when there are many variables and the relationship is very complicated. A reliable BP neural network can predict the freezing depth and heat-adjusting depth quickly with less cost and decent accuracy.
Therefore, to make the results of the simulation more practical, after verifying the accuracy of the numerical model, the BP neural network was established by MATLAB (ver. r2019a) to predict the freezing depth and heat-adjusting depth of the tunnel arch bottom when the airflow factor is different from what we have simulated.
In the neural network, T, S, D, and L were the input values. XF and XH were the output values. The sample data was obtained through “Common” in Table 3, for a total of 240 working conditions (10 × 8 × 3 = 240). 70% of the samples were randomly selected as training data, and 30% of the samples were used for verification and testing. The neural network training algorithm in this paper was Levenberg-Marquardt, and the neural network topology was shown in Fig. 8.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Verification of numerical model
To verify the accuracy of the numerical model, the simulation results were compared with the data of the field ground temperature tests. A total of 5 monitoring sections were selected to conduct the temperature measurements (DK296 + 407, DK296 + 272, DK296 + 232, DK296 + 152, DK296 + 112) in the tunnel. Freezing damage was observed in the tunnel, and the installment of the sensors could have exacerbated these problems. Therefore, temperature sensors were placed 4.1 m above the top of the left inner rail. In each section, a hole of about 2.55 m was drilled, and five temperature-measuring cables with sensors were buried in the hole, as shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 10. Comparison of simulation results and field measured data.

Fig. 10 shows the calculated ground temperature of five positions is basically consistent with the actual value, and the temperature rises as radial depth increases. The maximum deviation is 0.45 °C and the average deviation is 0.31 °C, indicating that the numerical model and parameters have good accuracy.
3.2. Analysis of temperature field
We took T = −8 °C, S = 2 m/s, and D = 0° in the “Common” condition as an example to study the law of the tunnel temperature field and to determine the key parts of the tunnel antifreeze design. The calculation result of the coldest day temperature field was shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11. Temperature contour.

Fig. 11 shows the distribution law of the ground temperature field on the coldest day. Affected by low temperature air near the ground, especially the shallow surface, the ground temperature gradually increases with depth. In terms of the temperature of each section, the temperature around the tunnel structure is obviously disturbed, and the disturbance weakens as radial depth increases.
Moreover, the temperature of the tunnel arch bottom in the longitudinal direction was extracted and represented in Fig. 12. Besides, Fig. 12(a) describes the relationship between temperature and burial depth on the coldest day. The connection between temperature and days at a 2 m burial depth is shown in Fig. 12(b).

Fig. 12. Longitudinal temperature curve.

Each temperature curve has a tendency to be high in the center and low on either side that is compatible with the mountain's morphology. The trend becomes more pronounced as depth increases, as shown in Fig. 12(a).
The temperature at the depth of 2 m decreases first and then increases with time, reaching its lowest on the 100th day (February 22), about 50 days after the tunnel's coldest day (The lowest temperature outside the tunnel, January 5), and then rising gradually as a result of the rise in temperature, as shown in Fig. 12(b).
Besides, the tunnel section is approximately a circle. According to different angles, it can be divided into arch bottom, arch waist and arch top in the ring direction, and their heights are also different. Then, the radial temperature of the arch top, arch waist, and arch bottom at 500 m from the entrance of the coldest day was extracted and plotted in Fig. 13.
(1).
The temperature of each part increases as the radial distance increases. When the radial distance exceeds 5 m, the temperature relationship between each part is as follows: arch bottom > arch waist > arch top. Meanwhile, the slope is plain, owing to the heat exchange from air to the tunnel weakening with increasing radial distance, as shown in Fig. 13.
(2).
When the radial distance is less than 5 m, the temperature relationship of each part is as follows: arch bottom < arch waist < arch top, with wall surface temperatures of −7.84 °C, −6.99 °C, and −6.95 °C, respectively. This difference may be caused by different wall shapes, which have different resistance to airflow along the way. As shown in Fig. 13, the wall at the bottom of the arch is flat, the resistance to airflow is the smallest, the speed of air is the largest, and the heat exchange is the most sufficient. Therefore, more attention should be given to the anti-freezing of the arch bottom during tunnel design and construction.

Fig. 13. Temperature change with radial distance.

Then, Fig. 14 describes the relationship between the radial temperature of the arch bottom and days at 500 m from the entrance.
(1).
It can be seen from Fig. 14 that before the 100th day, the arch bottom temperature increases as the depth increases, finally converges to 10 °C. However, after the 100th day, the arch bottom temperature decreases first and then increases with depth, finally converges to 10 °C, which mostly resulted from the air temperature rebounding after the 100th day.
(2).
An auxiliary line with Y = 0 °C was drawn in Fig. 14, and the X value of the intersection with each temperature curve is the XF. Then, we find that the XF gets deeper and then shallower over time. Furthermore, XF on the 100th day is the deepest, which means that freezing damage is most likely to occur. Consequently, this day is used in the following study.

3.3. Influence analysis of airflow factors
In order to learn more about the influence of airflow factors on the temperature field and the law of freezing damage, the four factors of T, S, D, and L on XF and XH were analyzed here. The calculation conditions are shown in the “Common” (Table 3), and the loading time is 100 days (November 14 ∼ February 22).
3.3.1. Air temperature
In this paper, the air temperature functions corresponding to different working conditions were obtained by moving T(d) up and down in the coordinate. Besides, the freezing indexes were shown in.
Table 5. And the influence of different air temperatures on XF and XH of the arch bottom was shown in Fig. 15.

Fig. 15. Simulation of results of T-changed.

Table 5 shows the average air temperature in winter is positively correlated with the temperature in the coldest month. The lower the two, the greater the freezing index.
(1)
As shown in Fig. 15(a), the temperature decreases as the air temperature decreases. Additionally, the slope is rather steep and the difference between both curves is evident when the radial distance is tiny (less than 6 m). However, when the radial distance is greater than 6 m, the slope will gradually become plain, and the difference between these curves is slight. This is due to the diminished impact of air temperature.
(2)
As shown in Fig. 15(b), the tunnel is more susceptible to freezing damage the lower the temperature is. Accordingly, when L = 500 m, XF at T = 0 °C is 0.450 m, while T = −12 °C is 2.692 m, XF increases by 498.22 %.
Therefore, based on Fig. 15(b), freezing damage in tunnel portal section is more likely to occur and should be paid more attention. The buried depth of the drainage ditch should be greater than 2.7 m at the portal, and the buried depth should not be less than 2 m at the other parts of Tongsheng Tunnel, taking into account the coldest temperature (the minimum average winter air temperature in the region is −9.6 °C).
(3)
As shown in Fig. 15(c), XH and T are inversely associated at the same mileage. Accordingly, at L = 500 m, the XH of T = 0 °C and T = −12 °C are 9.107 m and 9.559 m, respectively, representing an increase in XH of 4.96 %.
The low air temperature and the heat exchange between air and tunnel cause the XF and XH to enlarge. Besides, the ratio of XF to XH is also changing. Taking 500 m away from the entrance as an example, the ratio of XF to XH falls from 28.16 % to 4.94 %, a decrease of 23.22%, when T rises from −12 °C to −6 °C.
3.3.2. Wind speed
The influence of wind speed on the XF and XH was shown in Fig. 16.
(1)
It can be seen from Fig. 16(a) that the temperature decreases as wind speed increases. And there are 2 types of slopes: one is relatively steep and the other is plain. This value is similar to the “air temperature” simulation in Section 3.4.1.
(2)
It can be seen from Fig. 16(b) that the larger the S, the more prone to freezing damage to the tunnel. Accordingly, at S = 1 m/s, XF is 1.80 m, and at S = 8 m/s, XF is 2.40 m, increasing by 33.33% at L = 500 m. However, S has little effect on XF when S greater than 5 m/s. Therefore, S = 5 m/s should be considered a crucial parameter for analyzing how wind speed affects tunnel antifreeze designs.
(3)
It can be found from Fig. 16(c) that XH and S are positively correlated at the same distance from the tunnel entrance. XH increases with an increase of S. Accordingly, at L = 100 m, the XH of S = 1 m/s and S = 8 m/s is 7.3 m and 8.2 m, respectively, increasing the XH by 12.3 %.

Fig. 16. Results of S-changed simulation.

In conclusion, the great wind speed strengthens the heat exchange from the air to the tunnel, causing the XF and XH to grow. It can be considered to set up wind barriers or air curtains at the tunnel entrance. At the same time, the ratio of XF and XH is also changing. Taking 500 m away from the entrance as an example, if S increases from 1 m/s to 8 m/s, the ratio of XF and XH increases from 15.24 % to 22.38 %, increasing by 7.14 %.
3.3.3. Wind direction
In this paper, the wind direction was adjusted by changing the angle between the airflow and the tunnel direction. And, the influence of the wind direction on the XF and XH was shown in Fig. 17.
(1).
As shown in Fig. 17 (a), the temperature decreases with decreasing wind direction. And the trend of “temperature” and “radial distance” in the simulation of “wind direction” and “wind speed” is also similar.
(2).
Fig. 17(b) shows that there are two relationships between D and XF. XF is positively correlated with D when L is less than 150 m, and is negatively correlated with D when L is greater than 150 m. Meanwhile, the tunnel design in cold areas should avoid the situation that the tunnel direction is parallel to the wind direction, and should be intersected with the wind direction perpendicular or at a large angle as much as possible.
(3).
From Fig. 17(c), it can be found that there are also two relationships between D and XH.

Fig. 17. Results of D-changed simulation.

This paper believes that when the airflow enters the tunnel at a certain angle, it is first directed to the windward side of the tunnel entrance section before becoming blocked. Thus, the flow state changes, and the turbulent heat transfer intensity increases. The flow direction of the airflow changes but finally flows parallel to the tunnel direction, and the flow speed also slows down. In this process, the heat exchange between the airflow and the tunnel is sufficient, so the XF and XH are large. Therefore, when there is always a large angle between the wind direction of the tunnel area and the tunnel direction, stricter anti-freezing measures should be taken at the entrance of the tunnel. At the same time, the ratio of XF to XH is also changing. And taking 500 m away from the entrance as an example, the ratio of XF to XH also decreases from 19.53 % to 15.24 %, decreasing by 4.29 % when D increases from 0° to 60°.
3.4. Sensitivity analysis of airflow factors
Using the basic parameter values (T = −6 °C, S = 4 m/s, D = 30°) of each factor to form 3 levels with approximately 100% positive and negative fluctuations, a 3-factor 3-level orthogonal table L9 (3 × 3) was formed, and the experiments were arranged accordingly. Then, combined with the distribution range of the three factors, the orthogonal design calculation scheme was determined. Finally, the calculation results of the evaluation indexes are shown in Table 6, and the results of range analysis are shown in Table 7 and Table 8.

In terms of the freezing depth of the arch bottom, the sensitivity degree of airflow factors is T (1.814), S (0.841), and D (0.370). As a result, this demonstrates that of the three components, T has the greatest influence, followed by S and D. However, the influence of D cannot be ignored, as shown in Table 7.
In terms of the heat-adjusting depth of the tunnel arch bottom, the sensitivity degrees of influencing factors are T (3.577), S (0.711), and D (0.331). Thus, among the three elements, T has the greatest influence, S has the second-greatest influence, and D has the least influence, as shown in Table 8.
In general, the influence sensitivity of the tunnel arch bottom temperature field from large to small is T > S > D. Therefore, the average winter wind temperature (T) should be paid more attention to in the study of tunnel freezing damage.
3.5. Prediction of neural network
In Table 3, 240 working conditions (10 × 8 × 3 = 240) were calculated and 1200 samples (240 × 5 = 1200) were obtained. Among the 1200 samples, 70% were randomly chosen to be the training data, and 30% were used for validation testing. The results are shown in Fig. 18, where (a) and (b) represent the mean square error (MSE) and regression value (R) of the neural network, respectively.

MSE is the mean–variance between output and target (0 means no error, and R is the correlation between output and target). R = 1 means a close relationship, and 0 means a random relationship. Fig. 18 shows that MSE = 0.0039744, which means that the neural network performs well. Then, R is very close to 1, indicating that XF and XH are closely related to T, S, and D.
In order to verify the accuracy of the neural network, T = −3.6 °C, S = 2 m/s, and D = 0 (the actual engineering situation) were respectively used as input values. In this prediction, the negative temperature action time is 100 days, the freezing index is 360.71 °C· d, and the average temperature of the coldest month is −5.49 °C. In addition, the predicted results and errors of the trained neural network are shown in Table 9.

1500	0.39	14.86	0.40	14.85	2.56	0.07
In Table 9, the maximum relative error of XF is 2.56 %, and the maximum relative error of XH is 1.34 %, with a small error, which further verifies the correctness of the neural network. Thus, the network and results can provide a basis for the buried depth of the central drainage ditch and the longitudinal length of the anti-freezing measures.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical model of airflow-lining-surrounding rock coupled heat transfer was built. Firstly, the accuracy of the numerical model was verified by a field measurement. Then the distribution law of the tunnel temperature field in the cold region was analyzed. The influence of airflow factors (T, S, and D) on the tunnel temperature field was also studied. Next, the sensitivity of airflow factors was analyzed by an orthogonal experiment. Finally, a BP neural network was established to predict the freezing depth and heat-adjusting depth of the arch bottom. Based on the research results and analysis of this paper, the following conclusions are drawn:
(1).
The temperature field distribution law of the tunnel in the cold region is as follows: In the longitudinal direction of the tunnel, the formation temperature shows a trend of being high in the middle and low on both sides, affected by the terrain; in the radial direction, the temperature decreases with a decrease in the radial distance under the influence of cold air; in the ring direction, the tunnel arch bottom temperature is the lowest, and its wall temperature is 12.16% and 12.81% lower than the tunnel arch waist and tunnel arch top, respectively. Hence, more attention should be paid to the bottom of the tunnel, as drainage ditches and other facilities are arranged at the bottom of it.
(2).
The relationship between airflow factors and XF and XH is as follows: XF and XH are negatively correlated with T, and the ratio of XF to XH has dropped by 23.22% (at 500 m from the entrance, the following ratios of XF and XH both refer to this position); XF and XH are positively correlated with S, and the ratio of XF to XH has increased by 7.14%; when L is less than 150 m, XF and XH are positively correlated with D. But, when L is longer than 150 m, XF and XH are negatively correlated with D, and the ratio of XF to XH drops by 4.29%.
(3).
The degree of influence sensitivity to the temperature field at the bottom of the tunnel arch is as follows: average winter wind temperature (T) > average winter wind speed (S) > wind direction (D). Therefore, in the study of tunnel freezing damage occurrence mechanisms and prevention and control, a comprehensive analysis of airflow conditions should be carried out.
(4).
When designing tunnels in cold regions, the tunnel direction should be avoided parallel to the wind direction, and should be intersected perpendicular to the wind direction or at a large angle as much as possible. And pay more attention to the antifreeze design of the tunnel portal section.
(5).
A BP neural network was established to predict the freezing depth and heat-adjusting depth of the tunnel arch bottom through T, S, D, and L. Besides, the R of the prediction results is very close to 1, and MSE = 0.0039744, with a small error, indicating that the established neural network has good performance. Therefore, the BP neural network can not only effectively predict the freezing range at the bottom of the tunnel but also provide the basis for the anti-freezing design of the tunnel.
