Abstract
Quantitative assessment of environmental conditions and their loading effects is crucial for the optimal design of marine structures, especially offshore platforms subject to extreme environmental conditions. Wave load, particularly irregular wave load, significantly influences the structural response and ultimate strength of jacket-type offshore platforms (JTOPs) throughout their operational life. The dynamic nature of these irregular wave loads necessitates the use of advanced time history analysis to accurately capture their impact. This study aims to enhance the understanding of how foundation conditions impact failure modes and the structural response of JTOPs through an innovative incremental irregular wave dynamic analysis procedure. By focusing on an existing steel jacket-type platform in the Persian Gulf, this research evaluates six models with varying soil profiles and pile conditions to assess their effects on structural performance. The application of incremental irregular wave dynamic analysis provides a more precise and realistic modeling of wave impacts compared to traditional methods. The findings demonstrate that stronger soil profiles and improved pile conditions significantly enhance structural integrity, particularly under extreme loading conditions. Specifically, optimizing pile configurations is critical for enabling the structure to endure larger waves, whereas variations in the yield stress of steel material have a lesser impact on the platform's response. Additionally, the dynamic results are compared with pushover analysis, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the pushover analysis compared to incremental irregular wave analysis method used in this study.

1. Introduction
Energy serves as the driving force behind the advancement of civilization (Chandrasekaran, 2018). As oil and gas play an increasingly pivotal role in global trade (Abyani et al., 2022), the construction of offshore oil and gas production platforms has become essential. Among these, steel jacket-type offshore platforms (JTOPs) are significant structures exposed to extreme environmental loads, making their safety paramount. Evaluating the jacket structure and foundation response of existing JTOPs enhances our understanding of their resilience to environmental forces, providing well-informed suggestions for designs that are safer, more dependable, and cost-effective.
Over the past three decades, numerous researchers have explored the nonlinear behavior of offshore structures, particularly focusing on JTOPs and their response to environmental forces (Skallerud and Amdahl, 2002; Zarrin et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Among the various environmental loads affecting offshore structures, wave load is one of the most significant. The impact of wave loads on JTOPs has been extensively studied, underscoring their critical importance in ensuring the structural integrity and stability of these platforms (Sruthi and Sriram, 2017; Mohajernassab et al., 2017; Aggarwal et al., 2019; Enferadi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020).
The ultimate strength of offshore structures, which refers to the maximum load-carrying capacity of the structure before failure (Sharifian et al., 2015), is a critical factor in ensuring the safety and reliability of offshore platforms, particularly in harsh marine environments. Basack et al. (2022) provided valuable insights into the development of failure mechanism analysis and design techniques for offshore wind turbine pile foundations. They addressed the challenges posed by cyclic loads from wind and waves on soft marine soils, emphasizing the need for an appropriate design methodology. Extensive research has aimed at determining the ultimate strength and failure mechanisms of JTOPs when subjected to wave-induced stresses, with significant contributions from scholars such as Morin et al. (1998), Manuel et al. (1998), Chakrabarti et al. (2005), Mirzadeh Niasar et al. (2008), Shayanfar and Memarpour (2010), Moradi et al. (2020), and Kim et al. (2023). Several factors influence the ultimate strength of JTOPs, including material properties, structural configuration, foundation conditions, and wave characteristics. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing robust offshore platforms capable of withstanding the demanding conditions they face.
Foundation nonlinearity, especially in the pile foundation, significantly impacts the dynamic characteristics and responses of JTOPs. Key studies by El Naggar and Novak (1995), Mostafa and El Naggar (2004), Naggar and Novak (1996) have investigated how this nonlinearity affects the dynamic responses of fixed offshore towers, highlighting the profound impact of pile-soil-pile interaction on structural behavior. Asgarian and Lesani (2009) demonstrated through pushover analysis that incorporating soil-pile-structure interactions optimizes capacity assessment. Chatziioannou et al. (2017) investigated the impact of nonlinearities on the design of an existing offshore platform, accounting for interactions between waves and the structure, as well as the soil and the structure. Asgarian et al. (2019) carried out a static pushover analysis to examine how soil characteristics affect the behavior and failure modes of JTOP structures, with wave loading serving as the lateral force pattern applied to the platform. Raheem et al. (2020) and Abdel Raheem et al. (2022) carried out in-place analyses to investigate the effect of pile-soil-structure interaction on the structural response of jacket offshore platforms, emphasizing the importance of flexible foundation modeling for accurately predicting platform behavior under environmental loads.
Wave characteristics, such as height, period, and direction, are crucial factors that significantly influence the ultimate capacity of offshore structures by affecting the magnitude and distribution of dynamic loads they must withstand. Various wave theories are employed to describe and predict these characteristics. Extensive research has been conducted to study these theories and enhance the understanding and prediction of wave impacts on offshore structures. Chandrasekaran et al. (2007) investigated the application of Stokes nonlinear wave theory to analyze the response behavior of triangular tension leg platforms (TLPs) under regular wave conditions. This study addressed the complexities of wave-structure interactions by employing Stokes' higher-order wave theory, which accounts for nonlinear effects crucial for accurately predicting the dynamic responses of TLPs. The findings indicated that responses predicted by Stokes' theory were lower compared to those obtained using Airy's linear wave theory, highlighting the importance of incorporating nonlinear wave effects in the design and analysis of offshore structures. Haritos (2007) provided a comprehensive overview of both linear and nonlinear water wave theories. This study introduced methods for analyzing and designing offshore structures using these theories, underscoring their critical role in predicting wave impacts and ensuring structural safety under extreme marine conditions. Wang et al. (2020) employed a combination of experimental and numerical methods to examine the effects of steep regular waves on jacket structures. The research emphasized the significance of advanced wave theories in accurately predicting wave loads and dynamic responses, thereby underscoring their necessity in designing safe offshore structures under extreme conditions. These studies collectively highlight the pivotal role of advanced wave theories in enhancing the design, analysis, and safety of offshore structures, ensuring their adaptability to the complex and dynamic marine environment.
Due to the stochastic environment and inherent randomness of seas, irregular wave theory is more suitable than regular wave theories for accurately representing marine conditions. Schloer et al. (2011) found that stream function theory often underestimates wave forces on monopile foundations compared to irregular wave theory. Marino et al. (2013) introduced a computationally efficient method to simulate irregular waves and their effects on offshore wind turbines. Roy et al. (2017) used the JONSWAP spectrum for a coupled numerical analysis of a spar platform's response to irregular waves. Aggarwal et al. (2019) showed that higher-frequency components in breaking wave forces significantly impact monopile structures. Wang et al. (2021) investigated the effects of irregular waves on a 10 MW offshore wind turbine monopile using advanced coupled simulations. These studies underscore the critical importance of using irregular wave theories in offshore engineering for accurate modeling, safety, and cost efficiency.
There are many ways to analyze structures subjected to wave forces. A limited number of studies have introduced innovative methods for evaluating offshore structures. Golafshani et al. (2011) developed Incremental Wave Analysis, a technique to accurately determine various limit states and the behavior of JTOPs under deterministic regular wave loading, strongly advocating for dynamic analysis, especially due to the pile foundation characteristic of these platforms. Zeinoddini et al. (2012) proposed the Endurance Wave Analysis method for the nonlinear dynamic analysis and evaluation of offshore structures facing irregular wave forces. Hezarjaribi et al. (2013) reported that soil properties significantly influence JTOP performance in extreme wave conditions in the Persian Gulf using Static Incremental Wave Analysis (SIWA) and Dynamic Incremental Wave Analysis (DIWA) performed with regular Stokes wave theory. Mirzadeh et al. (2015) introduced a methodology for calculating the failure probability of dynamically sensitive offshore structures exposed to extreme random wave conditions, utilizing the Constrained NewWave technique in their wave modeling to reflect the sea-state's randomness, with application to a jack-up platform example. Finally, Gaidai et al. (2018) unveiled a universal Monte Carlo-based strategy for predicting the extreme long-term responses of offshore structures, leveraging satellite-derived global wave statistics.
The review of existing literature highlights the complexity and critical importance of accurately assessing the dynamic responses and failure modes of Jacket Type Offshore Platforms (JTOPs), particularly given the nonlinear interactions between wave loads, structural configurations, and foundation conditions. Although significant strides have been made in understanding these factors individually, there remains a gap in comprehensively analyzing their combined effects using advanced wave theories and dynamic analysis methods. Existing studies have primarily focused on pushover analysis, which, while valuable, fails to capture the complexities of real-world environmental conditions. Pushover analysis typically employs simplified load patterns that do not accurately represent the complex, dynamic nature of irregular wave forces experienced by offshore structures, leading to an incomplete understanding of the structural response under realistic sea conditions. Moreover, a few studies that assessed the response of JTOPs under dynamic wave loadings utilized regular deterministic wave theories (Golafshani et al., 2011; Hezarjaribi et al., 2013). This study aims to bridge this gap by using the concept of Incremental Wave Analysis (IWA) and introducing Incremental Irregular Wave Dynamic Analysis. By incorporating irregular wave profiles, the approach presented provides a more accurate representation of the dynamic forces acting on offshore structures, particularly under complex increasing wave loading conditions.
This innovative approach will evaluate the effects of foundation conditions on the failure modes and ultimate capacity of an existing JTOP structure in the Persian Gulf. The interplay between the foundation and structure is critical for understanding the overall response of the platform, especially when subjected to extreme irregular wave events. By leveraging OpenSees finite element software, these interactions are modeled with a higher degree of detail and accuracy. By doing so, it will provide deeper insights into the resilience of these structures under realistic marine conditions, ultimately contributing to safer, more reliable, and cost-effective offshore platform designs.
2. Incremental irregular wave analysis
This section outlines a relatively novel approach called Incremental Irregular Wave Analysis (IIWA). This method builds upon the Incremental Wave Analysis (IWA), originally introduced as an alternative to the pushover approach. While IWA offers a more accurate assessment compared to the pushover method (Golafshani et al., 2011), its reliance on regular waves limits its applicability due to the neglect of wave irregularity effects. This study extends IWA by incorporating irregular wave loads to evaluate the ultimate capacity and collapse behavior of Jacket Type Offshore Platforms (JTOP) under environmental wave loading.
2.1. Irregular wave
Offshore structures must operate in harsh environments, facing natural hazards such as winds, currents, and waves. Realistic simulations of these conditions are crucial for accurate platform performance assessments. Waves, in particular, are the most impactful phenomenon, exhibiting complex behaviors in nature. A key characteristic of sea waves is their irregular waveform, and simulating these waves over time provides a more accurate prediction of sea states.
In practice, the profile of (linear) irregular waves comprises numerous linear wave components. To accurately represent an irregular wave, a wave energy spectrum is utilized instead of direct measurements of wave surface elevation (Fig. 1). This spectrum conveys critical information about the amplitude and frequency of each wave component. The loss of initial phase information is compensated for by assigning a random phase (
) to each component, ensuring a comprehensive and realistic depiction of wave dynamics.

The time series for the surface elevation of irregular waves can be generated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to the wave energy spectrum. This process yields a finite set of discrete linear wave components. The surface elevation of the irregular wave (
) is constructed by superimposing these components, creating a comprehensive and detailed representation of wave dynamics (Eq. (1)):

By employing these methods, a realistic time series for the surface elevation of irregular waves can be generated, essential for offshore structural analysis.
2.2. Irregular wave loading on the structural members
This section presents a methodology for assessing the loads induced by irregular waves on a Jacket Type Offshore Platform (JTOP) structure. To predict wave loads on JTOP structures, where the ratio of the wavelength to the cylindrical member diameter generally exceeds 5, the well-known Morison equation is applicable. This equation effectively captures the hydrodynamic forces exerted by waves on slender members of offshore structures. Recognizing the pivotal role of fluid-structure interaction in dynamic loading, it is imperative to account for the structure's motion when calculating the wave force. This can be achieved by using relative velocity and acceleration between the structure and the surrounding fluid. According to the Morison equation, the total wave force (
) can be determined by summing the drag force (
) and the inertia force (
), both of which are functions of the relative velocity and acceleration between the fluid and the structure. The inertia force itself consists of two components due to the presence of relative acceleration:
1.
The added mass force (
), which is proportional to the acceleration of the fluid relative to the structure and accounts for the additional inertial effects due to the surrounding fluid mass moving with the structure.
2.
The Froude-Krylov force (
), which is proportional to the fluid acceleration and represents the inertial force exerted by the undisturbed fluid acceleration.
Thus, the differential form of the Morison equation can be expressed as:
(3)
Where:
 is the differential total wave force.
 is the fluid density.
 is the diameter of the cylindrical member.
 is the relative velocity between the fluid and the structure.
 is the relative acceleration between the fluid and the structure.
 is the fluid acceleration.
 is the differential length of the cylindrical member.
 is the drag coefficient
 is the inertia coefficient.
To transition from the general framework of the Morison equation to the specific calculation of irregular wave forces on JTOP structures, it is crucial to calculate the kinematics of the irregular waves. By employing the superposition principle to a collection of linear waves, it is possible to calculate both the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity and acceleration of water particles at any given point 
 within the generated irregular wave surface. These components can be determined as functions of time, as follows:

 and time 
, respectively.
 and 
 are the horizontal and vertical accelerations of water particles at point 
 and time 
, respectively.

-th wave component.

By incorporating the water particle kinematics along with the structure's velocity (
) and acceleration (
), and using Eq. (3) as the foundation, the following equation is derived to compute the irregular wave force acting normal to the JTOP members in this study. It should be mentioned that the acceleration and velocity components are evaluated normal to the member axis.

Where:

.
It is obvious that the total wave force (
) is obtained by integrating Eq. (8) along the member axis.
3. Modeling description
The case study examined in this paper is a 3D model of a JTOP located at a water depth of 74.6 m in the Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as S1). The S1 platform comprises a four-leg jacket with four braced bays, anchored to the seabed by four piles that pass through the legs. The gap between the pile and the leg is filled with grout, creating a composite section known as the grouted section. The surrounding legs of the jacket are battered to 1:10 on one side and vertical on the other. The height of the jacket is 83.6 m, with plan dimensions of 23.0 m × 23.0 m at the working point elevation and 23.0 m × 31.6 m at the mud line. The platform is initially designed and analyzed in accordance with the requirements of API RP2A-WSD (2007). For a detailed description of the JTOP structure analyzed in this paper, refer to Sharifian et al. (2015) and Abyani et al. (2018).
3.1. Structural modeling
The 3D numerical model of the S1 platform is developed using the finite element software OpenSees (Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulations) (Mazzoni et al., 2006). For the sake of simplicity, only the primary structural elements are included in the finite element model. A force-based nonlinear beam-column element, which accounts for the spread of plasticity along the element, is employed to represent all pile and jacket components (Spacone et al., 1996). The fiber discretization approach is utilized to define the characteristics of the elements' cross-sections by dividing them into small, discrete fibers. Each structural member is segmented into ten equal lengths, with the cross-sections further subdivided into four radial and sixteen circumferential fibers. This method breaks down the geometric configuration into basic shapes like squares, rectangles, and triangles, enabling flexible section definitions composed of various materials, making it particularly well-suited for defining the platform's leg members. The continuity equation for each section is derived from the material's stress-strain relationships. It is assumed that the fibers behave uniaxially, with the strain in each fiber calculated from the centroidal strain and section curvature, adhering to Bernoulli's assumption that plane sections remain flat and perpendicular to the element axis during bending. However, one limitation of the fiber discretization approach is that it does not account for local buckling behavior, and the member section remains stable even during extreme nonlinear excursions. It should be noted that as the diameter-to-thickness ratio increases, the accuracy of the fiber section simulation results improves.
In this study, Steel02 material is used to model the platform elements, while the Concrete01 material is used to model the gap grout between the pile and leg in jacket legs. The Menegotto-Pinto model (Menegotto, 1973) is employed as a constitutive model to characterize the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the pile and jacket steel materials. This model is well-regarded for its ability to smoothly transition from elastic to plastic behavior, effectively capturing the Bauschinger effect in cyclic loading scenarios. Its precision in predicting hysteretic behavior significantly enhances the reliability of structural analysis under both cyclic and dynamic loading conditions.
To simulate brace buckling effects, an initial imperfection of 0.001L is applied at the mid-span of each brace, where L represents the brace length. The braces' global buckling and post-buckling behavior are fully modeled using this method, along with Corotational coordinate transformation (Honarvar et al., 2007). This procedure is both common and accurate in offshore modeling practice for simulating the snap-through behavior of brace buckling, as previously employed by many scholars (Golafshani et al., 2011; Zarrin et al., 2018, Zarrin et al., 2022; Abyani et al., 2019). In addition to modeling buckling and post-buckling behavior, the developed numerical model incorporates potential failure due to low-cycle fatigue. The model includes a uniaxial fatigue material (Mazzoni et al., 2006) designed to simulate the fatigue behavior of materials under cyclic loading. This is achieved using a modified rainflow cycle counting algorithm in conjunction with Miner's Rule to track strain amplitudes and accumulate damage. The fatigue material model is applied over the primary material (Steel 02 in this case), maintaining its stress-strain relationship until the fatigue material model reaches a damage level of 1. At this threshold, the load-carrying capacity of the primary material is reduced to zero, resulting in a more realistic prediction of global structural collapse. In this study, for the fatigue material of the jacket brace members, the strain at which one cycle causes failure (
) and the slope of the Coffin-Manson curve (m) are set to 0.095 and −0.5, respectively, based on the test results reported by Uriz and Mahin (2008).
The co-rotational formulation (De Souza, 2000) is employed in the numerical model to effectively address large displacements and geometric nonlinearity. This approach involves transforming the stiffness matrix from local to global coordinates, ensuring an accurate representation of structural behavior under loading conditions. By continuously updating the stiffness matrix throughout the analysis, the model maintains precise predictions of structural responses amid significant deformations, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of the assessments.
To assess the accuracy and validity of the finite element modeling approach, this study evaluated the experimental and numerical strut model tested by Black et al. (1980). A fiber brace model was developed in OpenSees using a fiber-based beam-column model to replicate the previously tested strut (Vaezi Vaznaa and Zarrin, 2020). The selected strut was an extra-strong steel pipe with a 4-inch diameter, welded to clevises at both ends to simulate pin connections. The distance between the clevis centers was 118.4 inches, yielding a slenderness (kl/r) ratio of 80. The numerical model was constructed with eight force-based elements, considering the strut member's non-rectilinearity, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b and c present the experimentally and numerically derived axial force–axial displacement hysteresis loops for this specimen. As shown in Fig. 2, there is a remarkable correlation between the experimental results and the predictions of the force-based brace model.

To perform dynamic analysis and define the fundamental mode shapes of the structure, establishing the dynamic mass matrix is essential. The mass considered for the jacket in the analysis is approximately 5000 tons. This mass includes the main structure, entrapped water in flooded elements, added mass for submerged members, and non-structural components such as barge bumpers, boat landings, anodes, and mud mats. These are modeled as lumped masses at the corresponding jacket node elevations in the dynamic analysis. The deck mass, approximately 2800 tons, includes structural components, mechanical and electrical equipment, pipe masses, and bridge reactions. Modeled as lumped masses, the deck mass is applied as concentrated loads on all deck nodes. All the aforementioned masses are specified at the two end nodes of each element to define dynamic masses in the longitudinal, transverse, and vertical directions. A 2 % critical damping ratio is considered to model the inherent material damping using the Rayleigh damping method (Zarrin et al., 2018; Abyani et al., 2019).
An extensive modal analysis has been conducted on the S1 platform model to determine its natural vibration periods and corresponding mode shapes. The results of this analysis, which incorporate the detailed dynamic mass matrix, are summarized in Table 1.

Period (s)	2.18	1.59	1.11	1.02	0.97	0.78	0.74	0.71	0.66	0.64
3.2. Foundation modeling
The foundation of the S1 platform consists of four main piles driven through the jacket legs. These piles extend from the mudline to a depth of 98 m, with an outside diameter of 1320 mm and a wall thickness of 55 mm at the mudline level. To investigate the effects of different foundation conditions on the platform's failure modes, various soil and pile conditions are modeled while maintaining the same platform configuration. Detailed discussions regarding these investigations will be presented in the following sections.
3.2.1. Soil profiles
In this study, two types of soil profiles—SP1 and SP2—are considered to investigate the effect of soil conditions on the platform's behavior. The properties of these soil profiles are presented in Table 2, Table 3. Notably, both SP1 and SP2 profiles are derived from actual geotechnical reports based on drilled soil borings conducted at two different locations in the Persian Gulf. In terms of lateral strength, the SP2 soil profile is, on average, 1.7 times stronger than the SP1 profile. Additionally, the axial strength of SP2 is, on average, 1.3 times greater than that of SP1.

3.2.2. Soil-pile-structure interaction
This paper examines the impact of environmental loads such as waves, currents, and wind on the dynamic behavior of JTOPs. These loads can either mitigate or intensify the dynamic effects, depending on the foundation characteristics and the soil profile at the site. Therefore, the interaction between the pile, soil, and structure is pivotal in the entire modeling process.
To model this interaction, the study employs the Beam on Nonlinear Winkler Foundation (BNWF) approach, a widely adopted method that effectively balances computational efficiency with accuracy. This method represents the pile as a series of nonlinear beam-column elements supported by nonlinear springs and dashpots that simulate soil response within the OpenSees software. These springs are typically modeled using zero-length elements with uniaxial material models such as PySimple1, TzSimple1, and QzSimple1. The zero-length springs are connected at various points along the pile to accurately reflect the properties of each soil layer. Additionally, dashpots are incorporated to provide damping and are integrated either in series or parallel with the nonlinear springs to simulate energy dissipation during dynamic loading, thereby enhancing the accuracy of structural response predictions.
The PySimple1 material model is a valuable tool for simulating soil lateral resistance. Developed and integrated into the OpenSees framework by Boulanger et al. (1999), this model effectively captures the nonlinear soil response under various loading conditions through a detailed p-y curve formulation. This formulation includes three components in series: elastic (p-ye), plastic (p-yp), and gap (p-yg). The elastic component represents the soil's initial stiffness, while the plastic component accounts for yielding and post-yield behavior. Additionally, a radiation damping dashpot is incorporated parallel to the elastic element. The gap component, essential for modeling the interaction between the soil and structural elements, includes a nonlinear closure spring (pc-yg) in parallel with a nonlinear drag spring (pd-yg).
Accurate simulation using the PySimple1 model necessitates precise calibration with in situ soil parameters derived from site-specific geotechnical investigations. The critical soil characteristics, presented in Table 2, Table 3, include the types and depths of soil layers, shear strengths, angles of friction (
), effective unit weights (
), strain at 50% stress level (
), and the J parameter. These characteristics are essential for defining the soil's nonlinear behavior in soil-pile interaction modeling. They form the foundation for developing reliable p-y curves that describe the relationship between lateral soil resistance per unit length of the pile and the pile's lateral deflection. Utilizing these soil characteristics, key input parameters for the PySimple1 model—namely, the ultimate load capacity (
) and the strain at 50% stress level (
)—are derived. The foundational curves, based on soil types such as soft clay, stiff clay, and sand, are sourced from established research and guidelines, including Matlock (1970), Reese and Welch (1975), and API (RP2A-WSD, 2007).
Vertical soil-pile interaction behaviors are modeled using TzSimple1 and QzSimple1 uniaxial materials for t-z and q-z springs. TzSimple1 captures the pile's skin friction using t-z curves, while QzSimple1 simulates the end-bearing reaction with q-z curves. Accurate modeling within the OpenSees framework employs specific soil characteristics obtained from geotechnical investigations. The backbone curves for these materials are derived based on the guidelines provided in API (RP2A-WSD, 2007), ensuring realistic simulation of nonlinear load-displacement behavior essential for pile foundation design. By implementing these models, OpenSees can accurately account for the nonlinear behavior of the soil under lateral, axial, and end-bearing loads. This detailed representation allows for a more precise prediction of the dynamic response of offshore jacket structures, considering the intricate interactions between the pile and the surrounding soil. The effectiveness of this modeling approach for soil-pile-structure interaction has been validated by Asgarian et al. (2013) and Zarrin et al. (2017).

3.3. Modeling scenarios
In this paper, several models of the S1 platform are developed by varying parameters such as soil type, pile section geometries, and the yield stress of the steel used in the piles. Six distinct scenarios, detailed in Table 4, are analyzed to evaluate both the individual and combined effects of these parameters on the JTOP response. This investigation provides valuable insights into how various foundation conditions affect the structural performance of the platform.

4. Incremental irregular wave generation procedure
This section outlines the methodology employed to calculate irregular wave loads on a Jacket Type Offshore Platform (JTOP) structure, a critical component of the analytical procedure adopted in this study. Due to the absence of a predefined command in OpenSees software for explicitly modeling wave forces, it was necessary to develop a custom code to carry out the analysis. This code extracts the time history of the irregular wave directly from the wave spectra and ensures the precise application of loads to the platform. The methodology is implemented through the following steps:
Step1: Wave Energy Spectrum Generation
As previously mentioned, an irregular wave can be characterized by the wave energy spectrum. Based on DNV recommendations, the most probable individual wave period for extreme wave heights can be expressed as (Det Norske Veritas, 2010):
(10)
Furthermore, according to the Rayleigh distribution, the most probable value for the ratio of 
 can be expressed as (Det Norske Veritas, 2011; Goda, 2010):
(11)
which is a function of the number of waves 
 within a record.
For the simulation of an irregular wave that accurately represents a real sea state, it is recommended that at least 1000 sinusoidal wave components be employed (Det Norske Veritas, 2011). Taking this recommendation into account, and substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (10), the relationship between the significant wave height and peak period in this study is defined by the following equation:
(12)
Regarding Eq. (12), a JONSWAP spectrum is described by the specified significant wave height and the corresponding peak angular frequency 
.
Step2: Irregular Wave Time History Generation
The generated spectrum is divided into 1000 segments within the interval 
, where the lower and upper limits are assumed as 
 and 
, respectively. Using these 1000 linear wave components extracted from the wave spectrum, a 3-h time history of the irregular wave is generated according to the procedure detailed in Section 2 (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Time history of 3 h irregular wave.

Conducting a nonlinear dynamic analysis over the entire 3-h time history of the irregular wave involves highly demanding and time-consuming calculations. To address this challenge, it is more practical to focus on the time interval that results in the maximum structural response, which generally coincides with the peak wave height of the sea surface elevation (Golafshani et al., 2011). In this study, the relevant time frame is determined by identifying the highest wave elevation within the 3-h period. This interval extends from 300 s before the peak surface elevation to 300 s after it (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Selecting the proper interval of wave time history.

In this step, the structure is subjected to a 600-s time history of irregular waves, with the maximum wave elevation occurring at the midpoint of this interval. The irregular wave characteristics are defined, assuming uni-directional wave propagation along the x-axis for simplicity. For each structural element, properties are generated, including the tags for the two end nodes and the diameter of each element, followed by the calculation of their lengths. The irregular wave surface elevation is computed at the two end nodes of all defined elements. The code then checks whether each node is submerged or located within the splash zone. If this condition is met, the instantaneous water particle kinematics are determined using extrapolated Airy theory, considering the coordinates of the nodes and their positions relative to the surface elevation. The effect of the current is also incorporated at this stage, with the current assumed to be uni-directional and parallel to the wave direction. Based on site-specific environmental data, the current velocity is approximated as 0.4 m/s at a depth of 0.5 m above the seabed, increasing linearly to 1.1 m/s at the wave surface elevation. This current velocity is vectorially added to the water particle velocities. The structure's velocity is extracted using software to determine the relative velocity. The code identifies the angle between the incident wave and the structural element, allowing for the transformation of the extracted instantaneous relative velocity and acceleration into the local axes of the element (Section 2 (Eq. (9))). The Morison wave force is then calculated at the start and end nodes of each submerged element using the equation provided in Section 2 (Eq. (8)), incorporating the effects of marine growth. The drag and inertia coefficients are approximated as 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, in accordance with API recommendations for rough circular cylinders. These forces are applied as point forces to the two end nodes of element and then transformed into the global coordinate system. This process is repeated for the entire wave time history, concluding when the time history is fully processed. Fig. 6 illustrates the logical scheme of this process.

5. Dynamic incremental irregular wave analysis and results
In this section, the study investigates the effect of foundation conditions on the performance of the sample JTOP through dynamic incremental irregular wave analysis. The structural analysis methodology comprises three main steps:
Initial Analysis: The model first undergoes a linear static analysis with the application of gravity loads, establishing a baseline for further analysis.
Wind Load Analysis: In the second step, wind loads are applied to the structure. Since irregular wave loading is the primary trigger for the dynamic response of the models, the dynamic effects of wind loads are neglected to reduce computational time, and a quasi-static analysis is performed instead. The wind load is modeled using parameters from SACS software, with a wind speed of 36.7 m/s and a significant wave height of 12.2 m, both representing the 100-year mean conditions at the site. The wind load direction is aligned with the wave propagation direction to simulate the most critical structural response scenario. The wind load is then distributed across the platform deck in proportion to the corresponding significant irregular wave height considered in the analysis.
Irregular Wave Analysis: In the final step, the structure is subjected to irregular wave conditions through a nonlinear dynamic analysis over 600 s as described in Section 4. The analysis focuses on capturing critical structural responses, including base shear and the displacement of the highest node on the deck. To assess the displacement response across the entire height of the platform, relative story displacements (drifts) are also measured under increasing wave heights. Morison force is calculated and applied instantaneously at 0.1-s intervals, with the structural response data recorded at a fine time step of 0.0005 s. A series of dynamic incremental irregular wave analyses are performed by gradually increasing the significant wave height from 1 m, with 1-m increments, until the platform experiences significant deformation or structural failure. This process is repeated for each platform listed in Table 4, enabling a comparison of the effects of foundation conditions on structural responses and failure modes. Key parameters for load calculations are provided in Table 5.
Table 5. Parameters considered for platform analysis and their values based on site-specific environmental conditions.

Parameter	Value
100-year wind speed (1-min mean)	36.7 (m/s)
Wind load extracted from Inplace Analysis of platform	X-direction	2119 (kN)
Y-direction	17.3 (kN)
Z-direction	2.78 (kN)
100-year wave height (design wave height)	12.2 (m)
100-year current velocity at the water surface	1.1 (m/s)
100-year current velocity at the 0.5 m above seabed	0.4 (m/s)
Thickness of marine growth on radius	75 (mm)
Drag coefficient (
)	1.1
Inertia coefficient (
)	1.2
It should be noted that unidirectional irregular wave loading was used, with wave propagation assumed along the x-axis for the sake of simplicity, as previously mentioned in Section 4. This direction was chosen because it is expected to generate the most significant wave forces on the structure, making it a critical case for evaluating structural response. Future research could extend this study by incorporating multidirectional wave conditions to further assess their impact on structural performance.
5.1. Soil profile effects
The impact of soil profiles on platform responses was evaluated by comparing the dynamic analysis results of each platform subjected to various significant irregular wave heights. As detailed in Table 4 the scenarios “S1-S2”, “S3-S4”, and “S5-S6” involve platforms with identical structural characteristics but differing soil profiles. Fig. 7 presents force-displacement diagrams for these platform pairs under two different irregular wave heights (Hs = 6 m and Hs = 12 m or 14 m), illustrating both linear and nonlinear behaviour. At Hs = 6 m, the response curves are linear for all scenarios. However, at Hs = 12 m and Hs = 14 m, the structures exhibit nonlinear behavior, where platforms on the SP2 soil type showing stiffer responses in the linear phase compared to those on SP1 soil. Table 6 summarizes the structural responses, indicating that at Hs = 6 m, the platforms on SP2 soil type have approximately 1% higher maximum base shear and 21% lower maximum displacements compared to those on SP1. For Hs = 12 m and Hs = 14 m, the SP2 platforms show a 15% increase in maximum base shear and a 46% decrease in maximum displacements relative to SP1 platforms. The base shear and displacement time histories for each platform are documented in Appendix A.

Hs = 12m	19.07	22.24	16.62%	1.797	1.166	−35.11%
S3	S4	Difference (%)	S3	S4	Difference (%)
Hs = 6m	6.2	6.233	0.53%	0.252	0.2	−20.63%

S5	S6	Difference (%)	S5	S6	Difference (%)
Hs = 6m	6.203	6.268	1.05%	0.277	0.218	−21.30%
Hs = 14m	20.81	23.9	14.85%	6.27	2.949	−52.97%
It is important to note that the force-displacement curves, representing the total structural response at each time step, show an initial offset due to the wind effects included in the second step of the analysis. Additionally, platform displacement remains positive, indicating unidirectional movement. This behavior is primarily due to the geometry of the jacket platform, where one side features battered legs for enhanced strength and capacity, while the vertical elements on the opposite side, with lower capacities, yield first. Further, as reported by Stewart and Moan (1993) and Stewart (2017), a few large waves will be generated in an extreme storm, and these may cause damage accumulation in specific part of structure. Consequently, the force-displacement curves demonstrate a one-sided behavior, a phenomenon further illustrated in the time history responses in Appendix A.
5.2. Pile strengthening effects
The effects of pile strengthening on platform responses were investigated by varying both the pile cross-section and the yield stress of the steel material used in the piles. The impact of each variable on the structural responses is discussed in more detail below.
5.2.1. Effects of geometric characteristics of the pile cross-section
To investigate how changes in the cross-sectional area of piles affect the platform responses, both the wall thickness and diameter of the piles were adjusted. Modifying these geometric parameters simultaneously offers a cost-effective method to enhance both the cross-sectional area and the moment of inertia of the piles. Initially, the pile elements had a diameter (
) of 1320 mm and a wall thickness (
) of 55 mm. Adhering to API guidelines, which recommend a minimum gap of 38 mm between the jacket leg and the pile, the maximum feasible diameter for the piles is determined to be 1400 mm, given the internal diameter of the platform legs. Therefore, an alternative pile design was proposed with a diameter of 1400 mm and a wall thickness of 64 mm, resulting in approximately a 30% increase in the plastic moment (
) of the pile's cross-section compared to its original design, as detailed in Table 7.
Table 7. The design variables of the initial and modified pile cross-sections used to study the effects of geometric characteristics of the pile cross-section.

1400	64	21.9	340	0.086	29.2
According to Table 4, the scenarios in which the soil profile remains constant but the pile cross-section varies include “S1-S3” with SP1 soil profile and “S2-S4” with SP2 soil profile. Fig. 8 illustrates the force-displacement diagrams for these platform pairs under two different irregular wave heights (Hs = 6 m and, Hs = 12 m or 14 m), comparing both linear and nonlinear behavior of the platforms. As shown in Fig. 8a and c, the force-displacement curves are linear at Hs = 6 m. In this condition, increasing the pile cross-sectional parameters notably reduces maximum displacement, while the maximum base shear remains relatively unchanged. On the other hand, at Hs = 12 m and Hs = 14 m, the changes in pile geometry lead to significant variations in both maximum displacement and base shear, as shown in Fig. 8b and d, where the platforms experience nonlinear excursions of displacements. Table 8 summarizes the structural responses of the platforms, and time histories of base shear and displacement for each platform are presented in Appendix B.

5.2.2. Effects of mechanical properties of the pile cross-section
The impact of the mechanical properties of the piles on structural responses was assessed by varying the yield stress (
) of the steel material used in the piles. Two yield stress values were considered: 340 MPa and 414 MPa, the latter being the maximum allowable according to API recommendations. Increasing the yield stress of the pile cross-section enhances the plastic moment by 21.8% compared to the initial cross-section, as detailed in Table 9.

According to Table 4, the scenarios in which the soil profile type remains constant, and only the yield stress of the steel material used for the piles differs, include “S1-S5” with SP1 soil profile and “S2-S6” with SP2 soil profile. Fig. 9 displays the force-displacement responses for these platforms under two different irregular wave heights (Hs = 10 m and, Hs = 12 m or 14 m). It should be noted that for wave heights less than 10 m, the behavior of all platforms remains linear, and the results obtained from the analysis of platforms S1 and S5, as well as, S2 and S6 are approximately similar.

At Hs = 10 m, while the platforms behavior is on the verge of the nonlinear region, the differences between the response characteristics of the two platforms are negligible as shown in Fig. 9a and c. On the other hand, comparing the structural responses of the platforms at irregular wave heights that cause nonlinear behavior, a relatively tangible change in results is observed. As shown in Fig. 9b and d, both maximum displacement and base shear change significantly at Hs = 12 m and Hs = 14 m. Table 10 summarizes the structural responses of the platforms, and time histories of base shear and displacement for each platform are provided in Appendix C.

Hs = 14m	23.27	23.9	2.71%	3.444	2.949	−14.37%
5.3. Failure modes of the platforms
The failure modes of a platform can be divided into two main categories: element-level and system-level failures. These modes are influenced by various factors, including the platform's dimensions and configuration, the specifications of structural elements, and the characteristics of the foundation. Common causes of platform failures include the formation of plastic hinges in jacket and pile elements, brace buckling, and foundation instability. In some instances, a combination of these failure modes leads to the complete collapse of the structure. This section examines how foundation characteristics impact the dominant failure modes of jacket platforms.
Fig. 10 presents the dynamic responses of platform models subjected to the maximum significant wave heights they can withstand before experiencing collapse. In Fig. 10a, the pile failure leads to the collapse of the S1 platform. For significant wave heights exceeding 12.25 m, the failure mechanism initiates with formation of plastic hinges at the upper parts of the piles, leading to a reduction in their load-carrying capacity until the pile sections tear. Consequently, when other structural elements can no longer sustain the applied loads, the entire structure collapses.

Fig. 10. Dynamic responses of platform models under the largest significant wave height they can withstand before collapse.

Fig. 10b illustrates the force-displacement responses of the S2 platform, which shares structural characteristics with the S1 platform but differs in soil conditions. The S2 platform can withstand an irregular wave with Hs = 14.5 m, indicating superior performance compared to the S1 platform. Moreover, the nonlinear responses of the S2 platform differ from those of the S1 platform, with failure beginning at a displacement of 1.58 m due to the buckling of compression braces in the first story, significantly diminishing structural capacity. The structure then redistributes the load from failed elements to other components, undergoing several cycles of yielding in various elements. If subjected to a wave height exceeding 14.5 m, significant displacements occur at the top level of the piles due to plastic hinge formation, leading to eventual collapse at a displacement of 7.31 m at the reference node.
Comparing the failure processes of platforms S1 and S2 reveals that a stronger soil foundation alters the platform's failure mode and enhances its structural performance. This is because a failure occurring in the braces, which allows for greater energy absorption and ductility, is preferable to an immediate rupture of the piles. A jacket platform founded on stronger soil not only utilizes the capacities of both the jacket and the foundation more effectively, but also improves the platform's initial stiffness and ultimate strength, resulting in a markedly different failure mechanism.
Given that the jacket part of the platform consists of numerous indeterminate members, it is advantageous for plastic hinges to form in the jacket rather than in the foundation. Increasing the pile's cross-sectional area is one strategy to enforce the transition of failure location from the foundation to the jacket. Fig. 10c depicts the force-displacement responses of the S3 platform, which shares the soil condition of the S1 platform (original platform) but features piles with a different cross-section. The S3 platform withstands an irregular wave with Hs = 14.25 m, showcasing a force-displacement diagram distinctly different from that of the S1 platform. The platform's failure initiates with the buckling of the first story's compression braces at a displacement of 1.60 m at the reference node, followed by failures in the leg elements and horizontal and tensile braces. Exposure to an irregular wave height greater than 14.25 m results in the plastic hinges formation at the top level of the piles, leading to significant displacements and, eventually, the platform's collapse at a displacement of 10.34 m at the reference node. This suggests that increasing the cross-sectional area of the piles results in a more favorable failure mechanism for the platform.
Fig. 10d shows the force-displacement responses of the S4 platform, which shares the structural characteristics of the S3 platform but differs in soil conditions. Although S4 can withstand an irregular wave with Hs = 15.125 m, showcasing better performance than the S3 platform, it follows a similar failure process. Initially, the rupture of the first story's compression braces at a displacement of 1.44 m significantly diminishes the platform's capacity. Subsequently, the structure redistributes the load from damaged elements to other structural components. When subjected to a wave greater than 15.125 m, the S4 platform experiences substantial displacements at the top level of the piles due to plastic hinge formation, and ultimately collapsing at a displacement of 9.35 m at the reference node. Thus, while the stronger soil profile does not change the failure mechanism, it increases the platform's reserved strength and leads to the collapse at higher displacement levels.
Another strategy to prevent plastic hinge formation in the foundation part of the platform is to increase the yield stress of the steel material used in the piles. The S5 platform, having the same soil condition as the S1 platform but with piles yielding at higher stress levels, withstands an irregular wave with Hs = 14.25m. There is a notable difference in the force-displacement diagram between this platform and the S1 platform. The failure process begins with the tearing of the first story's compression braces at a displacement of 1.05 m, followed by failures in the leg elements, horizontal elements, and tensile braces (Fig. 10e). Similar to the S3 platform, when facing a wave height greater than 14.25 m, the S5 platform experiences significant displacements at the top level of the piles, culminating in collapse at a displacement of 9.04 m. Increasing the yield stress of the piles thus yields a preferable failure mechanism.
Fig. 10f illustrates the force-displacement responses of the S6 platform, which differs from the S5 platform only in the soil profile characteristics. Despite the S6 platform withstands an irregular wave with Hs = 15 m—indicating better performance than the S5 platform—it fails in a manner similar to the S5 platform. The rupture of the first story braces occurs at a displacement of 1.34 m, leading to collapse at a displacement of 9.29 m due to the plastic hinge formation at the pile tops. Here again, a stronger soil profile does not alter the failure mechanism but does increase the platform's reserved strength and collapse threshold.
The summary of the failure modes and the calculated Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) for each platform is provided in Table 11. The RSR represents the ratio between the design base shear (based on a 100-year return period wave in the Persian Gulf with Hs = 6.6 m) and the ultimate strength (base shear) that the platform can sustain before experiencing collapse.

5.4. Floors relative displacement
Fig. 11 depicts the maximum interstory drift (relative displacement) for all platforms under high levels of irregular wave action, where nonlinear deformation occurs within the platform structures. All curves exhibit a series of successive "softening" and "hardening" phases. This phenomenon occur as a consequence of the dynamic nature of wave loads as well as the various response characteristics exhibited by the structures when subjected to irregular waves with different significant wave heights.

Fig. 11. Maximum interstory drifts of S1 to S6 platforms.

As shown in Fig. 11a, the maximum relative displacement for the S1 platform occurs at the fifth floor. However, for the other platforms (S2 to S6), the maximum relative displacement is observed at the first (lowest) jacket floor. This finding aligns with the previous discussion on failure modes, where the initial failure in platforms S2 to S6 occurs at the first floor, preceding the failure of the piles.
5.5. Incremental irregular wave analysis curves
This section provides a brief overview of the dynamic incremental irregular wave analysis results for all platforms, with a focus on generating curves that illustrate the relationship between key response parameters and wave intensity levels. These capacity curves are crucial for comprehending the structural behavior of the platforms as wave heights increase progressively. To derive these curves, two essential parameters must be defined: the Intensity Measure (IM) and the Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP). In this context, the Intensity Measure (IM) is represented by the significant wave height, which quantifies the severity of wave action exerted on the platform. The Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) captures the structural response to this wave action, specifically reflected as the maximum base shear and the displacement of the highest node on the deck.
During the dynamic incremental irregular wave analysis, the structural model is subjected to a sequence of incrementally increasing significant wave heights. For each wave height, a nonlinear dynamic analysis is performed, during which the structural demand parameters are meticulously recorded. The analysis continues until the platform reaches a critical point, characterized by significant deformation or failure, beyond which the platform can no longer withstand the wave loading. This critical point, marked by an abrupt change in the slope of the response curves, indicates the platform's limit state or potential collapse point.
As illustrated in Fig. 12, the platforms exhibit linear behavior under smaller wave heights, transitioning to nonlinear behavior as the wave heights increase. Fig. 12a depicts the maximum base shear versus significant wave heights for each platform, indicating that beyond a certain significant wave height, changes in maximum base shear become negligible. Fig. 12b shows the displacement of the highest node relative to the significant wave height, with a sharp increase in maximum displacement after a certain wave height, signaling the onset of a failure mechanism in the platforms. Fig. 12c presents the trend of maximum base shear against the highest node of deck displacements for all platform cases. A summary of these results is provided in Table 12.

6. Comparison between incremental dynamic analysis results and pushover analysis results
This section details the nonlinear static (pushover) analysis conducted on platforms S1 to S6 using OpenSees software and compares these results with those from the incremental dynamic analysis. As outlined in Section 4, performing wave analyses in OpenSees requires the inclusion of specific commands to facilitate the accurate application of loads on the platform. In the pushover analysis, wave loading is modeled as a lateral load pattern, with the Morison wave forces calculated based on the kinematics derived from Stokes' 5th-order wave theory and uniformly applied to all structural elements. The treatment of current and wind loads in the pushover analysis mirrors the approach used in the dynamic analysis.
The pushover analysis is conducted in three stages. The first stage involves applying gravity loads to the model and performing a linear static analysis. In the second stage, wind loads are applied, followed by a quasi-static analysis. The final stage consists of conducting the pushover analysis in the X-direction, which is more likely to represent the worst-case scenario for the platform's structural response. This analysis is performed for the significant wave height corresponding to the onset of collapse, as identified by the incremental dynamic analysis. The lateral displacement of the platform's reference node, which is the highest node on the deck, is incrementally increased by 0.0005-m intervals until the platform reaches collapse.
Following the pushover analysis, a comparative assessment is made with the incremental dynamic analysis results. Fig. 13 illustrates this comparison, showing a strong correlation between the force-displacement curves from both methods. This similarity underscores the consistency in the failure mechanisms observed across the analyses. The ultimate capacities, defined as the maximum base shear values, obtained from both analyses, are summarized in Table 13.

Platform	Maximum Base Shear (MN)	Difference.%
Pushover Analysis	Dynamic Analysis
S1	19.3	19.1	1.1%
S2	23.1	23.2	0.56%
S3	21.3	21.3	0.28%
S4	24.1	24.4	1.11%
S5	20.8	20.8	0.19%
S6	23.7	23.9	1.13%
It is noteworthy that since all platforms exhibited one-sided behavior during the dynamic analysis with no significant harmonic response observed, the agreement between the pushover analysis and dynamic analysis results confirms the validity of the dynamic analysis methodology provided in this study.
7. Summary and closing remarks
This paper utilized dynamic incremental irregular wave analysis to investigate the influence of foundation conditions on the performance of jacket-type offshore platforms, focusing on a reference structure located in the Persian Gulf. Six distinct platform models were developed in OpenSees, varying the soil type of the foundation, the geometric and mechanical properties of the piles. These finite element models comprehensively accounted for soil-pile-structure interactions, the nonlinear behavior of the piles, and both global buckling and post-buckling responses of the braces. The modeling of irregular wave effects was achieved using the Airy wave theory and Morison equation in OpenSees. It is noteworthy that this study utilized unidirectional irregular wave loading; future research could extend this work by incorporating multidirectional wave conditions to further assess their impact on structural performance.
The primary goal was to assess the ultimate strength and failure modes of the different models to understand the impact of various foundation system parameters. Additionally, nonlinear static analysis (pushover) was conducted on these platforms as for comparison purposes and to validate the results obtained from the dynamic analysis.
While this study involved modifying the properties along the entire length of the piles, such extensive changes are not always necessary. Future research could examine the efficacy of partially strengthening the piles, specifically at locations where plastic hinges are likely to form, to optimize structural reinforcement.
From the models and assumptions utilized in this study, the following key insights can be derived:
•
The maximum dynamic response of the platform to irregular wave forces is influenced by residual effects from previous lower-height waves, which are retained within the structure's "memory." Consequently, the peak response may not always coincide with the occurrence of the highest wave.
•
Enhancing the soil profile beneath the platform and reinforcing the piles significantly improves structural performance by achieving a balance between the jacket's strength and the foundation's strength. Among the various scenarios tested, the best performance was observed when both the cross-sectional area of the piles was increased and the soil characteristics were improved, enabling the platform to withstand greater wave heights. Conversely, adjusting the mechanical properties of the piles, such as increasing the yield stress of the steel, had minimal impact on the structural responses.
•
Platform failure typically occurs due to the formation of plastic hinges in the upper sections of the piles, especially when the jacket's strength exceeds that of the foundation.
•
Strengthening the platform's piles alters the failure mechanism, leading to brace buckling prior to the formation of plastic hinges in the piles. Given the high redundancy of the jacket structure, the load from compromised braces is redistributed among other jacket elements, allowing the platform to continue bearing loads. Balancing the strengths of both the foundation and the jacket, enhances the platform's and allows for more effective utilization of its combined load-bearing capacity.
