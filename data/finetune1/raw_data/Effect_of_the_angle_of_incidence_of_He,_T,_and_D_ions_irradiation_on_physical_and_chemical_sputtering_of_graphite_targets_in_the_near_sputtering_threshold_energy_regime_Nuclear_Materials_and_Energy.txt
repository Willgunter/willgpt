Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation-based investigation into the angle of incidence dependence of physical and chemical sputtering of graphite targets irradiated by He+, T+, and D+ ions in the near-threshold energy regime. This investigation has been executed by utilizing two advanced simulation codes, RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP. In this study, we assess sputtering yields and energy thresholds across incidence angles ranging from 0° to 80°. Results indicate that physical sputtering yields are maximized at grazing angles (60°–80°), accompanied by a systematic decrease in sputtering threshold energy with increasing angle. In contrast, chemical sputtering, modeled for T+ and D+ ions, reveals a two-step threshold behavior: an initial erosion onset at ∼ 5 eV, and a secondary enhancement between 8–13 eV driven by physical displacement effects. Which also was found to influence the angle og incidence dependence of the chemical sputtering. Thereby, to physical sputtering, chemical erosion exhibits a peak at intermediate angles (60°–70°). These findings offer key insights into the erosion mechanisms of plasma-facing components and support the optimized design of carbon-based materials for future nuclear fusion reactor applications.

1. Introduction
Graphite (in its pyrolytic form) is one of the candidate materials to serve as a plasma-facing material (PFM) in the future fusion device [[1], [2], [3]]. Perhaps the most important material properties that put graphite in this position are its superior melting point [4,5], reasonable thermal conductivity, and its low atomic number [3]. Under the extreme conditions of normal fusion device operations, PFMs are expected to be subjected to high heat loads and intense neutrons and gamma-ray radiations in addition to continuous bombardment of energetic atoms/ions that consist of both fuel ions species (Deuterium and tritium) and fusion products species (Helium, Lithium, and Beryllium isotopes, etc.) [1,[6], [7], [8]]. These extreme conditions are expected to subject the plasma-facing graphite to various levels of erosion [7]. The various elements of such an extreme environment can include thermal elements (that cause evaporation due to excessive surface temperature), mechanical elements (that cause physical sputtering due to kinematic atomic collisions), or chemical elements (that cause erosion due to the formation of volatile phases as a results of chemical reaction with the readily available hydrogen isotopes) [4,7]. These elements might work separately or collectively to create a level of erosion that might threaten the consideration of graphite as a PFM at all [9]. However, contrary to that point of view, graphitic PFM can be advantageous compared to other candidate materials despite its fearsome erosion level [3]. For instance, graphite raw materials (carbon) are abundant in nature, and also, graphite is cheap and easy to manufacture, and its manufacturing has a considerably lower carbon dioxide footprint compared to other candidate materials. Moreover, as a low-Z material, carbon material debris makes less of a threat to the temperature of the fusion device plasma compared to other high-Z candidate PFMs [3]. The fact that high-Z metal debris compromises the stability of the plasma in future fusion devices can be further implicated by the susceptibility of such materials to form fragile nanostructure (fuzz) when exposed to helium plasma [8,10]. Such a vulnerable structure can be easily washed out from the PFM surfaces to the core of the plasma during the events of plasma disruption or ELMs [10]. However, not only was graphite found to be immune to such a phenomenon, but the presence of carbon in helium plasma was found to actively mitigate the formation of fuzz on exposed tungsten structures [11]. Therefore, the presence of graphite PFM along with tungsten in the future fusion devise might be the solution for the fuzz formation that plagues high-Z metals in the future fusion devices [11].
This study is an attempt to shed more light on the chemical and physical erosion (sputtering) of graphite targets bombarded by different ion species that comprise the most abundant ion species in the nuclear fusion plasma. The main aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the angle of incidence on both types of sputtering in the near sputtering energy threshold of the incident energy range.
2. Simulation methods and parameters
Two different simulation programs were used in this study, RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP. RDS-BASIC is a Monte-Carlo-based simulation program that was specifically designed to provide the highest level of accuracy that the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) can offer in low-energy ion irradiation cases [12]. RDS-BASIC simulation program features a detailed numerical solution for the classical scattering integral and uses a unique surface atomic displacement model that recognizes the relative ease of sputtering atoms in the surface top monolayer compared to the underlying layers [12]. Moreover, the model also recognizes the variation of the atomic displacement threshold of the atoms in the top surface monolayer in response to their emission direction with respect to the surface normal [12]. A detailed description of the RDS-BASIC simulation program is available in a recently published paper [12]. Also, several studies concerning low energy ions irradiation used the RDS-BASIC simulation program, and its results were also compared with other popular simulation programs [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]].
The RDS-BASIC simulations of this study were complemented by the use of SDTrimSP (ver. 6.05). The SDTrimSP is a well-known MC simulation program that also uses binary collision approximation as a basis for calculating the outcomes of radiation (ions) interaction with matter. The program was specifically developed to simulate various phenomena associated with the ions' interaction with condensed matter [18,19]. The biggest advantages of this simulation program are its capability of performing both dynamic (similar to TRIDYN) and static (similar to TRIM) calculations in addition to its capability of accounting for the chemical erosion that is associated with hydrogen isotopes irradiation on the various morphs of carbon and carbon compounds [19,20]. This latter important characteristic of the SDTrimSP simulation program was essential for performing the chemical erosion study of this investigation. In this study, in all of the cases where reactive ion irradiation on a graphite target was simulated using the SDTrimSP simulation program (T, D ions), the fully dynamic mode of SDTrimSP was selected. This was necessary to accurately model the chemical sputtering process, as the dynamic mode accounts for the implantation of incident ions and the resulting evolution of the near-surface target stoichiometry, which significantly influences the calculated sputtering yields of both types (physical and chemical). However, in these irradiation cases, the distinction between physical and chemical sputtering is made by looking at the form of sputtered target atoms. If sputtered target atoms leave the surface in their atomic form, these atoms will be counted as physically sputtered and hence will contribute to the physical sputtering yield. Conversely, if the carbon atom leaves the surface in the form of hydrocarbons, it will be counted as chemically sputtered.
While RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP share certain conceptual foundations, they differ considerably in scope and implementation. RDS-BASIC is designed to be simple and directly represent the binary collision theory with minimal assumptions and the highest computational accuracy. It is also made to utilize a numerical solution for the classical scattering integral, which is also a common feature with the SDTrimSP (despite the differences between the two programs in the specific numerical integration and root-finding methods that each program utilizes). A key innovation in RDS-BASIC is its implementation of a reduced displacement energy threshold (Ed) for surface atoms, which varies with recoil angle, enhancing accuracy in low-energy ion irradiation near the sputtering threshold. In contrast, SDTrimSP is a complex simulation program that offers flexibility in choosing between various calculation approaches and surface binding models, etc. Also, SDTrimSP does not explicitly reduce Ed for surface atoms; SDTrimSP can compute sputtering yields without enforcing the displacement-energy threshold (Ed) during the cascade, which allows it to reproduce realistic sputtering yields but leads to an overestimation of displacement damage. To address this, SDTrimSP performs an additional calculation that applies the Ed condition to obtain more accurate radiation-damage predictions, while retaining the Ed-free results for sputtering yields.
In terms of performance, RDS-BASIC is slower due to its reliance on numerical methods, whereas SDTrimSP is optimized for efficiency, making it more practical for large-scale simulations. Additionally, SDTrimSP supports mixed materials and dynamic composition changes, broadening its applicability compared to RDS-BASIC, which is limited to pure, amorphous targets and only performs a fully static mode of calculations. The main simulation parameters that fed into the two simulation programs are presented in Table 1.

3. Results and discussion
Various simulation runs attempt to simulate the graphite bombardment by various incident ion species (He, T, and D). For each of these different irradiation systems, the ion's incident energy and angle of incidence were varied. The kinetic energy range of incident ions is selected to be around the physical sputtering energy threshold Eth value for each irradiation system. Also, the range of angle of incidence is selected to span the range from 0° (right angle) to 80° (very grazing angle). The whole set of studied cases was simulated separately by both of the simulation programs and reported below. Due to the difference in the simulation time between the two simulation programs, the ion sample size (number of ions for each simulation run) was chosen differently. The ion sample size for the SDTrimSP simulation program was chosen to be 106 ions, and the RDS-BASICS ions number was selected to be 105 ions. The simulation results for both simulation programs are presented in the following subsections.
3.1. Physical sputtering
Unlike chemical erosion (chemical sputtering), physical sputtering due to ion irradiation affects all of our studied irradiation cases. The results here are presented in different figures for each of the studied irradiation systems and are presented separately for each of the two simulation programs. The angle and energy of incidence dependence of the sputtering yield data for the He+ ions irradiating graphite targets, performed by the two simulation programs, are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The sputtering yields versus the incident He ions energy taken at various angles of incidence (according to RDS-BASIC) are presented in Fig. 1a. Here, the sputtering yield values in the near sputtering threshold energy range were found to be affected by the change in the angle of incidence. First and foremost, there is an obvious variation in the sputtering energy threshold Eth values for different angles of incidence. Also, the angle of incidence dependence of the sputtering yield values was found to behave differently at different ranges of energy of incidence. For instance, in the higher incident energy part of the data (at incident ion energy Eo higher than 35 eV), the higher angle of incidence seems to give higher sputtering yield values. Therefore, in this slightly higher energy range, the angle of incidence that is found to give the maximum sputtering yields is 80°. However, in the lower energy side (Eo < 35 eV), the highest sputtering yield values were maximized at lower angles of incidence. To shed more light on this phenomenon, the data of Fig. 1a is rearranged to be in the form of sputtering yield versus angle of incidence curves, whereas each curve is devoted to a single incident energy. These newly arranged data are presented in Fig. 1b. Here, angles of incidence that give the maximum sputtering yield are shifted toward a lower angle of incidence when the energy of incident ions decreases and approaches the sputtering energy threshold. This variation in sputtering yields at the lower incident energy side can be linked with the variation of the sputtering energy threshold Eth values that vary with the variation of the irradiation angle of incidence.

The SDTrimSP’s simulation results for the physical sputtering of carbon atoms (graphite target) by He+ ions’ irradiation are presented in Fig. 2. The sputtering yield values versus He+ ions kinetic energy taken at various angles of incidence are presented in Fig. 2a, whereas the rearranged data in the form of sputtering yield versus angle of incidence are presented in Fig. 2b. Here, according to SDTrimSP simulation results, both sputtering yield values and sputtering energy threshold values seem to be also vary with the variation of the angle of incidence in a way that is similar to the RDS-BASIC simulation results. However, the sputtering energy threshold values have now shifted toward much lower values (around 14 eV in the case of normal angle of incidence θ = 0°) compared to the sputtering yield values extracted from the RDS-BASIC simulation results (around 24 eV at θ = 0°). This contrasting difference in the normal incidence Eth values between the two simulation programs is due to different reasons. In part, it is due to the fundamental difference between the two simulation programs in the way they carry out their calculation procedure (for example, the dependence/independence on the Ed as explained in the simulation methods and parameters section). Such a distinctive discrepancy in results is found to be evident in many irradiation systems [12,14,16,17]. The other contributing reason for the variation in the Eth values is the choice of the target materials' parameters, especially the surface binding energy Es. The scientifically most accepted value for Es is 7.41 eV. Therefore, adopted in the RDS-BASIC simulation program. On the other hand, the SDTrimSP developing team has recommended the choice of adjusted (calibrated) Es value of 4.5 eV for carbon so that the results will better match experimental data, especially in the chemical sputtering process [20]. However, this discrepancy in the normal incidence Eth values between the two simulation programs will also be encountered in the Tritium/Deuterium irradiation cases, as will be seen in the next paragraphs.
Moreover, for SDTrimSP simulation results, the angle of incidence that gives the maximum sputtering yield values is now constant for all energies of incidence and is now situated at 60°. The prediction of the angle of maximum sputtering yield by SDTrimSP (at ∼ 60°) is found to be in excellent agreement with the Eckstein mathematical model for the angular dependence of physical sputtering [24]. For example, if we take the incident ions' energy of 50 eV He+ ions bombarding a carbon target, Eckstein model calculations yield the angle maximum spurting at 62.85° [25]. The variation in the angle of incidence that gives the maximum sputtering between the two simulation programs results is well understood and is mainly attributed to the percentage of backscattered ions for each case. SDTrimSP generally predicts a higher amount of backscattered ions at a grazing angle of incidence compared to RDS-BASIC. Therefore, SDTrimSP results in much lower sputtering yield values at a grazing angle of incidence. The contrasting sputtering yield predictions of RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP at grazing incidence (70-80°) arise from fundamental differences in their treatment of ion-surface interactions and collision cascades. The default parameter of SDTrimSP (x0 = 0) initiates projectiles outside the target surface (typically at 2pmax ≈ 1.128λ, where λ is the mean free path and pmax is the maximum impact parameter) [26], which creates a profound ions’ scattering at grazing angles [27]. As ions approach the surface obliquely, their trajectories undergo multiple soft collisions (small-angle scattering) with surface atoms due to the extended maximum impact parameter implementation. These collisions progressively deflect ions away from the surface while dissipating kinetic energy through electronic stopping, resulting in the increased backscattering probability. This surface ions’ scattering mechanism produces the characteristic steep yield reduction at grazing angles of incidence. In contrast, RDS-BASIC's projectile initialization at the target surface bypasses this pre-surface scattering regime. Ions immediately experience a higher chance for hard collisions (large momentum transfer) within the target bulk.
The variation of the sputtering energy thresholds at various angles of incidence for He+ ions irradiating graphite targets according to both of the simulation programs is presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen in this figure both simulation programs predicted a reduction in the values of sputtering energy threshold Eth as the angle of incidence increases (ions irradiation directions decline from the surface normal direction). RDS-BASIC simulation results show a systematic and steep decline of the Eth values down to its minimum value of 18 eV at an angle of incidence of 40° (lost 25 % of its original normal incidence Eth value) before it increases back with a lower and steady rate at higher angles of incidence which continue to the very grazing angle of incidence of 80° at which the Eth value for this irradiation system was found to be at around 20 eV. On the other hand, SDTrimSP simulation results show a narrower and less prominent declination of the Eth values upon increasing the angle of incidence. For instance, only a total of 2 eV of decrease in the Eth value when it reaches its minimum value of 12 eV, which happened at an angle of incidence between 30° and 40°. Then, the Eth value was found to be slightly increased (by only 1 eV) at higher angles of incidence.

The next irradiation cases are rather different because they contain reactive gases irradiation compared to the previous case of He+ ions irradiation. However, in this section, we will only consider the effect of physical sputtering, and the chemical sputtering of these irradiation cases will be discussed separately in the next section. Therefore, sputtering yield data of graphite irradiated by tritium ions according to RDS-BASIC simulation results are presented in Fig. 4, which shows a general variation in sputtering yield and sputtering energy threshold values for various angles of incidence. Also, similar to the previous case, the angle of incidence that gives the maximum sputtering yield was found to be constant at 80° in the case of higher incident energy while seems to be shifted toward lower angles when the energy of incident ions is approaching the sputtering energy threshold value as can be seen in Fig. 4b. For this irradiation system, the normal incidence (θ = 0°) Eth value was found to be at 21 eV. Increasing the angle of incidence causes a significant increase in the sputtering yield values and a few electron volts decrease in the Eth values compared to their respective normal incidence values.

Similar results were also confirmed by the SDTrimSP simulation results, as shown in Fig. 5. However, the amount of variation of the Eth value upon varying the angle of incidence is less prominent. Furthermore, SDTrimSP simulation results suggest a normal incidence (θ = 0°) Eth value of about 13 eV. Also, the angle of incidence at which the maximum sputtering yield is attained seems to be this time constant at 70°. This angle of maximum sputtering yield is found to agree with the Eckstein mathematical model for the angular dependence of physical sputtering [24]. For example, if we take the incident ions' energy of 50 eV T+ ions bombarding a carbon target, Eckstein model calculations yield the angle maximum spurting at 66.04° [25].

A more careful view of the actual Eth values of the sputtering energy threshold at different angles of incidence is presented in Fig. 6 for RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP simulation results. RDS-BASIC program simulation results suggest an initial decrease of the sputtering energy threshold upon increasing the angle of incidence until it reaches its minimum value of 18 eV, which occurs at an angle of incidence of 40°. Departing this angle of minimal Eth value toward higher angles results in a gradual increase in the Eth value to reach 20 eV at a very grazing angle of incidence. On the other hand, SDTrimSP simulation results suggest a constant Eth value of 13 eV in the angles of incidence range between 0° and 40° then, followed by a 1 eV drop in the Eth value (to reach the value of 12 eV) that is also found to be constant across the angles of incidence range between 50° and 80°.

The effect of the angle of incidence on the physical sputtering of graphite irradiated by deuterium ions was also studied and simulated by both RDS-BASIC and SDTrimSP simulation programs. The sputtering yield data in the near sputtering energy threshold regime are presented for both simulation programs in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. Similar to the previous irradiation cases, RDS-BASIC simulation results show variations in sputtering yield and sputtering energy threshold in response to the variation in the angle of incidence. Moreover, the sputtering energy threshold for normal incidence irradiation is found to be at 27 eV and tends to decrease to a lower value for a higher angle of incidence. Also, the angle of incidence that gives the highest sputtering yield is found to be consistent at 80° when the incident ion energy is greater than 50 eV. However, this angle of maximum sputtering tends to shift toward lower angles when the incident ions' kinetic energy is reduced below 50 eV, as seen in Fig. 7b.

SDTrimSP simulation results also confirm the effect of varying the angle of incidence on both sputtering yield and sputtering energy threshold for this irradiation system as shown in Fig. 8a. However, one major difference between the results of the two simulation programs is that SDTrimSP suggests the Eth value for this irradiation system at 15 eV. Also, the SDTrimSP simulation program suggests that the angle of incidence that causes the maximum sputtering is constant at 70°, as can be seen in Fig. 8b.
The actual changes in Eth values as a function of irradiation angle for this irradiation system are presented in Fig. 9. Similar to the previous cases, RDS-BASIC program simulation results suggest an initial decrease in the Eth value from 27 eV at normal incidence down to 23 eV that occurs at an angle of incidence between 40° and 50° which is followed by slight increase (only 1 eV) in the Eth values at higher angles of incidence. On the other hand, SDTrimSP simulation results predicted a similar gradual decrease of the Eth value by increasing the angle of incidence of up to 40° which gives the minimum Eth value of about 12 eV. Further increase in the angle of incidence results in an increase in the Eth value.

3.2. Chemical sputtering
Chemical sputtering is the loss of target atoms in the form of volatile phases as a result of chemical reactions between the incident ions and target atoms. Therefore, deuterium and tritium ions are capable of producing chemical bonding with the carbon atoms of the target, and hence, the newly formed volatile hydrocarbon phases can be relatively easily removed or desorbed from the target surface during the course of ions’ bombardment. For this part of the study, only the SDTrimSP simulation program is capable of simulating the needed chemical sputtering effect. Therefore, RDS-BASIC was excluded from this part of the study. However, the SDTrimSP results represent a simplified BCA-based estimate of chemical erosion, not a comprehensive simulation of the underlying chemical kinetics.
From a theoretical standpoint, chemical sputtering has a lower sputtering energy threshold than physical sputtering. The only requirement for the incident ions to participate in a chemical erosion process is to carry enough energy (momentum) to break the C–C bonds of graphite. The existence of these dangling broken bonds in a hydrogen-isotope-saturated graphite lattice will create a reactive environment that encourages the formation of C–H bonding and drastically causes the restructuring of the graphite lattice's top monolayers. The rate of H-C bond formation depends on the density of hydrogen isotopes in the lattice, the rate of kinetic energy deposition, and the creation of the collision cascade during the ions’ bombardment. All of these factors are expected to be maximized at the target surface. This process is expected to continue until a separable hydrocarbon molecule that is loosely bonded to the graphite surface is formed and then desorbed into the vacuum. SDTrimSP calculates chemical erosion by explicitly modeling three carbon hybridization states sp2 (graphitic), sp3 (tetrahedral), and sph3 (hydrogen-bonded sp3), and their dynamic interconversions driven by ion irradiation [19,20]. The simulation initiates transformations between these states based on specific energy criteria: an incident ion transferring ≥ 3.6 eV to an sp2 carbon breaks its double bond, converting it to sp3. Implanted hydrogen atoms passivate available sp3 sites to form sph3, constrained by an upper limit of H/C ≤ 1/3; excess hydrogen triggers reversion (sph3 → sp3). Crucially, the total concentration of sp3-hybridized carbon (sp3 + sph3) is dynamically regulated against temperature-dependent reference values derived from the Mech model [28], enforcing state changes (e.g., sph3 → sp2) if limits are exceeded. The chemical erosion yield combines two depth-resolved components: a kinetic yield calculated per layer as the minimum of bond-breaking and hydrogen implantation yields, scaled by desorption to vacuum or in-depth diffusion probabilities, and a thermal yield adapted from the Mech model but adjusted for flux dependence using Roth’s formalism [4,29] and similarly scaled by depth-dependent release. Surface binding energies are set to 4.50 eV for both sp2 and sp3 in hydrogenated carbon, distinct from pure graphite (7.37 eV), to match experimental chemical sputtering data. [20].
The effect of the angle of incidence on the chemical sputtering process is the theme of this part of the study. The chemical erosion of graphite by deuterium and tritium ions was simulated repeatedly at various incident energies and various angles of incidence. The results for the chemical erosion yield of tritium bombarding graphite target are presented in Fig. 10. As can be seen in this figure, the chemical erosion process shows a strong dependence on the angle of incidence, a behavior that seems to be similar to the physical sputtering process in the higher kinetic energy side (Eo > 30 eV) where the chemical erosion found to be maximized at an angle of incidence of 70° with the amount of erosion that is nearly double the amount of normal-incidence erosion. Departing this angle to a higher angle of incidence (80°) results in a drastic decrease in the chemical sputtering. However, in contrast with the physical sputtering process, the chemical erosion process has shown a tendency to decrease by increasing the incident ions' energy above 40 eV.

Chemical sputtering-yield data of the T + ions bombarding graphite targets according to SDTrimSP simulation results. a) shows the kinetic energy dependence of sputtering yield curves taken at various angles of incidence. b) shows a magnification of the lower left corner of the data presented in a).

Furthermore, the chemical erosion energy threshold, as seen in the lower energy side of Fig. 10 shows a very interesting stepped threshold phenomenon. The actual chemical erosion process could not be detected at any incident ion energy below 5 eV. Therefore, 5 eV can be considered as the actual chemical sputtering energy threshold for this irradiation process. Moreover, at any incident ions energy that is slightly higher than the 5 eV threshold, the rate of chemical erosion was found to be in a linear relationship with the incident ions energy as can be seen clearly in Fig. 10b. This figure is basically a magnified version of the data presented in the lower left corner of Fig. 10a. Also, as it can be seen in the same figure and is more clearly in Fig. 11, the chemical sputtering process is found to be in a straight forward relationship with the angle of incidence (i.e. the higher the angle of incidence leads to a higher chemical erosion). However, these direct proportionalities are found to be only valid in the incident ion energies range between 5 eV and 13 eV where at this higher energy a second threshold appears to exist. Above this second threshold (13 eV), the amount of chemical erosion was found to be enhanced by a factor of 3 compared to their values just below this threshold as shown in Fig. 10a.

Furthermore, above the second threshold at 13 eV, the angle of incidence dependence of the chemical erosion process was found to be remarkably distinctive from the dependence found before the threshold as described in the paragraph above and as shown in Fig. 11. Here, the amount of chemical erosion is found to be maximized at an angle of incidence between 60° and 70° depending on the incident ions energy. This behavior is very close in resemblance to the physical sputtering and appears in an incident ions energy range where the physical sputtering process is active. It is worthwhile to mention that the second threshold for chemical erosion (at 13 eV) coincides with the physical sputtering energy threshold. This observation leads us to visualize that the sudden enhancement in chemical erosion at the second threshold could be nothing but the impact of the physical sputtering process on the actual mechanism of chemical erosion. Above the physical sputtering threshold, ion irradiation is expected to create actual atomic displacements. Each displaced atom has to be moved from its lattice site by breaking all of its bonds with neighboring atoms and therefore creating free carbon atoms that have 4 unsaturated bonds, which can be reacted readily with any atoms of the new lattice site. However, in a lattice that is saturated with hydrogen isotope atoms, most of these unsaturated bonds can be fulfilled by the creation of C–H bonds. Hence, chemical erosion can be greatly stimulated above the physical sputtering threshold. Despite this reliance between the two types of sputtering, the two types of sputtering were found to behave differently in terms of their dependence on incident ions energy. The amount of chemical sputtering seemed to be maximized at an energy of incidence of about 35 eV. Increasing the incident ion's kinetic energy results in a gradual decline in the amount of chemical sputtering. On the other hand, physical sputtering is known to increase drastically with the increase in incident ion energy in this low incident energy range. The reason behind this gradual decrease in chemical sputtering is believed to be due to the gradual increase in the range of incident ions inside the target depth, which reduces the chance of the formation of volatile hydrocarbons at the target surface and hence, reduces the amount of carbon atoms removal in the form of hydrocarbons.
The angle of incidence dependence of the chemical erosion behavior of the deuterium on graphite irradiation system has shown some similarity to the previous tritium irradiation case, as shown in Fig. 12. This time, the amount of chemical erosion is found to be maximized at an angle of incidence of 60°. At this angle, the amount of erosion is found to be nearly 170 % higher than the amount of erosion at normal incidence, as shown in Fig. 12a. The true chemical erosion energy threshold has been found to be at 5 eV, which is valid for all of the studied different angles of incidence. Also, in what appears as a second threshold phenomenon, an abrupt increase in the amount of chemical erosion has been observed when increasing the incident deuterium ions' energy above 8 eV.

Fig. 12. Chemical sputtering-yield data of the D + ions bombarding graphite targets according to SDTrimSP simulation results. a) shows the kinetic energy dependence of sputtering yield curves taken at various angles of incidence. b) shows a magnification of the lower left corner of the data presented in a).

Moreover, at incident ions energies below this second threshold (8 eV), the amount of chemical erosion was found to be significantly lower and also less responsive to the increase in incident ions energy if we compare it to the chemical erosion that occurs above the second threshold as can be seen in Fig. 12b. Also, The difference in angle of incidence dependence below and above the second threshold is clearly repeating the same phenomenon we described for the previous irradiation system, which is demonstrated in Fig. 13.

Fig. 13. Angle of incidence dependence of the chemical sputtering yield of the D + ions bombarding graphite targets according to SDTrimSP simulation results. The different sputtering yield curves are taken at various ion's kinetic energy.

Combining both types of sputtering (physical and chemical) for reactive irradiation systems such as D+ and T+ ions on graphite targets, yields the total erosion (Total sputtering yield). As we mentioned earlier, chemical sputtering has a dominant effect on the total sputtering in the low energy of incidence due to its lower energy threshold compared to physical sputtering; however, the amount of chemical sputtering has a weak dependence on the incident ion's kinetic energy and tends to decrease when increasing the incident ion's energy above 40 eV. Meanwhile, physical sputtering has a much stronger dependence and seems to increase drastically in the higher kinetic energy range of the incident ions. Both the incident energy and angle of incidence dependence of the amount of total sputtering are presented in Fig. 14 for D+ and T+ irradiation on graphite targets. For the sake of comparison, and to increase the level of confidence in our simulation results, we added to Fig. 14b data from an MD simulation investigation done by J. Marian et al. [30]. In this investigation total carbon erosion yield was determined for deuterium bombarding a-C:D target at 300 K target temperature and normal angle of incidence. These MD simulation results are found to agree marginally with our total sputtering yield values for normal incidence irradiation, as can be seen in Fig. 14b.

Fig. 14. SDTrimSP simulation results for total sputtering yield (physical + chemical) for the T+ on graphite irradiation system (a), and D+ on graphite irradiation system (b). The different sputtering yield curves (data points) are taken at various angles of incidence. The simulated range of “pure” physical sputtering yield (dashed lines) is superimposed for direct comparison. Data from ref [30]is added to (b) for comparison.

Also, to better clarify the contribution of physical sputtering in the total sputtering yield curves, added to Fig. 14 are curves (dashed lines) that represent the range that the amount of pure physical sputtering may fall within when the angle of incidence is varied. As can be seen for both irradiation systems, the amount of total sputtering is almost identical to the amount of pure physical sputtering when the energy of incidence is greater than 55 eV. Therefore, even though chemical sputtering may pose a threat on the lower energy side of the data, the same chemical sputtering can be considered negligible on the higher energy side.
These results demonstrate that the operational lifetime of graphite plasma-facing components (PFCs) in future fusion reactors will be critically governed by the pronounced angular and energy dependence of both physical and chemical sputtering yields. Our simulations reveal that non-uniform erosion is inevitable, with both chemical and physical sputtering yields maximized at incidence angles (60°- 80°); such localized peak erosion rates threaten accelerated thinning in high-flux regions like divertor targets. Crucially, chemical sputtering dominates at low incident energies (initial threshold ∼ 5 eV), characteristic of divertor plasma conditions, and exhibits a significant enhancement by a factor of ∼ 3 above a secondary threshold (8–13 eV for D+; 13 eV for T+), where physical displacement processes generate reactive carbon sites. This mutual reinforcement of erosion mechanisms maximizes total erosion yields within the low-to-intermediate energy regime (up to ∼ 55 eV). While graphite offers the significant advantage of immunity to helium-induced nanostructuring (unlike high-Z alternatives such as tungsten), its erosion rate remains highly sensitive to incident ion parameters.
4. Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the angle of incidence significantly influences both physical and chemical sputtering of graphite targets under low-energy irradiation by He, T, and D ions. The simulations reveal that physical sputtering yields are maximized at grazing angles (60°–80°), while the sputtering energy threshold decreases as the angle increases, reaching its lowest value at intermediate angles. Chemical sputtering, which occurs only for T and D ions, exhibits a two-threshold behavior: an initial threshold at 5 eV is required for bond breaking, and a secondary threshold (8–13 eV) where physical displacement processes enhance chemical erosion. Between the two thresholds (in the case of only chemical sputtering is active), carbon erosion was found to be directly proportional to the angle of incidence (the higher the angle of incidence, the higher the erosion yield). On the other hand, above the second threshold that was found to coincide with the threshold of physical sputtering (when both types of chemical and physical sputtering are active), the angle of incidence dependence of the chemical sputtering process was found to behave similar to the physical sputtering process peaks at intermediate angles (60°–70°) but declines at higher energies. Suggesting an enhancing and dominating effect by the mechanical aspect of radiation damage on the amount and behavior of chemical sputtering. These findings underscore the importance of incident angle in determining graphite erosion rates and provide valuable insights for optimizing plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors. The results highlight the need for further experimental validation and exploration of mixed-material designs to mitigate erosion under varying ion bombardment conditions.
