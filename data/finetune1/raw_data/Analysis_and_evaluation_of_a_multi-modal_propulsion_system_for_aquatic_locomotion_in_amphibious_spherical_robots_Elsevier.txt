Abstract
Amphibious robots often face challenges such as redundancy in propulsion system design and harsh operational conditions due to terrain heterogeneity in complex aquatic-terrestrial transition environments. To address these limitations, this study develops an amphibious spherical robot with a multi-modal propulsion system (designated MPS-ASR), featuring the synergistic integra-tion of a pendulum propulsion system and a propeller system. Compared to other multi-modal robots, this work innovates by achieving efficient synergy and low energy consumption through the integration of pendulum and propeller propulsion systems, while maintaining superior performance. The MPS-ASR can operate in three modes: pendulum propulsion, propeller propulsion, and hybrid propulsion. All three modes are suitable for aquatic environments, while terrestrial locomotion prioritizes pendulum propulsion. The hybrid mode is specifically optimized for aquatic-terrestrial transition zones, effectively mitigating the risk of stranding and simplifying the mode-switching process.
To analyze and evaluate the performance of the MPS-ASR in aquatic locomotion, Com-putational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to quantify thrust output and open-water hydrodynamic efficiency of the propeller system at varying rotational speeds. A Lagrangian-based dynamic model was formulated for the pendulum propulsion system, and both MATLAB/Simulink simulations and physical tests were conducted to analyze its nonlinear kinematic characteristics. The discrepancies between the two methods were found to be less than 5 %, validating the accuracy of the developed model. Comparative CFD studies further investigated hydrodynamic performance differences between propeller-only and multi-modal propulsion configurations. Experimental validation under open-water conditions confirmed the accuracy of the simulation results, revealing that hybrid propulsion can maintain 95 %–97 % of the speed achieved by pure propeller propulsion, while also overcoming issues such as stranding. Both numerical simulations and physical experiments corroborated the efficacy of the multi-modal propulsion system, while revealing synergistic interactions between propulsion modes. These findings establish a theoretical framework for optimizing control strategies and deployment protocols for multi-modal propulsion systems in complex amphibious environments.

1. Introduction
Amphibious robots have garnered significant research attention due to their operational versatility in aquatic, terrestrial, and transitional environments. However, their deployment in complex hydro-terrestrial ecosystems – characterized by inherent uncertainties and heterogeneous challenges such as sudden water level fluctuations causing stranding, stochastic underwater obstacles, and sediment-induced interference – necessitates robust engineering solutions. To ensure reliable performance across dynamic amphibious conditions, propulsion system optimization emerges as a critical determinant, requiring meticulous design considerations beyond basic locomotion capabilities in homogeneous environments. Current propulsion architectures predominantly adopt two design philosophies: 1) multifunctional unitary propulsion systems (Crespi et al., 2013; Dey et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2016; Faudzi et al., 2017), and 2) specialized multi-system configurations (Yu et al., 2012; Han et al., 2011; Marquardt et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2018; Xing et al., 2019; Cohen and Zarrouk, 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023). The latter approach implements distinct propulsion mechanisms for aquatic versus terrestrial domains, employing modality switching to achieve environmental adaptability. Representative implementations include Yan et al. (Yan et al.), who developed a dual-propulsion hybrid system integrating track-based terrestrial locomotion with propeller-driven aquatic mobility. Li et al. (2018) engineered a tri-modal actuation system combining flywheels, oscillating pendulums, and propellers, enabling pendulum-driven terrestrial propulsion complemented by aquatic propeller thrust. Xia et al. (2024) proposed a bio-inspired solution featuring synchronized track propulsion and pectoral fin mechanisms for enhanced substrate adaptability. While multi-modal propulsion systems rely on separate mechanisms for different environments, other researchers have explored single, composite propulsion systems to achieve adaptive motion in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. These systems rely on structural transformations of the propulsion mechanism to meet the demands of diverse conditions. For instance, Ma et al. (2022) introduced a novel robot named SHOALBOT, which features a composite propulsion mechanism called the “propeller-leg." By altering its structural configuration, this mechanism operates as a propeller in aquatic environments and transforms into a wheel structure for terrestrial locomotion. Experiments demonstrated that SHOALBOT achieves a maximum speed of 1.8 m/s on land and 1 m/s in water. Similarly, Long et al. (Bai et al., 2021) developed a composite propulsion mechanism that adopts a curved-leg configuration on land and a webbed-fin structure in water. However, this system exhibited relatively low speeds, reaching only 0.29 m/s on land and 0.17 m/s underwater. Ge et al. (2024) proposed a deformable wheel-spoke-paddle propulsion mechanism that adapts to various terrains by using a crank-slider structure for transformation between configurations. Li et al. designed an amphibious spherical robot(ASR) equipped with four actuating units for locomotion. Each actuating unit comprises a water-jet propulsion system and two servo motors. During aquatic motion, the water-jet provides thrust by expelling water, while in terrestrial environments, the water-jet transforms into a legged configuration to enable effective movement. Amphibious robots with single composite propulsion systems often rely on structural transformations to achieve amphibious locomotion. While these systems feature a single propulsion mechanism, the structural complexity and control challenges associated with such transformations pose significant limitations. Moreover, environmental debris such as sand and mud can easily clog the transformation mechanisms, leading to operational failures in practical applications. On the other hand, robots equipped with multiple propulsion systems can achieve land and water mobility by selectively engaging appropriate mechanisms (see Table 9).
However, few studies have investigated the cooperative use of multiple propulsion systems for simultaneous or hybrid operation, particularly on water surfaces. From a theoretical perspective, several critical gaps remain unaddressed. First, the hydrodynamic interactions and cooperative control strategies between distinct propulsion mech-anisms in hybrid modes have not been systematically studied. Second, existing research on multi-modal amphibious robots—especially those with spherical architectures—has largely focused on discrete mode operation rather than integrated hybrid propulsion, leaving questions regarding aquatic stability, energy efficiency, and maneuverability under combined modes unresolved. Finally, while some studies have conducted laboratory evaluations (Li et al., 2015a, 2022), comprehensive validation under real-world, dynamic amphibious conditions is scarce, limiting the practical reliability of proposed designs. To address the identified research gaps, this study proposes an amphibious spherical robot equipped with a multi-modal propulsion system (MPS-ASR), consisting of a propeller propulsion system and a pendulum propulsion system, both capable of independent propulsion on water surfaces. The primary scientific objective of this paper is to investigate the hybrid dynamics and fluid-structure interactions between these two propulsion systems, both individually and in combination. By conducting systematic simulation analyses and field experiments, this study aims to understand the hydrodynamic changes in surface locomotion under different propulsion modes, optimize propulsion parameters, and ultimately improve the efficiency and maneuverability of the robot. The results provide deeper insights into the interactions between the two systems and contribute to the broader understanding of hybrid propulsion in amphibious robots.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II elaborates on the structural design and parameters of the multi-modal propulsion systems. Section III employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools (STAR-CCM+) to simulate thrust characteristics and analyze open-water performance of propeller propulsion. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the propeller propulsion mode and hybrid propulsion mode under multi-modal configurations, with comparative analysis of their respective performances. Additionally, a dynamic model of the pendulum propulsion system is established using the Lagrangian method, followed by model verification and analysis through MATLAB simulations. Finally, we further compare the motion performance and locomotion characteristics of the proposed MPS-ASR with those of typical propeller-only systems. Section IV presents field experiments assessing the real-world aquatic performance of the multi-modal propulsion system in both propeller propulsion mode and hybrid propulsion mode, accompanied by quantitative comparisons between these operational modalities. Section V concludes this study with a comprehensive summary of findings and contributions. Finally, for the convenience of readers, a Nomenclature table listing all symbols, ratios, and abbreviations is provided at the end of this section.

The amphibious spherical robot studied in this work exhibits notable differences compared to the widely researched amphibious spherical robot developed by Professor Guo Shuxiang's team (Shi et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2012). Firstly, it features a larger size and includes mounting platforms that allow the installation of various devices as needed, enhancing its practical applicability. This design has been widely applied in real-world industrial scenarios such as airport patrols and security tasks.
Additionally, the robot's pendulum propulsion system supports dual-use functionality for both land and water environments without requiring a mode-switching mechanism. However, its propulsion speed in water is relatively low, primarily due to limited frictional forces in the aquatic environment, akin to a car driving on a low-friction surface. On land, however, the system demonstrates clear performance improvements, offering critical advantages in addressing challenges like stranding. Despite its capability to operate in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, the limited speed of the pendulum propulsion system in water poses a key constraint for broader applications. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multi-modal propulsion system combining a pendulum propulsion mechanism with a propeller system. In this design, the propeller system serves as the primary power source for water surface locomotion. This section presents the design and parameters of the multi-modal propulsion system. Fig. 2 illustrates the movement of the proposed amphibious spherical robot in a real-world environment.

2.1. Propeller propulsion system
In the design of the propeller propulsion system, the primary consideration was the water surface performance of the spherical robot. To enable the proposed Amphibious Spherical Robot (ASR) to achieve agile movement on water with zero turning radius, two propellers were installed to implement the differential drive principle.
The next consideration was the installation position of the propeller system. Traditionally, for ships or unmanned vessels, propellers are typically mounted at the underside and stern of the hull, which helps optimize propulsion efficiency and reduce water flow interference (Tupper, 2013). However, for the amphibious spherical robot (ASR) in this study, which needs to operate in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, the traditional stern mounting configuration is not suitable. Specifically, the stern position is constrained by the requirements of amphibious motion. As a result, the propeller is mounted on a dedicated mounting platform. This design takes into account the adaptability of the propulsion system during the transition between land and water environments, ensuring its stability and performance in both conditions. Additionally, the mounting platform is designed for easy detachment, so if the robot is only required to operate on land, the land-mode platform can be used instead. This mounting configuration not only overcomes the limitations of traditional stern installations but also ensures sufficient thrust for the robot on both land and water. To optimize the performance of the propeller and ensure its draft, the installation position was adjusted to be as low as possible without affecting terrestrial mobility. After comprehensive consideration, the propeller was mounted 24.25 cm above the ground, with an adjustable tilt angle of 37.53°, as shown in Fig. 3.

2.2. Pendulum propulsion system
The pendulum propulsion system designed in this study is a single-pendulum system, consisting primarily of motors, pendulum and arms. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the lateral and longitudinal oscillations ofthe pendulum alter the robot's center of mass, generating an eccentric torque. This torque is transmitted to the spherical shell through the arm and frame, resulting in the rotation and tilting of the shell, thereby enabling straight-line motion and turning operations. Table 3 presents the main parameters of the pendulum propulsion system. The specific parameters have been detailed in our previous work and will not be reiterated here. Fig. 5 illustrates the motion concept of the pendulum propulsion system during operation.

3. Performance analysis of multi-modal propulsion system
To evaluate the performance of the MPS-ASR in aquatic locomotion, a numerical performance analysis of the propulsion system was first conducted. To better assess the performance of the multi-modal propulsion system in hybrid propulsion mode, individual modeling and performance analysis were carried out for each propulsion system.
3.1. CFD analysis of propeller performance
3.1.1. Computational domain setup
To analyze the performance of the propeller propulsion system, we first conducted a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis of the propeller's hydrostatic performance. This verification lays the foundation for subsequent CFD analysis of the multi-modal hybrid propulsion system. The simulation software used is STAR-CCM+. Based on literature review (Ahmed et al., 2020; Köksal et al., 2021), two computational domain were designed: a static region and a rotating region. The static region is used to calculate the external flow field, while the rotating region simulates the fluid variations near the propeller blades during rotation. The static region is configured as a cylindrical domain with a radius of 5D and a length of 13D, where the propeller is located 3D from the inlet and 10D from the outlet. The rotating region is also cylindrical, with a diameter of 121 mm and a length of 53 mm. In the stationary computational region, the inlet is defined as a velocity inlet, the outlet as a pressure outlet, and the remaining surfaces are treated as wall boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

3.1.2. Mesh generation
Mesh generation is a crucial step in CFD analysis. To balance computational cost and result accuracy, this study adopts a refined mesh strategy. Considering the propeller rotation and the complex flow within the rotating domain, as well as the intricate flow inside and outside the duct and the divergent wake downstream, local mesh refinement is applied. A cylindrical region (radius 0.1 m, length 0.15 m) covering the entire rotating domain and duct, and a conical region (length 1 m, starting radius 0.1 m, ending radius 0.3 m) encompassing the wake, are defined for this purpose. The static domain is meshed using a surface-reconstructing cut-cell method, while the cone and cylinder regions use 5 layers of prismatic mesh with a thickness of 2 mm. The mesh size is set to 1 % of the base size in the cone region and 2 % in the cylinder region. The generated mesh is shown in Fig. 7.

The rotating region is a cylinder that fully encloses the propeller diameter and extends along the length of the blades and shaft. As this region involves the most complex fluid flow, surface reconstruction and cut-cell meshing are applied, with a basic mesh size of 2 mm. To accurately capture the boundary layer flow around the blades and shaft, 8 layers of prismatic mesh with a total thickness of 1 mm are used. The mesh distribution of the rotating region and propeller blades is shown in Fig. 8. The final mesh count for the entire model is 3.76 million.

3.1.3. Thrust simulation
After the mesh generation, the thrust was calculated and compared with experimental thrust data. Considering the measured thrust in calm water, calculations were performed starting from 1200 RPM to the propeller's rated speed of 3000 RPM, with a 300 RPM interval, using the same computational conditions. A total of seven data sets were collected, as shown in Fig. 9 and Table 10(in Appendix).

Fig. 9. Compare thrust of experimental and simulated.

Firstly, it can be observed that the trends of the two thrust curves are generally consistent, indicating that the simulation case accurately captures the key characteristics of the actual propeller. Secondly, while there is a significant discrepancy in thrust values, especially at lower speeds, this is mainly due to thrust losses. These losses include mechanical losses in the testing apparatus, turbulence effects, boundary effects, and the losses caused by water flow encountering the pool walls and bottom. Further error analysis is provided in the Appendix. From the error analysis, it is evident that as the speed increases, the error decreases, and by 3000 RPM, the difference between the two thrust values narrowed to 27.4 %.
3.1.4. Propeller Open-water performance simulation
To gain a deeper understanding of the propeller propulsion system, a simulation analysis of the propeller's open-water performance was conducted. The propeller speed was set to 2100 RPM, and the advance ratio J was varied by changing the inlet velocity of the water. The open-water performance results are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 11(in Appendix). From the analysis, it can be observed that the propeller in this study achieves the highest efficiency at an advance ratio between 0.6 and 0.7. Prior to this range, increasing the advance ratio leads to higher efficiency. This suggests that, before J reaches 0.6–0.7, increasing the advance ratio is an effective method to improve the efficiency of the propeller propulsion system and reduce energy consumption.

3.2. Modeling and analysis of pendulum propulsion systems
When the MPS-ASR moves forward using the pendulum propulsion system, the lateral pendulum effects (side-to-side swinging) can be neglected, and only the longitudinal pendulum effects (forward-backward swinging) are considered. The MPS-ASR exhibits complex dynamics on the water surface. Unlike the Newton-Euler method, which is based on forces and moments, the Lagrangian method derives the equations of motion using the system's kinetic and potential energies. This approach is particularly convenient for systems having constraints and multiple degrees of freedom. Therefore, this paper employs the Lagrangian method for the dynamic modeling.
3.2.1. System description and reference frames
The amphibious spherical robot (MPS-ASR) is modeled as consisting of three main rigid bodies, as illustrated in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11. Schematic diagram of the main modeling modules.

As illustrated in Fig. 12, the amphibious spherical robot rolling on the water surface from point A to point B along the positive X-direction. As the robot moves forward, the frame is rigidly connected to the pendulum, swinging together as it moves. The following reference frames are established for the modeling process.
•
An inertial world-fixed coordinate system FW = {X; Y }, where the origin is located on the water along the X-axis, horizontally far from the spherical robot, corresponding to the tangential extension of the lowest point of the submerged spherical shell. This ensures that the lowest point of the submerged portion of the spherical shell is used as the gravitational potential energy reference, i.e., this point is set to have zero gravitational potential energy. The X-axis extends horizontally along the calm water surface, and the Y-axis points vertically upward. This coordinate setup facilitates a clear description of both the translational motion of the spherical shell and the pendulum swing, as well as the energy analysis of the system.
•
A local spherical shell-fixed coordinate system centered at the center of the spherical shell.
•
The position of the spherical shell center is denoted as (xs; ys) in FW.

The generalized coordinates are defined as.
•
α: The rolling angle of the spherical shell relative to the world frame.
•
θ: The swing angle of the pendulum relative to the spherical shell's vertical axis.
When the MPS-ASR moves forward using the pendulum propulsion system, the lateral pendulum effects (side-to-side swinging) can be neglected, and only the longitudinal pendulum effects (forward-backward swinging) are considered. To better analyze the dynamic model of the spherical robot in water surface motion, the following assumptions are made.
•
An effective rolling constraint with minimal slip between the spherical shell and the water surface is assumed (justified in Appendix I).
•
The mass center of the frame coincides with the spherical shell center, contributing only to rotational dynamics.
•
The gravitational potential energy change of the shell and frame is negligible during rolling.
3.2.2. Position and velocity expressions
A.
Spherical Shell Center Position
In this study, the MPS-ASR rolls along the positive X-direction on the water surface under the pure rolling constraint. The center of the spherical shell maintains a constant vertical position, and its translational velocities in the world frame are given by:
(1)
B.
Pendulum Mass Center Position
The mass center of the pendulum is rigidly connected to the internal frame, which shares the same center as the spherical shell. The pendulum swings within the spherical shell, and its relative position with respect to the shell center, considering the two-dimensional rolling motion on the water surface, is given by:
(2)
The absolute position of the pendulum mass center in the world-fixed coordinate system is thus:
(3)xp = xs + L sin(θ); yp = ys − L cos(θ)
By differentiating it with respect to time, the velocity is obtained as:

where Ts 1 is the translational kinetic energy of the spherical shell.
Frame:
Since the center of mass of the frame coincides with that of the spherical shell, the frame does not exhibit translational motion relative to the spherical shell, i.e., the translational kinetic energy of the frame(Tf1) is 0. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the frame is entirely derived from its rotation about the central axis.

3.2.6. Eccentric torque and hydrodynamic forces
Eccentric Torque M1:
Due to pendulum-induced center of mass offset:
(18)
Hydrodynamic Torque 
:
When the MPS-ASR rolls forward on the water surface, the primary hydrodynamic forces acting on it include buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag. However, since the gravitational force and buoyancy are balanced during the robot's surface locomotion, the potential energy of the frame and spherical shell can be considered negligible. In contrast, the potential energy of the pendulum is independent of buoyancy and, thus, has a negligible effect on the rolling motion of the robot and can be disregarded. During the rolling motion of the amphibious spherical robot on the water surface, the hydrodynamic drag is mainly composed of three components: viscous drag acting on the submerged portion, air drag acting on the emerged portion, and residual drag. According to the literature (Birk, 2019), the formulas for calculating viscous drag and air drag are given as follows:
(19)
(20)
where Ff represents the viscous drag acting on the submerged portion, and Fp denotes the air drag acting on the emerged portion of the robot. In these expressions, represents the fluid density, Af is the submerged cross-sectional area, and Ap is the frontal area above the water. According to the literature (Kundu et al., 2024), both Cf and Cp can be taken as 0.47. The specific parameters are listed in Table 4.

The largest component of the residual resistance is the wave-making resistance, which is relatively complex. In this study, a constant value Fwaveis used to represent it. Through MATLAB simulations, we designed five sets of data with different throttle inputs for analysis. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 13 and Table 5.

The maximum error occurs at a 40 % throttle, where the error reaches −4.8 %. The minimum error occurs at a 50 % throttle, with an error of −1.3 %. All errors are within 5 %, indicating that the model developed in this study is accurate and provides a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent research.

Thrust Performance Evaluation of Propeller Propulsion System
The thrust generated by the propulsion system is a key performance indicator for the surface motion of the robot. Although the propeller thrust was previously measured in a still water tank, the thrust generated when thepropeller is integrated into the robot differs from that of the standalone propeller, better representing the actual thrustin practical applications. This, in turn, directly demonstrates the performance of the propeller propulsionsystem and determines the robot's mobility. Thus, determining the actual thrust after assembly on therobot is of conslderable importance.
To quantify this parameter and compare it with the simulated thrust, we designed a moored tension testing experiment to measure the thrust of propeller propulsion system in open water on the actual robot. Fig. 14(a) shows both the thrust testing schematic and the actual testing scenario. From the schematic, it is clear that the entire setup involves presetting parameters on a computer, which are then sent to the respective propulsion systems. The thrust is recorded using a force gauge, the thrust data is processed to obtain the most accurate and realistic thrust measurements.
For the thrust testing of the propeller propulsion system in field applications of the MPS-ASR, a rotational speed range from 1080 RPM to 2880 RPM with 300 RPM intervals was established. This test range was determined based on the following considerations.
(i)
the propulsion system generates relatively small thrust values at low rotational speeds.

the field testing environment presents complex environmental interference factors.
As shown in Table 6, the experimental data revealed that the thrust generated by the propeller propulsion system was 19 N at 1080 RPM, while the maximum thrust reached 321 N. It should be noted that these values represent the total thrust of the system, accounting for the combined contribution of two propeller thrusters. This result highlights a noticeable discrepancy between the actual thrust performance of the amphibious robot and the theoretical expectations, thereby supporting our initial hypothesis. The thrust enhancement was defined as the difference between the current thrust value and the thrust value at the previous rotational speed. Analysis indicated that below 1980 RPM, the thrust increased by approximately 100 % for every 300 RPM increase in rotational speed. Beyond this point, the thrust increment gradually decreased. This trend aligns with theoretical predictions, where the thrust enhancement tends to stabilize as the rotational speed approaches the rated value. As shown in Fig. 14(b), red data points denote thrust measurements in the low-speed range, while blue data points represent measurements in the high-speed range.

To further analyze the experimental data, a piecewise regression method was employed to fit the thrust characteristics. Based on the thrust distribution pattern, the data were divided into two segments for curve fitting: low-speed and high-speed ranges. The fitting curves were constructed using MATLAB, and the corresponding fitting equations were derived. The thrust fitting equation for the low-speed range is:
(26)y = 0.00013x2 − 0.25967x + 144.07657 (R2 = 0.999)
For the high-speed range, the thrust fitting equation is:
(27)y = −0.00015x2 + 0.89517x + 1037.61 (R2 = 0.9964)
The coefficient of determination (R2) indicates that both fitting curves exhibit high precision with minimal residuals, demonstrating excellent fitting performance. This provides a reliable data foundation for subsequent research requiring detailed thrust analysis.

Simulation Setup and Process
A. Pre-Simulation Processing: To evaluate the performance of the propeller system within the multi-modal propulsion system, CFD simulations were conducted to analyze resistance and velocity under operating conditions. A detailed 3D model of the MPS-ASR was first built in SolidWorks to obtain essential parameters such as mass, center of gravity, and dimensions. For fluid simulations in Star-CCM+, the model was simplified by removing internal structures and optimizing external features irrelevant to hydrodynamics, such as propeller holes. The simplified model was exported in Parasolid (.x_t) format and imported into Star-CCM+, where geometric corrections, including surface repairs and edge merging, were performed to ensure model integrity. The computational domain was carefully designed to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Based on experience and literature, the domain extended three times the robot length upstream, five times downstream, twice the robot length above, 2.5 times below, and 2.5 times to each side (measured from the robot's center). A Boolean subtraction was applied to generate the final fluid domain, as shown in Fig. 15.
It is worth noting that while the open-water performance of the propeller was previously analyzed, the virtual disk method (Rubin and Zhao, 2021; Li et al., 2015b) was adopted in this study to simplify the simulation without compromising accuracy. The propeller's thrust and torque, derived from open-water tests, were applied directly to the model, without explicitly modeling the propeller. The simulation aims to predict the resistance and velocity of the MPS-ASR during water-surface motion, involving a multiphase flow of air and water. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method in Star-CCM+ was employed to capture the air–water interface. Given the complex hydrodynamic interactions and the unique spherical geometry of the MPS-ASR, mesh refinement was applied around the water surface and the robot to improve accuracy. The final mesh configuration, shown in Fig. 16, consists of approximately 3.28 × 10^6 cells.
B. Simulation Results and Analysis: In the simulations of resistance and speed, numerical analysis was initiated at 1200 RPM (40 % throttle) to maintain consistency with the practical thrust measurement protocol. Given the experimental impracticality of direct resistance quantification under operational conditions, the hydrodynamic resistance was theoretically equated to thrust through Newton's second law application. Consequently, open-water thrust measurements were systematically adopted as surrogate resistance values during dynamic simulations. As shown in Fig. 17, in the low-speed range (1200–1800 RPM), there was a significant discrepancy between the simulation and actual measurements for both resistance and speed. At 1200 RPM, the maximum resistance error reached 139 %, and the maximum speed error was 31 %. The large resistance error was likely caused by wave effects at the stern, which led to the motion of the towing line being influenced by the waves, causing significant measurement errors. The 31 % speed error may have been due to neglected environmental factors in the simulation, such as variations in water currents and wind flow, as well as the need for finer mesh resolution. In the high-speed range (2100–3000 RPM), the maximum resistance prediction error was only 12 %, and the maximum speed error was 8 %. Moreover, the minimum resistance error was 2 %, and the minimum speed error was 1 %. These results are very promising for the prediction of performance in amphibious robots moving on the water surface, a complex scenario.
Fig. 18a, Fig. 18b illustrates the wave patterns during motion. It can be observed that when the MPS-ASR moves on the water surface using solely the propeller propulsion system, noticeable waves are generated at both the bow (fore) and stern (aft) regions. Specifically, the bow-shaped wave generated at the front of the MPS-ASR is significantly higher in both range and amplitude compared to those produced by conventional unmanned surface vessels. This phenomenon is closely related to the unique shape of the MPS-ASR and is one of the main reasons for the higher resistance encountered during its water surface motion. Additionally, there is a noticeable decrease in the draft on both sides of the MPS-ASR. We hypothesize that this is due to the spherical shape of the MPS-ASR, which causes a larger and more expansive bow wave. This larger wave range results in a delayed replenishment of water to the sides of the robot, leading to a decrease in water level on both lateral sides. As the speed increases, the differences in water levels at the fore, aft, and lateral positions become more pronounced. The height of the bow wave also increases, from 37.3 mm at 1200 RPM to 114 mm at 3000 RPM, and the intensity of the resulting waves expands. The water level deficit increases from −73 mm at 1200 RPM to −263 mm at 3000 RPM, with the maximum water level deficit shifting from the front lateral side to the rear lateral side of the MPS-ASR. These complex fluid dynamics induced by the motion hinder the speed enhancement of the MPS-ASR. The simulations reveal the intricate changes in fluid behavior during motion.
3.3.2. Prediction and analysis of motion resistance and speed in multi-modal hybrid propulsion mode
(1)
Pre-Simulation Processing
The hybrid propulsion simulation was conducted by extending the propeller propulsion system model. To implement the rotational motion of the spherical shell, a relative velocity boundary condition was applied to the shell surface. The rotational speed of the spherical shell was set to 5 rps, consistent with the actual motion of the MPS-ASR in water driven by the pendulum propulsion system.
(2)
Simulation Results and Analysis
In the hybrid propulsion mode simulation, similar to the propeller propulsion mode, we analyzed motion velocity, resistance, and wave dynamics. Fig. 19a, Fig. 19b depicts the motion under hybrid propulsion. As propeller speed increases, surface wave patterns grow more complex. Unlike pure propeller propulsion, water splash is driven by the rotating spherical shell, and the model sinks deeper at its lowest position. This sinking trend, which does not occur in pure propeller mode, implies that the presence of the pendulum system results in a deeper draft for the MPS-ASR. This effect likely stems from enhanced surface turbulence caused by the rotating shell, leading to larger waves and deeper submersion. Furthermore, the bow wave height increases with propeller speed, aligning with trends observed in pure propeller propulsion.
Fig. 20 presents the predictions of resistance, speed, and virtual disk thrust under the hybrid propulsion mode, compared with the propeller propulsion mode. Firstly, the resistance of the MPS-ASR during surface motion shows the most significant difference between the two modes, with the hybrid propulsion mode consistently exhibiting lower resistance than the propeller propulsion mode. The maximum difference reaches −20.9 %, while the minimum difference is −5.5 %. This phenomenon is primarily caused by the rotation of the spherical shell driven by the pendulum propulsion system, which disturbs the surrounding water flow, suppresses wave wall formation, and reduces pressure drag, thereby decreasing the overall hydrodynamic resistance. A detailed analysis is presented in the Appendix for further clarification. Additionally, the virtual disk thrust in the hybrid propulsion mode follows a similar trend, being lower than that in the propeller propulsion mode, with a maximum difference of-4.8 %. Notably, the differences in thrust are all within 5 %, indicating that the two modes are relatively close in terms of thrust performance. Regarding the speed comparison, the differences are also minor, within 5 %. However, the hybrid propulsion mode does not always result in higher speeds: at 1200 RPM and 1800 RPM, the speed under the hybrid propulsion mode is lower, while at other speeds, the propeller propulsion mode yields lower speeds. In summary, the performance of the hybrid and propeller propulsion mode in driving the MPS-ASR on the water surface is quite similar. Moreover, the pendulum propulsion system operates without hindering the propeller propulsion system and improves the MPS-ASR's ability to cope with sudden challenges such as grounding, thereby enhancing the robot's adaptability to complex environments. Additionally, a detailed discussion on mesh independence and time step independence has been provided in the Appendix. The results demonstrate that the mesh and temporal settings used in this study are well-validated, thereby ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the simulation results.
3.4. Comparison with propeller-only baseline systems
To gain a deeper understanding of the performance of the proposed MPS-ASR system, this section presents a comparison with two typical propeller-only systems (Crespi et al., 2013): the WAM-V 16 USV(Unmanned Surface Vehicle), a real-world deployed surface vehicle (experimental benchmark); and (Dey et al., 2013) the STAR-CCM + Marine Self-Propulsion Case (MSC), representing a simulated baseline system (simulation-based comparison).
3.4.1. Experimental performance comparison
Table 7summarizes the detailed performance metrics of the three systems. In terms of weight and length along the direction of surge motion, the MPS-ASR is categorized as a small-sized surface vehicle, while the WAM-V 16 is medium-sized, with more than double the weight and over five times the length of MPS-ASR (see Table 8).

In terms of maximum velocity, the ranking is WAM-V 16 > MPS-ASR, while the drag at max velocity follows WAM-V 16 > MPS-ASR. Regarding endurance at full velocity, WAM-V 16 performs better; however, at half velocity, MPS-ASR shows significantly longer endurance, indicating different performance advantages under different operational conditions.
To further normalize the comparison, all metrics were adjusted with respect to vehicle weight and velocity, yielding several normalized indicators: First, the Max. Velocity/Weight indicator reflects the maximum velocity achievable per kilogram of vehicle mass, effectively indicating the propulsion capability on the water surface. Among the systems, the WAM-V 16 exhibits the highest value, while the MPS-ASR follows at approximately half of the WAM-V's performance. Next, the Drag/Weight indicator represents the drag experienced per unit of mass during navigation, illustrating the hydrodynamic resistance encountered on the water surface. The data shows that, at their respective maximum speeds, the WAM-V 16 experiences 46.6 % more drag per unit weight than the MPS-ASR.
Considering that drag is closely related to velocity in surface navigation, we further normalized this metric by velocity as well, yielding the indicator Drag/(Weight·Velocity). The result shows that the MPS-ASR's value is 2.26 times greater than that of the WAM-V 16, indicating that under equal mass and speed, the MPS-ASR experiences significantly greater resistance. This aligns with expectations, as the spherical shape of the MPS-ASR results in a larger underwater cross-sectional area, causing more drag compared to conventionally shaped vessels of similar size. The Energy/Velocity indicator reflects the energy required to achieve a unit velocity. The MPS-ASR consumes approximately 20 % more energy than the WAM-V 16 for the same speed. Finally, the Energy/(Velocity·Time·Weight) indicator represents the energy required to transport one unit of mass over one unit of distance. The WAM-V 16 demonstrates much better performance here, with values nearly half that of the MPS-ASR, highlighting its superior energy efficiency in payload transportation. Together, these two energy-related indicators clearly show that, in terms of transport energy efficiency, the WAM-V 16 is more economical. However, the MPS-ASR offers other performance advantages suited to specific amphibious use cases.
3.4.2. Water surface propulsion characteristics comparison
From the pressure distribution in Fig. 21(a), it is evident that there are significant differences in the hydrodynamic characteristics between the MPS-ASR and a conventional vessel (represented by the MSC model) during surface propulsion. On the left, the MSC exhibits a classic triangular pressure distribution pattern centered along the hull. A high-pressure zone forms at the bow due to wave-making resistance, low-pressure zones appear along the midship sides, and a pronounced high-pressure wake is generated at the stern by the propeller's thrust and flow separation. This continuous and symmetrical pressure field is characteristic of streamlined hulls in traditional marine propulsion. In contrast, the MPS-ASR (right image) does not exhibit a typical triangular high-pressure region. Instead, two local high-pressure zones appear on either side and near the rear of the spherical shell, mainly due to the placement of propellers on both sides. This leads to a more discontinuous and asymmetric pressure distribution, highlighting the differences in propulsion mechanism, structural symmetry, and flow disturbance. The localized and asymmetric nature of MPS-ASR's pressure field is a direct result of its unique propulsion configuration.
In the velocity field comparison (Fig. 21(b)), the MSC demonstrates higher propulsion efficiency, with a well-defined, high-velocity jet forming along the stern. The wake is concentrated and directional, indicating focused energy output and superior hydrodynamic performance. In contrast, the MPS-ASR generates high-velocity zones on both lateral sides, while the rear displays a wide and asymmetric high-velocity wake. The velocity field is more dispersed, reflecting the distributed thrust due to the lateral propeller configuration and flow interference caused by the spherical structure. This suggests that although the MPS-ASR can generate localized high-speed regions, its overall propulsion efficiency is lower than that of the streamlined MSC, reaffirming the advantages of a conventional hull design in terms of flow performance.
The vorticity field provides a direct representation of how the vehicle interacts with the water surface. The intensity and spatial distribution of vorticity are influenced by the location of the propulsion unit and reveal mechanisms of shear, separation, and vortex generation—critical factors for understanding flow control and dynamic stability. As shown in Fig. 21(c), the MSC forms a typical wake vortex structure aligned along the central axis behind the stern. This structure is highly symmetrical and well-organized. The vorticity field can be categorized into three regions.
(a)
The midship area shows “wing-like” symmetrical shear layers radiating from the hull due to flow separation.
(b)
The left and right stern regions exhibit strong vorticity zones induced by the propeller.
(c)
A focused vortex bundle forms along the axial centerline, indicating a coherent and stable wake flow.
In comparison, the MPS-ASR's vorticity is more broadly distributed around both the front and rear of the spherical shell, forming a mushroom-like pattern. This complex vorticity structure results from the side-mounted propellers and the unique geometry of the MPS-ASR system. As a result, the wake generated by the MPS-ASR is more spatially extensive and dynamically complex, leading to stronger hydrodynamic fluctuations and increased wake disturbances during operation.
In summary, the surface propulsion characteristics of MPS-ASR and MSC differ significantly. The MSC demon-strates superior propulsion efficiency and a stable, symmetric wake structure. In contrast, the MPS-ASR, while offering structural flexibility and an innovative propulsion concept, exhibits more complex and localized flow characteristics. These observations highlight the trade-offs between conventional and novel propulsion architectures in amphibious robot design.
4. Performance evaluation of multi-modal propulsion system in field conditions
Previous sections presented the simulation and modeling analysis of the multi-modal motion of the MPS-ASR, which validated the correctness of the pendulum propulsion model and demonstrated minor differences between the hybrid propulsion mode and the propeller propulsion mode. To further verify the motion performance of the MPS-ASR and consolidate the simulation conclusions, this chapter conducts field performance tests on the ASR equipped with the multi-modal propulsion system, along with energy consumption performance tests. To validate the actual motion and energy consumption performance of the multi-modal propulsion system on the ASR, we conducted an open water evaluation of the system's speed and energy efficiency on the water surface. The field tests were performed at the Xiasha Jiangbin Inland River in Xiasha District, Hangzhou, China. The specific geographical location is illustrated in Fig. 22.
During field testing, the influence of environmental factors on the robot's motion speed must be considered, especially in the pendulum propulsion mode, where the robot's speed is relatively low. Environmental disturbances may introduce uncertainties in the assessment of the propulsion system's performance. To minimize the impact of environmental factors on speed measurements, we will select periods with sufficiently low environmental disturbances to conduct the performance testing experiments. First, we conducted tests on the environmentally induced MPS-ASR speed variations in the testing area. The results are presented in Fig. 23. As can be observed from the graph, the maximum velocity reaches 0.037 m/s, and over time, the velocity eventually stabilizes below 0.015 m/s.Such minimal velocities render environmental impacts on the test results entirely negligible, and the tests will be conducted at sufficiently low environmental velocities.
4.1. Pendulum propulsion mode performance
The pendulum propulsion system generates thrust through the rolling motion of the MPS-ASR's spherical hull on the water surface. Due to the low friction between the spherical shell and water, its propulsion efficiency is limited, resulting in significantly lower speeds compared to conventional propeller systems. Therefore, performance tests were conducted at 20 %–60 % throttle, focusing on its role as an auxiliary propulsion system (Table 8). The results show a linear speed increase from 0.149 m/s to 0.239 m/s across the tested throttle range. Except for a smaller 6.86 % gain from 40 % to 50 % throttle, other 10 % throttle increments yield consistent 14 % speed improvements. However, energy consumption rises nonlinearly, increasing from 73.928 Wh to 220.649 Wh. Particularly, energy surges of approximately 40 % are observed at 30 % and 50 % throttle, while 20 % increases occur at 40 % and 60 % throttle. This velocity-energy mismatch reflects the system's unique hydrodynamics, where stable speed gains coexist with vortex-induced energy dissipation. Despite the low velocity, the pendulum system offers notable endurance advantages, with operation times decreasing from 32.464 h at 20 % throttle to 10.877 h at 60 % throttle, exceeding the endurance of comparable amphibious robots (Crespi et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2012).
4.2. Propeller propulsion mode performance
According to historical test data, the propeller thrust exhibits significant fluctuations below 60 % throttle. To accurately evaluate the propulsion performance, a differential throttle interval experimental design was implemented: 5 % intervals below 60 % throttle and 10 % intervals above 60 %. As shown in Table 9, Velocity Enhancement and Energy Enhancement represent the speed and energy gains relative to the previous throttle level, respectively.
The experimental data reveal that at 10 % throttle, the propulsion speed reaches 0.136 m/s, which is approximately four times the ambient flow velocity. As the throttle increases, the influence of ambient flow velocity becomes negligible. The maximum propulsion speed is achieved at 90 % throttle (1.342 m/s), with only a 0.2 % difference compared to the speed at 100 % throttle. Additionally, the maximum energy consumption (1747.306 Wh) also occurs at 90 % throttle, which is nearly equivalent to the energy consumption at 100 % throttle. These results indicate that the propulsion system has reached its hydrodynamic performance limit in the throttle range above 90 %. Notably, the 60 % throttle condition demonstrates excellent energy efficiency characteristics: propulsion speed of 0.843 m/s, energy consumption of 386.026 Wh, endurance of 6.2 h, and cruising range of 18.865 km. However, when increasing throttle from 60 % to 70 %, a 33.8 % speed gain is accompanied by a 111 % increase in energy consumption. Energy efficiency analysis indicates that 60 % throttle provides better performance than 70 %, making it the preferred option for calm water operations. Further analysis shows that both 70 %–80 % and 80 %–90 % throttle intervals exhibit similar performance characteristics: speed gains remain around 9 %, with energy consumption increases of approximately 45 %. This indicates that a dynamic equilibrium between propeller thrust and fluid resistance has been achieved in this range. Notably, the 90 %–100 % throttle interval shows a 0.2 % speed decrease and a 0.3 % energy consumption reduction, confirming that 90 % throttle represents the optimal thrust-resistance balance point. Therefore, in practical missions, the optimal propulsion throttle setting can be selected based on endurance and range requirements. To evaluate the relative performance of the proposed MPS-ASR robot in aquatic locomotion, a systematic investigation was conducted on mainstream amphibious robots developed over the past decade.Key performance indicators, including propulsion system configurations, velocity parameters in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, as well as endurance time and cruising range, are summarized in Table 12 provided in the Appendix. Data analysis reveals that the designed multi-modal propulsion system demonstrates outstanding velocity performance: the achieved speed values rank among the top tier of comparable amphibious robots in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. These findings robustly demonstrate that the MPS-ASR system exhibits excellent amphibious mobility performance, reaching industry-leading standards. Furthermore, the MPS-ASR also exhibits competitive advantages in endurance time and cruising range, ranking among the top performers in comparable platforms. These results further validate its strong practicality and potential for real-world applications.
4.3. Hybrid propulsion mode performance
The proposed MPS-ASR integrates dual propulsion systems: a conventional propeller and a pendulum-based mechanism. In hybrid mode, both systems operate simultaneously—the propeller provides forward thrust, while the pendulum system induces rolling motion of the spherical shell. This rolling motion functions similarly to a tire traversing uneven terrain, enabling the robot to overcome small surface obstacles commonly encountered in shallow waters and aquatic-terrestrial transition zones. Stranding, a frequent and challenging issue for amphibious robots in such environments, is effectively mitigated by this rolling capability. Additionally, the pendulum system can actively adjust the robot's posture by shifting its internal center of mass, enhancing stability and resistance to external disturbances.
This mechanism is conceptually similar to anti-rolling tanks used in ships to improve dynamic stability. As a result, the hybrid mode not only enhances the MPS-ASR's environmental adaptability but also retains the high-speed advantage and excellent maneuverability of propeller propulsion, achieving a balance between obstacle-crossing capability, stability, and efficient locomotion—a key advancement in amphibious robot design.
Performance comparisons show that propeller propulsion remains optimal for surface navigation, offering superior speed (up to 1.4 m/s) and maneuverability (zero turning radius), consistent with mainstream aquatic robots. Conse-quently, the hybrid system adopts propeller propulsion as the primary drive, with pendulum propulsion as auxiliary support. To evaluate hybrid performance, tests were conducted under identical environmental conditions for direct comparison. The pendulum throttle was fixed at 30 %, while propeller throttle was varied from 10 % to 100 % (5 % increments below 60 %, 10 % increments above 60 %). The results, summarized in Table 13 (Appendix) and illustrated in Fig. 24, Fig. 25, provide a comprehensive performance comparison with propeller-only configurations.
As shown in Fig. 24, the speed and energy consumption curves for the propeller propulsion system and the hybrid propulsion system are presented. From the energy consumption curve, it is evident that the energy consumption of the hybrid propulsion system remains consistently higher than that of the standalone propeller propulsion system. This indicates that the hybrid propulsion system, incorporating a 30 % pendulum propulsion system, does not contribute to energy savings. However, it is important to note that energy efficiency is not the primary objective of our design of a multi-modal propulsion system. From the speed curve, it can be observed that 30 % propeller throttle acts as a turning point. Prior to this, the hybrid propulsion system exhibits higher speed, while beyond this point, the propeller propulsion system surpasses the hybrid system in speed. This suggests that below 30 % propeller throttle, the inclusion of the 30 % pendulum propulsion system enhances speed, whereas above 30 % propeller throttle, the addition of the 30 % pendulum propulsion system slightly reduces the ASR's surface speed. Further analysis of Table 13, along with the speed gain and energy consumption gain charts, reveals that although the speed increases below 30 % propeller throttle with the inclusion of the pendulum propulsion system, the trade-off is a significant increase in energy consumption. Additionally, it is noteworthy that above 30 % propeller throttle, the speed difference between the two systems remains within 5 %, which aligns with the simulation results. This implies that above 30 % throttle, the speed difference between the hybrid propulsion system and the standalone propeller system is minimal. While the addition of the pendulum propulsion system does not enhance speed beyond this point, it does not create a major hindrance either. This provides valuable speed data support for the practical application of hybrid propulsion systems, as it ensures that significant improvements in environmental adaptability can be achieved while maintaining high speed performance.
Analyzing the energy consumption gain chart further, it is evident that under all throttle conditions, the energy consumption of the hybrid propulsion system is higher, especially at throttle values of 35 % and below, where its energy consumption exceeds that of the propeller propulsion system by more than 150 %. Moreover, the maximum speed gain under these throttle conditions for the hybrid system is limited to just 64.77 %. As the propeller throttle increases, the energy consumption gain of the hybrid system gradually decreases. This is understandable because, with an increase in propeller throttle, the energy consumption of the propeller propulsion system becomes the dominant factor. From the analysis of the standalone propulsion system, it is clear that the energy consumption of the pendulum propulsion system at 30 % throttle is 104.755 Wh, while the energy consumption of the propeller propulsion system increases with throttle, reaching a maximum of 1747.506 Wh. Therefore, the proportion of energy consumption from the pendulum propulsion system at 30 % throttle gradually decreases, resulting in a reduction in the energy consumption gain of the hybrid propulsion system as the throttle increases.
For amphibious spherical robots operating in field environments, cruising range and endurance time serve as two critical performance indicators. The proposed MPS-ASR prototype in this study is equipped with a 2400 Wh lithium-ion battery system. Systematic calculations were performed to evaluate the endurance characteristics under different throttle conditions for both propeller propulsion and hybrid propulsion systems. Comparative analysis of the endurance duration and cruising range enhancement diagrams reveals a consistent pattern: the hybrid propulsion system demonstrated inferior endurance performance compared to the pure propeller system across all throttle levels. Notably, this performance gap gradually diminished with increasing throttle levels, showing an asymptotic convergence trend at higher power outputs.
Through comparative analysis of propulsion performance between the hybrid propulsion system and the con-ventional screw propeller configuration, experimental results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The hybrid propulsion system achieves hydrodynamic efficiency comparable to that of traditional screw propellers while offering additional benefits derived from the pendulum-based propulsion mechanism, particularly improved resistance to stranding during amphibious operations. This synergistic integration enhances the amphibious locomotion adaptability of the MPS-ASR platform, with its kinematic performance exhibiting clear advantages in maintaining effective transit velocity across diverse terrain conditions.
Synthesizing the performance data, a holistic analysis of the hybrid propulsion mode reveals its core characteristics, tactical advantages, and inherent trade-offs. The primary characteristic of this system is the synergistic integration of two complementary propulsion mechanisms: conventional propeller-based thrust for rapid locomotion and pendulum-induced rolling for stability and obstacle negotiation. From this design emerge two principal advantages: 1) a significant enhancement in environmental adaptability, particularly the ability to mitigate stranding, and 2) the retention of high-speed and high-maneuverability performance crucial for open-water transit. Conversely, these benefits are accompanied by a clear disadvantage in the form of a performance trade-off in energy efficiency. The hybrid mode's substantially higher energy consumption, especially at lower throttles, directly reduces the robot's endurance and cruising range. This represents a deliberate design choice, prioritizing operational versatility and robustness over maximal energy economy. Ultimately, this balanced assessment confirms the hybrid system's practical value for complex amphibious missions, while transparently acknowledging its associated operational costs.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we propose a novel amphibious spherical robot equipped with a multi-modal propulsion system(MPS- ASR), and systematically investigate its various propulsion modes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was employed to analyze the thrust and open-water performance of the propeller propulsion system, with the results validated against experimental thrust measurements. A dynamic model for the pendulum propulsion mode was developed using the Lagrangian method, and its motion speed was predicted through MATLAB simulations, showing excellent agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, CFD-based motion resistance and speed predictions were conducted for both propeller and hybrid propulsion modes, enabling a comprehensive comparison of their motion performance. To validate the field performance of the MPS-ASR, field experiments were conducted, comparing the motion performance across different propulsion modes. The following conclusions can be drawn.
(1)
The MATLAB-simulated motion speed for the pendulum propulsion mode demonstrated less than 5 % error compared to experimental measurements, confirming the accuracy of the dynamic model and its parameters.
(2)
In the propeller propulsion mode, the discrepancy between simulated and measured motion resistance decreased with increasing propeller speed, reaching a minimum error of 2 %. Similarly, the error in motion speed prediction decreased with higher propeller speeds, achieving a minimum error of 1 %.
(3)
Field experiments validated the simulation results and revealed that below 30 % propeller throttle, the hybrid propulsion system achieves velocity increases at a substantial energy cost, with energy consumption exceeding 150 % of the propeller-only system. Above 30 % propeller throttle, the velocity difference between the two propulsion systems remains within 5 %, consistent with simulation predictions. This demonstrates that the hybrid propulsion system maintains high-speed performance while enhancing environmental adaptability, providing critical data support for practical applications requiring both versatility and efficiency.
From the technical application level, the experimental data verified that the hybrid propulsion can maintain 95–97 % pure screw speed above 30 % throttle, while achieving the following objectives.
i.
Environmental robustness: Enhanced grounding resistance and terrain adaptability from pendulum propulsion.
ii.
Operational flexibility: Preserved high-speed capability inherent to screw propulsion.
iii.
Predictable performance: <5 % velocity variance threshold aligns -with simulation models.
These findings provide critical empirical support for implementing hybrid propulsion in practical amphibious applications where environmental adaptability and speed retention are paramount, despite the inherent energy consumption tradeoffs.
These findings provide a solid foundation for the practical implementation of the amphibious spherical robot equipped with a multi-modal propulsion system, highlighting its potential in diverse operational scenarios. Compared to other multi-modal amphibious robots, the hybrid propulsion mode in this study not only maintains the high speed of the propeller propulsion mode but also offers the advantages of rolling motion from the pendulum propulsion system (overcoming sudden stranding and water surface obstacles). Additionally, its energy consumption is comparable to that of the single-mode propeller propulsion, demonstrating the dual-mode advantages while maintaining the energy efficiency of the single-mode system. The comprehensive methodology adopted in this study—combining CFD simulations,
MATLAB-based dynamic modeling, and open-water field testing—ensures both theoretical rigor and practical validation of the proposed hybrid propulsion system. The integration of numerical and experimental approaches provides deeper insights into the hydrodynamic performance and hybrid dynamics ofthe MPS-ASR, while enhancing the reliability and applicability of the research outcomes.
Although useful conclusions were drawn from comparing the performance of the two propulsion systems (propeller-only and hybrid propulsion) and three propulsion modes, there are still some limitations. For instance, the thrust testing of the propeller system could be further improved by enhancing the thrust devices and testing conditions, which would increase the accuracy of the measurements. Furthermore, testing the amphibious spherical robot in marine environments would provide more precise insights into the propeller's performance and highlight areas for improvement. In future work, our team plans to conduct further in-depth studies, including testing the dual propulsion system in various environments such as sea trials and marshland tests. We also aim to develop autonomous switching functionality for the dual propulsion system, allowing the MPS-ASR to operate under the most optimal propulsion strategy at all times.

I. Justification of the Effective Rolling Constraint Assumption
This section clarifies the kinematic constraint applied in our Lagrangian formulation, which defines the relationship between the sphere's translation and rotation (xs = R). This is distinct from a strict no-slip condition at the fluid-solid interface in the microscopic sense.
1
Rationale as a Modeling Simplification and Drive Mechanism:
The primary purpose of this assumption is to establish a tractable mathematical relationship between the sphere's angular velocity and its translational velocity, which is central to developing a control-oriented Lagrangian model. This approach captures the system's dominant dynamics without the complexity of full fluid-structure interaction simulations. Furthermore, our robot utilizes an internal pendulum drive mechanism. This design inherently aims to propel the sphere by generating a rolling motion through shifts in the center of mass, making rolling (as opposed to sliding) the intended and primary mode of motion.
2
Quantitative Justification via Reynolds Number and Boundary Layer Analysis:
To quantitatively support this simplification, we analyzed the hydrodynamic regime. Based on our experimental conditions (water at ∼10。C), we calculated a Reynolds number (Re) of approximately 1.6 × 105 for the robot at its maximum velocity (0.239 m/s). While this Re value indicates inertia-dominated flow overall, the viscous forces within the boundary layer adjacent to the sphere's surface remain significant. These viscous shear stresses provide substantial resistance against significant slipping between the sphere surface and the water, making the “effective rolling" constraint a physically well-founded approximation for the macroscopic dynamics. Importantly, this simplification captures the system's dominant behavior without needing to model detailed slip effects, which are negligible under typical operating conditions.
3
Model Robustness Across Operating Temperatures:
Our analysis shows that even at higher water temperatures (e.g., 30。C), the Reynolds number (Re ≈ 2.4 × 105) remains below the critical value for the drag crisis (≈3.5 × 105 for smooth spheres (Choi et al., 2006)). This confirms that the viscous effects continue to play a significant role across the typical operating temperature range, ensuring the robustness of our modeling assumption under different environmental conditions. Given that the flow remains viscous-dominated in this range, the assumption of rolling motion without significant slipping holds reliably.
4
Final Validation via Experimental Data and Parameterization:
The most compelling evidence for the assumption's practical utility is the strong agreement (errors under 5 %) between our model-based simulations and the physical experimental results (Table 5). This agreement indicates that the model, with its rolling constraint, successfully captures the essential energy relationships and dynamics. Any minor energy losses or effects due to localized slip are likely lumped into and compensated by our empirically derived hydrodynamic parameter (τwater), which is identified from experimental data. This approach ensures that the model remains accurate and predictive even in the presence of small slip effects.
II. Resistance Analysis under Propeller Propulsion and Hybrid Propulsion Modes
It is important to clarify that the term “resistance" in this study refers exclusively to the translational hydrodynamic resistance experienced by the MPS-ASR during forward motion, excluding the rotational resistance generated by the spherical shell under the hybrid propulsion mode. To illustrate the differences between propulsion modes, a representative simulation case with a propeller rotational speed of 1800 RPM is selected (Fig. 26).
The velocity distribution results (Fig. 26(a)) reveal significant differences between the two modes. Under pure propeller propulsion, large high-velocity regions tightly envelop the robot, with the highest velocities concentrated in the wake region. In contrast, hybrid propulsion results in reduced high-velocity areas, primarily concentrated near the front of the robot, forming a distinct triangular region. This is attributed to the rotational motion of the spherical shell, which drives the flow forward along the shell surface. Moreover, hybrid propulsion produces a shorter, lower-velocity wake, indicating reduced fluid disturbance and energy loss, whereas pure propeller propulsion generates a long, high-speed wake that demands greater energy for acceleration.
The vorticity distributions (Fig. 26(b)) further confirm these trends. In hybrid mode, high vorticity is confined to the spherical shell surface and frontal region, with low-vorticity, stable wake structures, suggesting delayed flow separation and reduced drag. By contrast, the pure propeller mode produces intense wake vorticity, indicating severe separation and larger pressure differentials, increasing overall resistance.
Pressure distribution analysis (Fig. 26(c)) supports these observations. Hybrid propulsion creates high-pressure zones along both the front and rear surfaces of the shell, delaying separation and minimizing the pressure differential. Pure propeller propulsion fails to form an effective high-pressure barrier at the front, and rear pressure recovery is insufficient, intensifying reverse flow and increasing resistance. These findings align with classical hydrodynamic theory (Saffman, 1995; Blevins, 1977; Schlichting and Gersten, 2016).
The wall shear stress distributions (Fig. 26(d)) further highlight the differences. Hybrid propulsion generates significantly higher shear stress, peaking at 256 Pa at the shell's bottom and covering most of the shell surface. This indicates strong fluid-surface coupling and effective control of boundary layer separation. In contrast, pure propeller propulsion results in low shear stress over much of the shell, with localized peaks near the propellers (15.3 Pa), implying poor flow control and significant separation. While hybrid propulsion introduces higher frictional drag due to increased wall shear stress, it effectively reduces pressure drag by suppressing separation. As pressure drag dominates the total resistance of bluff bodies (Hoerner, 1965), the overall resistance under hybrid propulsion is lower than that under pure propeller propulsion. However, the added rotational motion of the shell increases energy consumption, which may offset some of the resistance benefits.
III. Mesh and Time Independence Analysis
To further verify mesh independence and time step independence while considering the available computational resources of our team, we selected the hybrid propulsion mode at a propeller rotational speed of 1800 RPM as a representative test case. Systematic independence tests have been performed under this condition with detailed data and analysis provided in Fig. 27.
A.
Mesh Independence Test:
The test result as detailed in Fig. 27(a).To quantitatively assess mesh independence, we selected the medium mesh (Base Size 20 mm) as the reference case and calculated the relative errors for each parameter. The results are summarized as follows: Compared to the extra-fine mesh, the resistance and thrust predictions of the fine mesh differ by approximately 3–4 %. Further mesh refinement from 15 mm to 12 mm results in diminishing changes in thrust and drag coefficient, indicating a gradual convergence trend. Considering the balance between computational cost and simulation accuracy, the medium mesh (3.28 million cells) provides a reasonable compromise. Moreover, the variation between the medium and finer meshes remains within an acceptable engineering tolerance range <5 % (generally considered within 5–10 %).
B.
Time Independence Test:
The test result is detailed in Fig. 27(b). To quantitatively assess time step independence, we selected the baseline time step (0.01 s, adopted in this paper) as the reference case and calculated the relative errors for each parameter. The results are summarized as follows: Compared to the fine time step (0.005 s), the resistance and thrust predictions obtained using a moderate time step (0.0075 s) differ by approximately 1–2 %. Further reducing the time step from 0.0075 s to 0.005 s results in minimal changes in hydrodynamic parameters, indicating a gradual convergence trend. In contrast, using a coarser time step (0.02 s) leads to noticeable deviations in velocity, resistance, and thrust, confirming that excessively large time steps introduce significant temporal discretization errors. Considering the balance between computational cost and simulation accuracy, the baseline time step of 0.01 sprovides a reasonable compromise. Moreover, the variation between the baseline and finer time steps remains within an acceptable engineering tolerance range (maximum error <7 %), which is generally considered acceptable in CFD practice.
C.
Conclusion:
The mesh independence test and the time step independence test confirms that the mesh scheme adopted and the time step scheme adopted in this paper is reasonable and provides reliable numerical results.
IV. Analysis of Large Thrust Prediction Errors at Low Rotational Speeds
Massive errors—up to 1194 %—were observed in thrust predictions at low rotational speeds. To better understand the origin of these discrepancies, we conducted a detailed analysis. Several possible factors were identified as primary contributors to the error.
a.
Suitability of the SST K − 
 Turbulence Model: As mentioned in the literature (Wu et al., 2023) “The calculation accuracy of SST K− 
 is the highest according to the commonly used turbulence tests and the previous calculation experience." This provides strong evidence supporting the validity and appropriateness of the turbulence model employed in our study.
b.
Mesh Resolution Effects: Although a mesh independence study has been conducted, under low-speed, low-thrust conditions, the boundary layer and wake regions near the propeller contribute more significantly to thrust generation. Insufficient mesh resolution in these critical areas may therefore introduce additional errors.
c.
Experimental Uncertainty: At low thrust levels, measurement uncertainties tend to be magnified. Factors such as sensor resolution, environmental disturbances, or structural mounting effects may reduce the accuracy of experimental data, thus affecting the comparison with simulation results.
d.
Simplified Modeling Assumptions: The current numerical model does not account for structural components such as the propeller shaft, supporting structures, and vehicle frame. These elements present in the experiments may reduce actual thrust, whereas the simulation represents idealized open-water performance, leading to an apparent overestimation of thrust compared to experimental data.
To further investigate the above-mentioned issues, we conducted the following additional tests.
1.
Mesh Refinement in the Wake and Rotating Domains:
We first fixed the wake mesh size and gradually refined the mesh in the cylindrical rotating domain from 0.01 m (baseline in this study) down to 0.005 m. The results (Fig. 28) indicate that reducing the mesh size initially decreases the thrust error, but further refinement to 0.005 m unexpectedly increases the error. Based on this, we selected 0.008 m as the optimal mesh size and subsequently refined the conical wake region. We found that decreasing the wake mesh size from 0.002 m to 0.0015 m led to the smallest thrust error, but further refinement to 0.001 m significantly increased both cell count (by an order of magnitude) and thrust error. These results suggest that the mesh configuration used in this study is reasonably optimized and not the dominant factor contributing to large thrust errors.
2.
Increased Prism Layers in the Rotating Domain:
Using the optimal mesh from the previous tests, we varied the number of prism layers in the rotating domain (Fig. 29). The results show that increasing the prism layers beyond the current setup actually worsens thrust error, and excessive layering (15 layers) even causes simulation divergence. This further confirms the appropriateness of our current near-wall treatment.
3.
Adjustment of Relaxation Factors in the Rotating Domain:
Finally, we tested different velocity and pressure relaxation factors based on the above-optimized mesh and prism layers (Fig. 30). The results indicate that none of the tested combinations significantly reduced the thrust error, demonstrating that our current settings are reasonable.
In conclusion, based on the above systematic tests, the mesh configuration, near-wall treatment, and solver settings employed in this study have been comprehensively evaluated and optimized. The large errors in low-RPM thrust predictions are primarily attributed to the inherent sensitivity of low thrust values to both experimental uncertainty and structural effects not modeled in the simulation. It is also noteworthy that at higher RPMs, where thrust values are larger, the relative errors between simulation and experiment are significantly reduced — dropping to 27.4 % at the highest tested RPM — demonstrating the reliability and practical applicability of our numerical model in the main operating range.
