Abstract
The objective of this study is to enhance the flow and thermal performances of cold plates used for battery heat dissipation. Therefore, novel topology-optimized cold plates are obtained by topology optimization methods with non-uniform heat as the heat generated by batteries since the temperature of the surface of the cell after discharge is non-uniform, which is different from the conventional topology-optimized cold plates. This non-uniform heat is calculated by Newman, Tiedemann, Gu, and Kim model. Then, the flow and thermal performances of various topological cold plates are numerically investigated. The results show that new topology optimized cold plates are superior to the conventional cold plate in temperature uniformity. At the same flow rate, the maximum heat transfer coefficient of the optimized plate is improved by 26%, and the maximum temperature deviation is reduced by 20% compared to the conventional one. Additionally, the influences of channel depths and flow rates on the cooling performance of optimized plates are numerically studied. Finally, experimental tests are conducted to affirm the reliability of the numerical results.

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase of total number of automobiles. The conventional automotive industry has been a source of environmental pollution, which contributing to the greenhouse effect. The use of batteries as the primary power source for vehicles offers a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which offers a preferred choice for an expanding consumer base [1]. Rechargeable pouch-type lithium-ion batteries, known for their robust stability and high energy efficiency, have been found extensive applications in new energy vehicles [2]. However, the battery's internal resistance and chemical reaction generate more heat, which may result in the temperature of cells may be out of the range of 20 °C∼40 °C and the temperature difference among the cells above 5 °C. In extreme cases, catastrophic events such as fires may occur, so timely intervention is critical to prevent thermal runaway of the batteries [3].
The thermal management of batteries typically involves active cooling and passive cooling. Utilizing water cooling, air cooling, and phase-change materials (PCM) are major cooling methods [4], [5], [6]. Air cooling characterized by its cost-effectiveness and eliminating the fluid leakage, has been widely used. However, since the limitation for air cooling is apparent due to lower thermal conductivity, the required temperature operation conditions for batteries may not be satisfied at higher discharge rates [7]. Phase change cooling is used to absorb the heat from the battery through latent heat, which stands out as a robust solution. However, the thermal conductivity of phase change materials is relatively poor. Moreover, the heat stored within the phase change material faces challenges in dissipating the heat for multiple charge/discharge cycles of batteries [8], [9]. At the same time, the high cost and restricted melting point range of PCMs have significant drawbacks in practical applications [10].
Liquid cooling is a widely adopted cooling method, which has been extensively studied [11]. Water, being a ubiquitously available and cost-effective medium with a high specific heat capacity, has become the preference for many researchers [12], [13], [14], [15]. Xie et al. proposed a bionic liquid cooling plate for improving the temperature uniformity of batteries, and reported that the new cooling plate has better cooling performance and lower energy consumption [16]. Furthermore, there are reports suggesting that the use of ethanol as cooling mediums can maintain better thermal uniformity in specific working environments. In the study of Rezk et al., the thermal performance of the system was enhanced using ethanol as the working fluid [17].
As commonly acknowledged, the geometric parameters of the cold plate are crucial to the heat transfer efficiency. The straight channels are the main type channels of the cold plate used for heat dissipation of batteries [18], [19], [20]. Beyond straight channels, different design structures, such as serpentine channels and biomimetic channels, are also employed. Wang et al. designed a biomimetic cold plate inspired by spider web structures and optimized it using orthogonal experiments [21]. Zhang et al. designed a novel biomimetic finned cold plate using a multi-objective optimization method, and reported that the optimized optimal model reduces the average temperature and pressure drop by 1.69 °C and 6.81 Pa, respectively [22].
However, these channels often have a limited design freedom and depend on the experience of designers. Topology optimization is a computer-based method that automatically produces fluid channels based on defined goals and constraints. This provides high degrees of freedom, which is not constrained by the experience of researchers [23]. In recent years, with the advancement of additive manufacturing technology with lower cost of making topological channels, topological cooling plates have been used [24], [25], [26]. Liu et al. designed two novel types of cold plates with distinct functional characteristics to address the issues of battery temperature uniformity and pressure drop [27]. A multi-objective topology optimization model with optimal comprehensive performance was proposed by Wang et al. Their results showed that topology optimization design can effectively enhance the comprehensive performance fact [28].
Based on the studies above literature, conventional cold plates are designed by topological optimization with uniform heat sources, which improves the performance of cold plates effectively. However, the actual generated heat of the batteries is non-uniform, which leads to the temperature of the hot spots for batteries has not been effectively reduced. In order to solve this problem, this work presents a new topology optimization method considering the actual heat production of lithium-ion batteries, which is considered inhomogeneous heat of batteries after discharge. This non-uniform heat is calculated by NTGK model. To determine the key parameters of NTGK model, we carry out the discharge experiment of batteries. Then, the topological optimization is performed with this non-uniform source. Furthermore, the flow and thermal performances of cooling plates are evaluated numerically. Finally, an experimental test is carried out to verify the numerical results.

2.2. Model analysis
Numerical simulation emerges as a powerful tool for predicting the thermal behavior of batteries, offering the substantial advantages of saving experimental time and reducing practical workload. In the Numerical simulation, the generated heat of the batteries are crucial to the numerical results. Various electrochemical models, including the NTGK(Newman, Tiedemann, Gu, and Kim model) model, the Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM), and the pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) model, are available for calculating the heat of batteries [30], [31], [32]. Among these, the NTGK model has the advantages of rapid-solving speed and excellent compatibility with experimental results. As a result, NTGK model is a preferred choice for determining the heat in the numerical study of thermal performance of lithium-ion batteries.
2.3. The electrochemical model control equations
The NTGK model is an efficient approach for modeling lithium-ion batteries, allowing for a rapid solution to the thermal performance of batteries [33], [34], [35]. The integrating model of the batteries with the electrochemical model enables the interpretation of the actual current flux. The transport equations for the positive and negative electrode current flux of the battery can be presented as follows:
(1)

 is the phase potential of the negative electrode, and 
 is the volume transfer current rate of the electrochemical reaction. To obtain the heat generated by discharging the battery, the thermal and electric fields of the battery need to be coupled. Neglecting the impact of mixing and enthalpy terms, the energy conservation equation for the battery can be obtained [34]:
(3)
where 
,

 and 
 are two functions of the Depth of Discharge (DoD). The heat of electrochemical reaction can be calculated as [35]:
(6)
where the first term of the right-hand side of Eq.(6) is the heat generated by overpotential, which is an irreversible process, while the second term of the right-hand side of Eq.(6) is the heat generated by entropic heating, which is a reversible process. Therefore, the total heat generated for batteries can be expressed as:
(7)
where the newly added term of Eq.(7) on the right side is the ohmic heat generated by the internal resistance of the battery. The depth of discharge (DoD) of the battery can be calculated as:

3. Topology-Optimized design models
This Section introduces the topology optimization with a non-uniform heat source. Then, the material distribution is obtained by using the commercial software COMSOL for the specified design domain. The topology optimization model uses the SIMP interpolation function to express the physical properties of the two materials [36]. Furthermore, an optimization model that considers both heat transfer and flow properties is developed.
3.1. Description of the topological problem
The optimization problem is represented as the distribution of porous dielectric material at different locations in a stationary design domain. The material distribution in the design domain is defined using a design variable γ. When γ is 0, which denotes the solid domain. The heat flux 
 is set to be non-uniform, which is adjusted using a custom function related to the location of design domains. The topology optimized design domain used is shown in Fig. 2. The length (Ly) of the design domain is 160 mm and the width (Lx) is 150 mm. All the inlets and outlets have the same width (w) with the value of 10 mm, and the distance(d) between the neighbor inlet and outlet is 65 mm. The inlet fluid temperature (Tin) is 298.15 K, and the outlet pressure P0 is the standard atmospheric pressure.

3.2. Fluid flow models
Assuming that the fluid is incompressible and the flow is laminar, the continuity equation and momentum conservation equation can be expressed as [37]:
(11)
(12)
where ∇ represents the gradient operator. ρ, u, P, μ denote the density, velocity vector, pressure, and coefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid, respectively. F is the frictional resistance to simulate fluid flow in a porous medium. According to Darcy’s Law, the definition of frictional force is:
(13)
where α represents the drag coefficient, which is a dimensionless and continuous function intricately linked to the design variable γ. This drag coefficient can be expressed as [38]:
(14)
(15)
Where L is the characteristic length, Da is the Darcy number, and αmax represents the maximum permeability in the porous medium. If γ = 0, the material can be deemed as solid, namely. If γ = 1, the material is fluid.
3.3. Topology optimization model
Using the SIMP interpolation function, the physical properties of the solid and liquid phases can be unified into a single equation. The material properties to be interpolated include thermal conductivity, density and constant pressure specific heat capacity. The corresponding interpolation functions are as follows [29]:
(16)
(17)
(18)
where k is the thermal conductivity, 
 is the specific heat capacity and 
 is the density. The penalty factor acts on the material interpolation function to reduce the generation of gray cells by transforming the shape of the interpolation function.
3.4. Heat transfer model
Assuming that the heat transfer process is in a steady state, and the material properties remain stable, we can reset up the energy equation as [39]:
(19)
(20)
where Q is the heat generation, and T represents the temperature. Assuming the existence of an ideal heat source TQ, we can express the heat generation per unit area Q on a uniform surface based on the Cooling Law of Newton as [37], [39]:
(21)
where h is the heat transfer coefficient. When analyzing the surface temperature profile of a battery in contact with a cooling plate after discharge, it is evident that the surface temperature of the battery is non-uniform at the end of discharge. To implement a non-uniform topology optimization method, this can be combined with a heat source term related to the surface temperature obtained by numerical study the performance of batteries with NTGK determining the heat. The heat generation Q can be described as:
(22)
where P(x, y) is a jointly fitted function of the temperature distribution at each location on the heat source surface. P*(x*, y*) are dimensionless function. Assume x* = x/x0, y* = y/y0 and 
 = P(x, y) /P0. The values of x0, y0, P0 are 1 mm, 1 mm, 1 K. The function P(x, y) can be defined as:
(23)
where the values of x ,y are in the range of −Lx/2 ≤ x ≤ Lx/2 and −Ly/2 ≤ y ≤ Ly/2, respectively. The function is generated using MATLAB fitting, and the superiority of the fitted function can be evaluated using the regression evaluation metrics R-Square and RMSE:
(24)
(25)
where Ni represents the actual value, Pi is the predicted value of the function, and n is the total number of input data. It is considered better when the R-Square value approaches 1, namely, the RMSE value is smaller. In this study, the value of RMSE is 0.01736, and that of R-Square is 0.9985. These results suggest that the function generated by the fitting process closely aligns with the actual values. To counterbalance the uneven heat transfer between the two sides of the cold plate, an additional function is introduced to amplify the non-uniformity of the heat source:
(26)
where b is a dimensionless constant with the value of 225. Therefore, the actual heat source function is defined as:
(27)
3.5. Density model
The replacement of unstable values with stable values using density filters can improve the stability of the numerical solution process. The Helmholtz filter is formulated as [37]:
(28)
(29)
where r is the filter radius, 
 is the design variable before filtering and γ is the design variable after filtering. The use of tangent projection can reduce the gray cells generated. The function formula can be gotten as follows [40]:
(30)
where 
 is the hyperbolic tangent projection point, and 
 is the projection slope.
3.6. Optimization objective functions
The heat transfer and flow performances are important indicators for evaluating a cold plate. The magnitude of the flow performance is determined by the power dissipation, which can be characterized as the minimum total potential energy. The performance evaluation can be expressed as [41]:
(31)
The heat transfer performance of the cooling plate can be defined by two functions 
 and 
. These functions 
 and 
 can be determined as follows:
(32)
(33)
where Ω is the design domain. In order to balance these two metrics, the multi-objective function of the topology optimization is defined as two normalized objectives using a combination of power functions. The objective functions can be expressed as [41]:
(34)
where 
 and 
 are the initial values of the objective functions, 
 is the weighting factor of the multi-objective function, which determines the preference of heat transfer efficiency/mobility performance in the final optimization results generated. Some of the control parameters used in the topological optimization model are defined in Table 3. The specific values of the solid and fluid thermal performance parameters used in the topology optimization process are shown in Table 4. In summary, the optimization problem can be constructed as:

The design variables are updated using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) algorithm to find the optimal solution of the optimization problem on a global scale. The optimization process is evaluated by finite element analysis, and the convergence of the optimization results is achieved by using the accompanying matrix method. If the gap between the final two adjacent optimization results is less than 1 × 10-6, the optimization process is terminated; Otherwise, the above steps are repeated.
3.7. Optimization results
Uniform and non-Uniform typologies are realized by different heat production conditions while ensuring the same boundary conditions. Fig. 3 shows the final results of the optimization, where the blue area represents the fluid. We name these different topology channels as UTM1, UTM2, NTM1, NTM2. The obtained topology-optimized result is divided into four regions. Then, the percentage of the overall fluid region is calculated for each region, which is presented in Table 5. It can be seen that the higher temperature regions (C and D) for the non-uniform typologies (NTM1 and NTM2) have more fluid than those regions for uniform typologies (UTM1 and UTM2). The topology optimization results are then stretched to generate 3D models for subsequent simulation.

4. Three-Dimensional numerical modeling
4.1. Design of control equations for three-dimensional models
In the numerical study, some assumptions need to be made: the coolant is continuous and incompressible, and the physical parameters of the fluid do not change with the temperature. On the other hand, the flow is laminar. The continuity, momentum and energy equations for the coolant can be written [42]:

The inlet boundary conditions are:
(43)
The outlet boundary condition is:

For the fluid–solid interface:
(45)
(46)
Using the battery as a heat source for the cold plate, the bottom of the heat sink is:
(47)
The remaining surfaces is:
(48)
The discharge multiplier of the battery is 3C. When the voltage of the battery reaches the cut-off voltage, the discharge stops. The external ambient temperature is 298.15 K. The battery is in a closed environment, so the effect of thermal radiation and convection are ignored. At the same time we set the residuals of the continuity, flow velocities and energy equations to 10-5, 10-5 and 10-6, respectively.
4.3. Parameter definition
The ability of the cooling plate to balance the temperature can be assessed using the temperature uniformity of the cell. During discharge, the battery temperature uniformity can be calculated as:
(49)
where 
 is the volume of the battery module and T is the average temperature of the battery surface. The temperature standard deviation 
 is used to represent the temperature gradient at the cell surface [45]:
(50)
The heat generated by the battery is conducted to the cold plate and carried away by the coolant, which can be expressed as:
(51)
The total heat removed by the coolant can be calculated as:
(52)
where 
 is the mass flow rate of the coolant, Tin and Tout are the inlet and outlet temperatures, respectively. The average convective heat transfer coefficient can be determined by Eq. (53)[26].
(53)
(54)
where Asur is the contact surface area between the coolant and cold plate, 
 is the average temperature of the wall, and 
 is the fluid average temperature of the inlet and outlet temperature, which can be defined as:
(55)
where 
 is the average fluid temperature at all inlets and 
 is the average fluid temperature at all outlets. The average Nussle number can be defined as [27]:
(56)
where Dh is the hydraulic diameter, which can be expressed as:
(57)
where w and h are the width and height of channels, respectively. Notably, the width w and h for all channels are the same. The flow characteristics of a fluid can be expressed in terms of pumping power. This pumping power can be calculated as [42]:
(58)
The friction factor can be determined [46]:
(59)
where L is the length of the fluid in the flow direction. The heat transfer performance of a cooling plate can be evaluated using the 
 factor, and the larger this value, the better the heat transfer capability of the cooling plate when multiple cooling plates are compared [42]. While the 
 factor can be expressed as follows:
(60)
where Re is the fluid Reynolds number, and Pr is the Prandtl Number. The cooling performance of the cooling plates can be calculated as:
(61)
The larger the value, the better the cooling performance of the module [47].
4.4. Grid independence verifications
In the quest for precise simulation outcomes, grid independence becomes a focal point, which is tested by scrutinizing the average temperature, pressure drop, and friction factor of the three-dimensional cooling plate model (UTM1). Unstructured tetrahedral grids are meticulously crafted in varying numbers (1,341,897, 1,875,709, 2,391,220, 3,209,012, 4,388,105, 5,489,783, 6,322,246). Fig. 4 unveils the outcomes of the independence test for the inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s when the battery discharged. It conveys that as the grid count reaches 3.21 × 106, the numerical data settles into a state of equilibrium. The results of grid independence tests are shown in Fig. 4. The oscillations in Nu, f and ΔP induced by grid nuances beneath 15 % with the 6.32 × 106 grid system as reference. This suggests that the simulation results obtained from the test have only a small deviation from the accurate values when the grid number is more than 3.21 × 106 grids. This error is within an acceptable range. To balance computational precision and temporal efficiency, we select 3.21 × 106 grids system for subsequent numerical simulations.

4.5. Discussion of the results
The topological result is shown in Fig. 3. a and b are the uniform and non-uniform topologies generated by the objective function 
, respectively. While c and d are the uniform and non-uniform topologies generated by the objective function 
. It's crucial to note that the randomly generated channels within the topological region might contact with the external environment. To mitigate this, a delicate framework is introduced. The numerical simulation unfolds in three dimensions, wherein the initially generated two-dimensional topological channel structure is stretched a three-dimensional model shown in Fig. 5. Concurrently, a traditional cooling plate is shown in in Fig. 6. The liquid volume fraction of the traditional cooling plate and the inlet and outlet arrangement are similar to the typologies.

4.6. Validation of numerical values
To ascertain the superiority of the topological optimization method in comparison to the performance of traditional straight channels while considering the model's symmetry and complexity, the numerical study is performed by ANSYS FLUENT code.
4.6.1. Flow characteristics
Simulation is meticulously executed at the inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s and the discharge rate of 3C. Fig. 7 shows the temporal variations of both average and maximum temperatures for all cold plates. The growth trends of different curves exhibit relative similarity, while the average and maximum cell surface temperatures are higher than those of the topological optimization channels. This indicates that the channels obtained by using non-uniform heat during topology optimization can decease the hot spot temperature of the battery.

Fig. 7. Comparisons of the Tave and Tmax for different cooling plates.

In Fig. 8, a comprehensive comparison of relevant performances for different cooling plates is presented. Notably, the topological cold plates consistently outperforms the conventional cold plates in terms of average surface temperature, indicating the superior heat transfer performance of the topological optimization cold plates. Interestingly, the NTM topological channel exhibits lower average surface temperature compared to the UTM topological optimization cold plates, suggesting that the adoption of a non-uniform heat in the topological optimization process results in topological channels with more effective heat dissipation ability compared to traditional topological structures. Furthermore, the friction factor of the topological cooling plates is slightly higher than that of the cooling plates with straight channels. This can be attributed to more complex secondary channels are generated during the topological process. At the inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s, the topological channels induce more local resistance, causing the fluid to expend more energy, consequently leading to higher pressure drop.

Fig. 8. Comparison of evaluation parameters for five cooling plates at the inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s.

The two types of topological channels (UTM1 and UTM2) exhibit a relatively more efficient dissipation ability due to a reduction of the generated secondary channels compared to the NTM. Notably, the cooling plate with straight channels displays lower pressure drop. This is because at the inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s, the fluid in the conventional cooling plate traverses fewer bends, resulting in reduced energy consumption compared to the topological optimization channels. The thermal performances for different cold plates at the same flow rate are given in Table 8. It can be seen that the maximum heat transfer coefficient of the topological cold plate is increased by 26 %, while the maximum temperature deviation is reduced by 20 % compared to conventional cold plates.

Fig. 9 shows the ultimate cell surface temperatures after the discharge of the battery with various cold plates. Near the inlet of the channel, the coolant temperature is lower, so it can effectively carry away most of the heat generated by the battery. However, as the distance from the channel entrance increases in length, the coolant absorbs heat, causing the rise of fluid temperature leading to the diminishing the cooling efficiency. Concurrently, a thermal buildup area appears at the center of the cell. Asymmetry in the amount of inlets and outlets on both sides of the cooling plate results in a shift of the heat towards the pole piece position. The origin of this hot spot is attributed to the increase of the fluid temperature. At the center of the cold plate, the cross-section of the channel becomes larger, which slows down the velocity. This is also one of the reasons for the generation of the hot zone. Moreover, this phenomenon of higher temperature inside the cold plates is particularly obvious in that with straight channels.

Moreover, due to the occurrence of electrochemical heat reactions at the tab position and the absence of the coolant, the higher temperature at the electrode tab position may be found. The temperature distribution of topology cold plate design with the uniform heat exhibits approximately symmetrical patterns on both sides in consequence of the intrinsic channel structure.
The velocity distribution is depicted in Fig. 10. Notably, the larger fluid flow rate and narrower channel cross-sections at the inlets and outlets result in the increase of velocities, whereas the velocity of central part of the cooling plate decreases as the channel cross-section widens, which enhances the formation of hot spots. In the case of straight channels, there is a relatively uniform fluid velocity; however, the fluid in this channels prematurely flows out of the heat sink, resulting in suboptimal heat dissipation. At the same time, the uneven inlet and outlet arrangement on both sides introducing the fluid into the side channels, causing the smaller velocity in the middle channels. This contributes to an uneven temperature distribution of the conventional cooling plate.

The thermal performance of these cold plates is measured for the Reynolds number ranging from 50 to 400, as illustrated in Fig. 11. Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b) show that with the growth of Reynolds number, both the average temperature and temperature deviation of the battery exhibit a declining trend. For lower Reynolds number, the change of temperature manifest most dramatically. Concurrently, it's that with the augmentation of Reynolds number, the change of temperature variation gradually decelerates. This underscores that a mere elevation in Reynolds number significantly influences the cooling performance of the cooling plate up to a certain extent. However, as Reynolds number continues ascent, the cooling ability of the cooling plate reaches a specific threshold.

Fig. 11. Performance variation curves for different cold plates at different Re.

Fig. 11(c) and (d) show the variations of pressure drop and friction factor with increasing Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number ascends, all cooling plates exhibit an approximate exponential surge in pressure drop and friction factor. The relationship between Reynolds number and cooling performance is nonlinear and dynamic. Therefore, selecting an appropriate Reynolds number is crucial to balance the surface temperature of the cold plate and the power consumption of the pump.
The specific values of pressure drop and temperature deviation for different Reynolds number are presented in Table 9. It may be observed that the optimized model has a superior ability to equilibrate the pressure drop compared to TSM. A maximum reduction of 61.96 % of pressure drop for the optimized model is found in comparison to TSM. Meanwhile, the temperature difference for all cold plates decreases with the increase of Reynolds number. At the same time, the maximum temperature deviation of the optimized cooling plate can be reduced by 33.48 %.

Furthermore, based on the above conclusions, it can be clearly observed that NTM2 has superior performance. Consequently, NTM2 is chosen for further experimental exploration.
4.6.2. The impact of channel depths
Since the cooling plates designed by topological optimization may be affected by different channel depths, the topological optimization is carried out for various topological channel depths of NTM2. The numerical topological cold plates with the channel depth ranging from 3 mm to 7 mm are shown in Fig. 12. With the inlet coolant flow rate of 3 × 10-3 Kg s−1 and a consistent discharge rate for the battery, the effect of channel depths on the thermal behaviors of the battery are represented in Fig. 13.

Fig. 13. Effect of cooling plate depths on Tavg, ΔT, Tσ of the battery.

Fig. 13 shows that the dynamic temperature changes with the channel depth. Noteworthy, the mean temperature of the battery is incessant increasing, which tends to stability at 6 mm depth, that is, the mean temperature exhibits a negligible fluctuation of 0.009 K when the channel depth is larger than 6 mm. Intriguingly, the delta between the maximum and minimum average temperatures is 0.08 K, implying a marginal effect of channel depths on the thermal management capacity of the cooling plate. Simultaneously, with an augmentation in channel depth, both the temperature variance and standard deviation of the battery show a gradual descent trend. At the depth of 6 mm, both metrics including temperature variance and standard deviation tend to stabilize, indicating that an augmentation in channel depth improves the temperature uniformity.
The heat exchange performances for the cooling plate with various channel depths are shown in Fig. 14. In Table 10, specific values of cold plate performance at different topological channel depths are listed. It is evident that, with the increase of channel depth, the pumping power experiences a significant reduction, with the maximum reduction of 84 %. This is attributed to the decrease of flow rate due to the increasing cross-sectional area of the channels as the depth of the channel increases, resulting in an overall decrease in channel pressure. Consequently, this results in the reduction of pressure drop at the inlet and outlet, signifying that the growth of channel depth can markedly reduce the pumping power. Correspondingly, the heat transfer coefficient of the cold plate decreases proportionally with the increase in depth This indicates that the reduction of the pumping power cost makes the decrease of the heat transfer ability of cold plates. The diminished pressure drop reduces the force of fluid scouring the boundary layer near the wall, resulting in a decline of heat transfer capacity of the cold plate. Considering that reducing the pressure can conserve energy consumption, the overall capability of the cooling plate is quantified using the 
 factor. It is noteworthy that the 
 factor peaks at 5 mm, however, increasing the depth value results in a reduction of this factor, leading to an increase of the average temperature of the battery. Therefore, a topology cold plate with the depth of 5 mm emerges as a particularly favorable choice.

4.6.3. The impact of different import flow rates
Investigating the impact of different flow rates on the performance of the cooling plate is crucial for identifying the flow rates, which is harmonize optimally with the design of cooling plate. The heat transfer performance of the cooling plate is studied with volume flow rates ranging from 0.06 L/min to 0.27 L/min, at the discharge rate of 3C for a battery and an initial ambient temperature of 298.15℃. From Fig. 15, it can be observed that with the increase of inlet volumetric flow rate, both the average surface temperature and temperature difference of the battery decrease. The difference between the lowest and highest average temperatures is 0.607 K, which is quite noticeable. Additionally, the subsequent temperature deviations decrease with the increase of inlet flow rate. This indicates that increasing the inlet flow rate compresses the fluid boundary layer, reducing the overall temperature of the battery and improving the temperature uniformity.

Fig. 15. Battery temperature change curve for different volume flow rate.

Fig. 16 shows the relationship between the flow rate and characteristics of the cold plate. In ascending flow rates, the power consumption of the hydraulic pump is in a surge due to the pressure drop experiencing a gradual upswing. Simultaneously, the heat transfer coefficient undergoes a continuous augmentation with a relatively modest variation. Consequently, the deduction can be made that elevating the inlet flow rate can augment heat transfer performance, yet the increase in heat transfer capacity is marginal. However, this approach leads to heightened pressure drop losses, consequently driving up operational costs. This phenomenon can be perceptible in the escalating friction factor (ƒ) and the sustained decline of the 
 ratio. Table 11 presents the specific performance values of the cold plate. The power consumption of the cold plate exhibits an increase of 82.12 % as the inlet flow rate increases. The comprehensive evaluation of the flow and thermal performance of cooling plate employs the factor η, while a higher value denotes a superior equilibrium between heat transfer and pressure drop losses. With the amplification of the flow rate, the evaluation factor of the cooling plate diminishes by approximately 95.03 %, signifying that the augment of pressure drop is larger than the increase of heat transfer capacity. Therefore, in practical scenarios, the decision to increase flow rates for temperature reduction must be carefully considered, while weighing the benefits against the augmented power consumption.

5. Experimental procedure
Due to the processing cost of the cold plate, we only adopted one type of cold plate as a test sample in the experiments. To verify the accuracy of the simulation results, the optimal model (NTM2) is fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques for subsequent work.

The cold plate uses a 20Ah lithium iron phosphate battery as the heat source. Thermally conductive adhesive is employed to bond the cold plate to the heat source, thereby reducing the contact thermal resistance.
5.1.2. Construction of experimental platform
The experimental platform system is represented in Fig. 18. Fig. 18 (a) presents a schematic diagram of the experiment, which shows the specific details of the test platform. A reliable constant-temperature water bath (BAIHUI-HH420) ensures the fluid temperatures at the inlets keeping constant with the value of 298.15 K. A peristaltic pump (MASTERFLEX GY7792175) is used to provide a constant temperature of the working fluid. The battery integrated detector precisely controls the discharge rate, maintaining a steady discharge current. Additionally, a digital pressure gauge (Commak C9551, 2.1 bar) records the pressure drop at the inlet and outlet. Data recording is initiated when the data becoming stable, ensuring the reliability of results with minimal fluctuations. The specific diagram of the experimental platform is shown in Fig. 18 (b).

5.2.2. Analysis of results
A comparison of simulated and experimental data for the cooling plate at different flow rates is given in Table 13, with channel depth of 5 mm and the volumetric flow rates ranging from 0.54 to 1.62 L/min. Larger flow rate is utilized in the experimental process for comparison and verification due to the limitation of experimental equipment in our lab. As the flow rate rises, the friction factor of the test set increases while η gradually decreases. It is noteworthy that the errors of both the friction factor and the cooling performance factor are within 15 %, which indicates that the simulated and experimental data are in good agreement.

6. Conclusions
This study introduces a novel topology optimization design method with a non-uniform heat source, aiming to create a topology cold plate which can efficiently dissipate the actual heat of the battery. Then, the non-uniform heat is calculated by Newman, Tiedemann, Gu, and Kim model. The topology optimization is carried out with the non-uniform heat source. Subsequently, the two-dimensional optimal results are stretched to generate three-dimensional numerical models, and the flow and thermal performances for these cooling plates are studied. Finally, the effects of channel depth and volume flow rate on the thermal performance of cold plates are further investigated. The main conclusions are as follows:

6.1. Limitations and future works
It is evident that the thermal performance of the cooling plate designed with topology optimization utilizing a non-uniform heat sources is superior to that of the cooling plate obtained by conventional topology optimization. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the methodology employed. Firstly, it should be noted that the temperature at the surface of the battery is taken into account, while the overall temperature of the battery is not considered. Secondly, the surface temperature of the battery is a dynamic during the discharge process. In view of the above constraints, we will conduct an intensive exploration of the discharging process of the battery in the future, and seek the optimal design to further improve the flow and thermal performances of cold plates.
