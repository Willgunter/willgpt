1. Introduction
Statistics project that global CO2 emissions will continue rising in 2025, albeit at a slower rate than in 2024. The global rapid deployment of electric vehicle (EV) is a key driver of this deceleration [1]. While ongoing breakthroughs in the EV battery technology have significantly alleviated range anxiety, achieving comparable charging speeds now emerges as the primary technical bottleneck in new EV development worldwide [2]. Current trends indicate that direct current (DC) ultra-fast charging can drastically reduce charging times. However, the requisite high currents invariably produce substantial Joule heating within charging cables, causing rapid temperature spikes localized at the charging cable's interface. Exceeding the thermal tolerance limits of cable components raises significant safety concerns, including the risk of thermal runaway and fire [3,4]. Consequently, the effective thermal management of the charger's internal structure, supplemented by active cooling strategies, is critical for operational safety during high-current charging [5].
Current primary commercial thermal management solutions include air cooling [[6], [7], [8]], active liquid cooling [[9], [10], [11]], and phase-change heat transfer methods [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. Within the electric vehicle industry, liquid-cooled charging systems have emerged as the predominant focus for global automakers and charging infrastructure developers. Fig. 1 illustrates the core components of a representative DC electric vehicle (EV) liquid-cooled charging cable assembly, designed in compliance with GB/T 33594-2017 specifications. Concurrently, flow boiling heat transfer has garnered significant research attention due to its capacity to absorb substantial latent heat during phase change, delivering significantly higher heat transfer coefficients than conventional single-phase cooling [[16], [17], [18]]. Experimental studies have further validated the feasibility of implementing flow boiling for thermal management within charging cable systems [19].

To investigate the impacts of flow boiling on coolant heat transfer performance across various conditions, extensive research has been conducted in the literature. Luo et al. [20] experimentally examined critical heat flux (CHF) during saturated flow boiling of R245fa in horizontal copper tubes under hypergravity. Their results demonstrated that elevated gravity levels increased CHF and corresponding outlet vapor quality, consequently reduced the deviation between CHF and dryout heat flux. However, minimal CHF variations were observed across gravity levels at high inlet vapor quality or mass velocity. Lee et al. [21] investigated localized heat transfer during saturated flow boiling in vertical narrow microchannels. They reported that superhydrophilic surfaces enhanced heat transfer coefficients through uniform liquid film maintenance and prevention of local dryout. Candan et al. [22] evaluated aspect ratio effects on saturated flow boiling of deionized water in rectangular microchannels. Peak heat transfer coefficients occurred at an aspect ratio of 1, whereas minima were observed at 0.25. Additionally, pressure drop minimization occurred at extreme aspect ratios. Lee et al. [23] characterized subcooled flow boiling in microchannels with varying aspect ratios and hydraulic diameters using combined experimental and numerical approaches. For fixed geometries, both average heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop increased with aspect ratio. Optimal heat transfer performance occurred at an aspect ratio of 5. Reduced hydraulic diameters yielded higher heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop. The optimal hydraulic diameter for thermal performance was determined as 0.92 mm. Hu et al. [24] experimentally investigated a novel pin-ribbed microchannel with rigid tails using Novec649. They demonstrated that the vertical orientation significantly enhanced flow boiling performance. High-speed visualization revealed that the vertical placement promoted more efficient bubble detachment via shear-induced mechanisms, thereby confirming the efficacy of rigid tails in augmenting bubble dynamics and overall thermal performance for advanced two-phase micro-heat sinks. Wang et al. [25] compared the flow boiling performance of Novec649 in horizontal and vertical upward pin-finned channels. They reported that while the heat transfer coefficients were comparable between both orientations, the vertical configuration exhibited a lower pressure drop, which resulted in superior overall thermal-hydraulic performance. Through flow visualization, they identified four distinct flow patterns and observed that the pin-fin structure prevented heat transfer deterioration even at high heat fluxes in the annular flow regime. Furthermore, their study quantified bubble dynamics and noted that an increase in heat flux enlarged the bubble diameter and detachment frequency, whereas an increase in fluid velocity reduced the bubble diameter but enhanced detachment frequency.
While experimental methods provide quantitative flow boiling analyses, they lack detailed assessment of heat, velocity and multiphysics fields within the channel. Consequently, researchers increasingly employ numerical simulations to complement experimental studies, enabling multidimensional analysis of flow boiling phenomena. Chang et al. [26] performed three-dimensional transient simulations of R1234ze(E) flow boiling in horizontal tubes, examining two-phase flow patterns, phase distributions, and velocity fields across varying mass velocity, saturation pressure, and heat flux. Their analysis revealed that flow pattern changed with increasing of vapor quality and heat transfer coefficient increased with increasing mass velocity and decreased with increasing saturation pressure. Lee et al. [27] applied the volume of fluid (VOF) method to simulate R452b flow boiling in microchannels, validated results against experimental data with strong agreement. They demonstrated significant influence of mass velocity and heat flux on both heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. At high mass velocities, the heat transfer coefficient increased with vapor quality, whereas at low mass velocities, localized dryout reduced heat transfer coefficient. Osowade et al. [28] utilized the MIXTURE model for three-dimensional simulations of R134a flow boiling in horizontal smooth tubes of varying diameters. Their results indicated that mass velocity substantially influenced both heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop at elevated vapor qualities. While heat flux critically affected heat transfer coefficient, its impact on pressure drop was negligible.
It is emphasized that flow boiling heat transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics also exhibit significant dependence on channel geometry. Devahdhanush et al. [29] numerically simulated FC-72 two-phase flow boiling in micro- and macro-channels using the VOF method coupled with the Lee phase-change model [30]. Their results demonstrated that micro-channels substantially outperformed macro-channels in heat transfer performance, evidenced by higher heat transfer coefficients and lower wall temperatures, but incur larger pressure drops and greater susceptibility to two-phase blockage. Seo et al. [31] experimentally investigated convective boiling heat transfer in concentric and eccentric annuli formed by an unheated outer tube and a centrally positioned heating rod. Their study captured transient behaviors and instabilities in the liquid film adhering to the inner tube wall, confirming vapor superficial velocity as the dominant parameter governing liquid-film dynamics specifically base film thickness and interfacial wave amplitude. The heat transfer coefficient increased monotonically with liquid superficial velocity while decreasing with rising vapor superficial velocity. Notably, while existing literature predominantly focuses on fluid flow through circular or rectangular channels, concentric annular configurations have received comparatively far less research attention.
In this study, the VOF method coupled with phase-change model is employed to simulate saturated flow boiling phenomena in a concentric annular channel. Investigations are performed to systematically assess the influence of heat flux, mass velocity, saturation temperature, and annular gap size on the thermal-hydraulic performance and cable ampacity limits across various operational conditions. The impacts brought by these operating parameters on pressure drop are also evaluated to quantify associated pumping power requirements. As the cooling of ultra-fast EV charging cables is still relied on the single-phase cooling strategy at present, the results reported in this study can provide essential design guidelines for optimizing thermal management systems in ultra-fast EV charging cables, in particular to the local heat transfer performance and pressure drop from a numerical view, the purpose of which is to fill the gap between the two-phase cooling fundamental studies and ultra-fast EV charging applications.
2. Computational methodologies
2.1. Geometric model and meshing
To improve computational efficiency, the computational domain in this study encompasses solely the fluid region of the electric vehicle liquid-cooled charging cable. Thermal coupling at the solid-fluid interface is rigorously addressed through the carefully defined boundary conditions, specifically by imposing a constant heat flux at the inner wall boundary. The computational domain configuration is depicted in Fig. 2. The liquid-cooled channel is modeled as a concentric annular passage with flowing liquid. Liquid enters the domain through the inlet, absorbs heat from the heated inner wall, and subsequently exits through the outlet. This configuration facilitates heat dissipation from the cable core via the circulating working fluid flow.

Fig. 2. Schematic of annulus flow geometry and boundary conditions.

The concentric annular channel is characterized by an inner diameter Di = 6.68 mm, an outer diameter Do = 11.08 mm, and a length L = 100 mm. Structured hexahedral grids are employed, incorporating boundary-layer refinement near the heated wall to accurately resolve critical near-wall phenomena, including phase change and vapor embryo development.
Grid independence is confirmed by monitoring the mean wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient across successively refined meshes. For grid independence testing, intermediate mass velocity of G = 455.9 kg/(m2·s) and heat flux of q''s = 98.7 kW/m2 are applied as boundary conditions. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the solution becomes grid-independent at 2,700,000 grids, as further refinement results in insignificant changes in both the wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient. This mesh configuration is selected in the present study to provide peak accuracy with minimum computing time. As the present case corresponds to turbulent flow, the dimensionless wall distance y along the heated inner wall is also critically evaluated. The y+ is defined as:
(1)
where y, uτ, and v are absolute distance to wall, frictional velocity and kinetic viscosity of mixture, respectively. This parameter serves as a standard metric for assessing the adequacy of near-wall grid resolution for heat transfer and phase-change phenomena. While y exhibits local variations along the channel due to property variation and local phase change, Fig. 3(b) demonstrates that the selected mesh resolution shows y+ < 5 consistently over the entire heated length. This confirms that the near-wall region, particularly the viscous sublayer, is sufficiently resolved to capture the essential physics.

2.2. Governing equations and solving methods
Due to the presence of vapor-liquid two-phase flow during flow boiling in annular channels, an appropriate multiphase flow model is necessary. The VOF model is particularly advantageous for determining multiphase interfaces. Its basic principle is to track the vapor-liquid interface using the volume fraction of each phase in the grid and determine changes in the vapor-liquid two-phase flow in each grid [32].
In this study, the flow boiling phenomenon in the annular channel is simulated using the VOF model. The sum of volume fractions of liquid and vapor phases is equal to 1, as shown below:
(2)
where αl and αv are volume fractions of liquid and vapor phases, respectively.
In the VOF model, the liquid-vapor interface can be delineated by solving continuity equation for the volume fraction. This can be expressed as follows [33]:
(3)
(4)
where α, 
, and ṁ are volume fraction, velocity vector and mass source term, respectively. Subscripts l and v refer to liquid and vapor phases, respectively.
The momentum equation can be expressed as [33]:
(5)
where P is pressure and g is gravitational acceleration. ρ and μ are volume-averaged density and volume-averaged dynamic viscosity, respectively, given by the following equations:
(6)
(7)
In the momentum equation, the volumetric force F generated by surface tension is calculated using the CSF model proposed by Brackbill et al. [34], expressed as:
(8)
where σ is surface tension coefficient, which is defined as a function of local temperature, and κ is surface curvature calculated from localized gradient at the normal interface.
The energy equation is expressed as [33]:
(9)
where SE is source term, and λ is volume-averaged thermal conductivity, given by the following equation:
(10)
In the energy equation, the energy E is considered as a mass-averaged variable, which can be expressed as:
(11)
where El and Ev are energy for liquid and vapor phase, respectively, both of which are calculated based on specific heats.
In order to facilitate accurate computations of heat and mass transfer processes, it is imperative to employ a suitable phase change model. The most commonly utilized phase change model is the Lee model [30]. This model has the capability to simulate heat and mass transfer processes both at the phase interface and within the phases. In this study, the Lee model is employed to simulate the phase transport in flow boiling, as depicted in Eq. (12).
(12)
where the variables are defined as follows: ṁl-v is mass source term, r is mass transfer time relaxation parameter, a positive empirical coefficient that depends on the specific problem and is influenced by operating conditions, geometry, and even mesh size. In this study, the recommended value is 0.5 s−1 determined through a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, which can accurately capture the phase-change process without introducing numerical instabilities. T is cell average temperature and Tsat is fluid saturation temperature.
The source term in the energy equation is determined by:
(13)
where LH is latent heat of working fluid, and ṁl-v is mass source term defined in Eq. (12).
The Reynolds number is employed to characterize the flow regime, distinguishing between laminar and turbulent flow. It is defined as follows:
(14)
where ρl is liquid density, ul is liquid velocity, μl is dynamic viscosity, and L is characteristic length. Within the investigated range of mass velocity from 400 to 800 kg/m2s, the calculated Reynolds number varies between 2625 and 5250, which corresponds to a turbulent flow regime.
To accurately capture turbulence effects in flow boiling, the Shear-Stress Transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model with turbulence damping is adopted. This hybrid model integrates the k-ω formulation in the near-wall region and the k-ε model in the free-stream region through a blending function. The SST k-ω turbulence model demonstrates superior performance in predicting temperature gradients near the liquid-vapor interface, primarily due to its ability to account for turbulence damping at phase interfaces [35]. The employment of SST k-ω model in the near-wall region facilitates the consideration of low Reynolds number effects and shear flow diffusion, thereby encompassing the majority of physical phenomena observed in two-phase flows [36].
The pressure-velocity coupling scheme is efficiently resolved using the pressure-implicit with splitting of operators (PISO) algorithm, which is particularly advantageous for transient flow simulations due to its inherent stability and reduced computational effort per time step compared to other segregated methods. Gradients are computed employing the least squares cell-based method, while pressure values are discretized via the PRESTO! scheme. Convection terms for momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, specific dissipation rate, and energy are all discretized using a second-order upwind differencing scheme, providing a favorable balance between solution accuracy, boundedness, and computational efficiency for these transported quantities compared to first-order methods. The interface between vapor and liquid phases is precisely captured using the geo-reconstruct technique within the volume of fluid framework.
This study aims to examine the effects of heat flux, mass flux, saturation temperature and annular gap size on the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of HFE-7100 during flow boiling in an annular channel. Under steady-state flow boiling conditions, the simulation captured the average pressure at the annular interface at axial positions of Z = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm, along with the average wall temperature at the designated points of Z = 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 mm.
To measure the heat transfer performance of the system, the heat transfer coefficient h is obtained using the following equation.

in which heat flux q''s and saturation temperature Tsat are specified as input parameters, whereas the wall temperature Tw is extracted from the simulation.
2.3. Boundary and initial conditions
The modeling approach in this study necessitates acknowledgment of some simplifications. The exclusion of solid conductor physics requires approximating Joule heating via a constant heat flux boundary condition applied at the annular channel's inner wall to keep alignment with the benchmark experimental study in Ref. [19]. This thermal boundary condition is defined by Ref. [19]:
(16)
where the variables are defined as follows: q''s is heat flux, I is current through conductor, Ts is average temperature of conductor surface, D is diameter of conductor, σ20 is resistivity of conductor material at 293.15 K, and α is temperature coefficient. In this study, σ20 = 1.724 × 10−8 Ωm for the copper conductor, and α = 4.29 × 10−3 K-1.
A constant heat flux boundary condition is applied to the inner surface of the annular channel, while the outer surface is treated as adiabatic. This three-dimensional configuration incorporates gravity effects to capture buoyancy-driven phenomena. Velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are implemented, with non-slip conditions at all solid boundaries. Inlet temperature is specified as saturation temperature, and conjugate heat transfer is modeled at solid-fluid interfaces through coupled thermal boundary conditions.
A systematic parametric study examines combinations of heat flux, mass velocity, saturation temperature, and annular gap size. Table 1 details the simulated operating conditions. HFE-7100 is selected as the working fluid. On the one hand, it has exceptional dielectric strength, permitting direct copper conductor contact without electrical insulation. On the other hand, it is non-flammable, non-corrosive, and has excellent compatibility with polymers and metal materials commonly used in cable construction, which ensures the long-term reliability of the system. The physical properties of HFE-7100 at various temperatures are meticulously calibrated using polynomials, as illustrated in Table 2.

2.4. Model validation
Quantitative validation against experimental data conducted by Devahdhanush et al. [19] is presented in Fig. 4(a). Simulated temperatures exhibit excellent agreement with experiments across 30–120 kW/m2 heat fluxes and 365.2–546.9 kg/(m2·s) mass velocities, demonstrating a 0.24 % maximum deviation. Fig. 4(b) provides qualitative validation via flow regime comparison using experimental imagery from Jung et al. [37]. At q''s = 238.5 kW/m2 and G = 488.4 kg/(m2·s), both simulations and experiments exhibit bubbly flow regimes with good visual concordance. These validations confirm the model accuracy in simulating saturated flow boiling in this study.

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Bubble behavior in annular flow boiling
Fig. 5 depicts the flow boiling characteristics of HFE-7100 within the annular outlet region under different operational parameters. At a saturation temperature of Tsat = 338.5 K and heat flux q''s = 30 kW/m2, reducing the mass velocity to G = 400 kg/(m2·s) substantially prolongs liquid-phase residence time. This extended thermal exposure intensifies bubble nucleation and promotes coalescence, leading to large-scale vapor formations that critically constrain heat dissipation efficiency in annular geometries. Conversely, elevating mass velocity to G = 800 kg/(m2·s) suppresses bubble growth by shortening heating intervals and accelerating bubble detachment through enhanced convective transport, thereby mitigating vapor blockage risks inherent to confined channels. When examining heat flux effects at Tsat = 338.5 K and G = 600 kg/(m2·s), lower heat flux of q''s = 20 kW/m2 initiates discrete nucleation sites, with vapor structures exhibiting wall-adhering sliding prior to detachment. Increasing heat flux to q''s = 40 kW/m2 elevates active nucleation site density, intensifying bubble interactions and coalescence to form wall-constrained vapor masses that directly challenge thermal management stability. Comparative analysis of saturation temperatures at fixed G = 600 kg/(m2·s) and q''s = 40 kW/m2 reveals diminished nucleation density at lower saturation temperature, attributable to higher latent heat requirements and elevated surface tension. This thermodynamic regime prolongs bubble growth duration before detachment, resulting in significantly enlarged vapor volumes that demand strategic channel design to prevent flow instabilities.

3.2. Parametric effects on annular flow boiling performance
Fig. 6 illustrates the temporal evolution of boiling bubble dynamics within concentric annular channels under varying applied heat fluxes. The simulation conditions maintained a constant saturation temperature of Tsat = 338.5 K and a fixed mass velocity of G = 600 kg/(m2·s). At the initial time of t = 10 ms, the heated surface shows no detectable bubble nucleation activity under moderate heat fluxes of 20 and 40 kW/m2. A distinct contrast emerges at the elevated heat flux of 80 kW/m2, where results reveal the abrupt appearance of distinct nucleation sites across the heated surface. As the thermal exposure continues, bubble generation begins across all investigated heat flux levels. This nucleation process exhibits progressive intensification, manifested three key interconnected phenomena including an exponential increase in active nucleation site density, continuous radial expansion of individual bubbles, and accelerated bubble detachment frequencies from the heated surface. These dynamic behaviors demonstrate particularly significant amplification at the maximum applied heat flux of 80 kW/m2. By the time of t = 200 ms, the boiling system transitions to a steady-state operation characterized by fully stabilized bubble characteristics. This temporal progression pattern aligns closely with the flow regime results presented in section 3.1. The thermally-driven acceleration of nucleation significantly enhances interfacial energy transfer by substantially enlarging the available phase-change surface area.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations elucidate the three-dimensional velocity distribution within the annular channel's liquid phase, as visualized in Fig. 7. Results reveal that peak flow velocities consistently manifest within the central core region of the channel. Concurrently, marked velocity gradients develop in close proximity to both the inner and outer channel walls, a direct consequence of boundary layer formation under the prevailing flow conditions. Furthermore, significant flow maldistribution characterizes the outlet cross-section, primarily attributable to dynamic interactions between the continuous liquid phase and dispersed boiling bubbles. This non-uniformity is most evident in the upper channel region, where velocity magnitudes reach their maximum. The underlying physical mechanism driving this phenomenon involves the buoyant ascent of vapor bubbles, which substantially enhances localized momentum transfer within the upper fluid domain. These findings collectively underscore the essential and complex interdependence between the spatial distribution of vapor-liquid phases and the resultant hydrodynamic behavior governing annular flow regimes, a relationship critical for accurate system modeling and practical design optimization.

Fig. 8 illustrates heat flux effects on vapor fraction and velocity profiles. Fig. 8(a) shows a consistent trend where vapor volume fraction increases progressively along the axial direction as the applied heat flux rises and attains its maximum value at the channel outlet under all investigated conditions. Complementing this, Fig. 8(b) demonstrates that elevated turbulence intensity within vapor phase is identified as the primary driver for higher outlet velocities observed at increased heat flux levels. These simulation findings collectively confirm that higher heat fluxes significantly enhance thermal energy transport within the annular channel. This enhancement is principally achieved by generating vigorous bubble-induced secondary flows. However, results also indicate that excessive vapor accumulation associated with high heat fluxes may impede the development of uniform flow patterns, particularly in the downstream region, presenting a potential challenge for system stability.

Fig. 9 depicts pressure distributions obtained at multiple axial positions along the annular channel. Results reveal a continuous pressure decrease from inlet position at Z = 0 mm to outlet at Z = 100 mm, a primary consequence of frictional flow resistance encountered by the working fluid. Simultaneously, gravitational forces establish a consistent pressure differential across the channel height, resulting in higher simulated pressure values within the lower channel region compared to the upper section. Furthermore, the detailed pressure contours elucidate characteristics related to bubble distribution within the flow field. Specifically, the vapor phase interiors maintain elevated pressure relative to the surrounding liquid phase, thereby generating steep pressure gradients across the vapor-liquid interfaces. A notable observation occurs at the axial position Z = 50 mm, where the local pressure simulated under the high heat flux condition of 80 kW/m2 substantially exceeds the corresponding values obtained at 20 kW/m2. This significant pressure differential serves as a key indicator confirming the predominant influence exerted by the vapor phase on the overall pressure distribution characteristics within the annular channel.

Fig. 10 presents heat flux effects on axial pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient. Fig. 10(a) shows that the total pressure drop increases sharply with rising heat flux, with a particularly pronounced rise observed as the heat flux density increases from 40 kW/m2 to 80 kW/m2. This substantial increase in pressure drop necessitates greater pumping power and heightens the potential for flow instabilities within the system. Fig. 10(b) indicates that saturated inlet fluid undergoes immediate nucleate boiling upon contact with the heated wall. This rapid phase change mechanism maintains a remarkably uniform axial temperature distribution along the heated surfaces. The absence of a discernible thermal entrance effect is resulting from the immediate establishment of fully-developed nucleate boiling at the channel inlet, where efficient bubble activity from the onset supersedes the weaker single-phase convective flow typically observed in the non-boiling region. Consequently, consistent exterior temperatures on the cable core are ensured. Furthermore, higher heat fluxes lead to a significant enhancement in heat transfer coefficient. Specifically, increasing the heat flux from q''s = 20 kW/m2 to q''s = 80 kW/m2 elevates the heat transfer coefficient by 62.43 %. This trend is primarily governed by the intensification of nucleate boiling. Under elevated heat flux, the wall superheat increases, which activates more nucleation sites and significantly raises the bubble population density on the heating surface, as evidenced by the visual observations in Fig. 6. The ensuing growth and detachment of these bubbles effectively extract thermal energy from the heated wall via latent heat absorption during vaporization, thereby augmenting the overall heat transfer coefficient. This marked improvement substantially enhances the thermal dissipation capacity of the cable core.

Fig. 11 examines the influence of inlet mass velocity variations on outlet velocity distributions within the annular channel under constant heat flux of q''s = 30 kW/m2 and saturation temperature of Tsat = 338.5 K. Results reveal that outlet velocity distributions undergo pronounced modification through adjustment of the inlet mass velocity. At the lowest tested mass velocity of G = 400 kg/(m2·s), significant spatial velocity fluctuations are evident across the outlet cross-section. This observed trend aligns with the heat flux effects documented in Fig. 8, indicating that enhanced vapor generation occurring at reduced mass velocity amplifies flow instabilities and increases exit velocity non-uniformity. Conversely, increasing the mass velocity to G = 800 kg/(m2·s) markedly suppresses these spatial velocity variations. Under higher flow conditions, the outlet velocity profile becomes primarily governed by the inlet momentum. Bubble-induced flow disturbances are substantially diminished, leading to velocity distributions dominated by convective momentum transfer mechanisms.

Fig. 12 provides the effects of inlet mass velocity on vapor volume fraction and velocity distributions. Fig. 12(a) clearly shows a substantial reduction in axial vapor volume fraction as the mass velocity increases. This reduction signifies a fundamental shift in the dominant thermal transport mechanism. At low mass velocities, nucleate boiling emerges as the primary heat transfer mode. Conversely, forced convection becomes predominant at elevated mass velocities. Complementing this, Fig. 12(b) presents the corresponding modifications observed in the radial outlet velocity profiles. These profile changes are directly linked to the variations in vapor fraction documented in Fig. 12(a). The observed inverse relationship between mass velocity and vapor formation drives this fundamental transition in both heat transfer mechanisms and hydrodynamic behavior. Throughout the operational range examined, vapor-mediated momentum transfer diminishes progressively as the mass velocity intensifies.

Fig. 13 depicts axial pressure distributions obtained under different inlet mass velocities. At the lower mass velocity of G = 400 kg/(m2·s), the greater bubble population density and size correspond to generally reduced local pressure values compared to conditions at G = 800 kg/(m2·s). This finding diverges from the conclusions presented in Fig. 9 regarding heat flux dominance. Results highlight mass velocity as the pivotal governing parameter for pressure distribution regulation within the annular channel under the specific operational constraints investigated. Consequently, mass velocity exerts a predominant influence on overall system pressure behavior under these conditions.

Fig. 14 provides a quantitative summary of the effects of inlet mass velocity on both axial pressure drop and thermal performance metrics. Fig. 14(a) illustrates a consistent increase in total pressure drop with elevated mass velocity, a trend driven by the quadratic dependence of frictional pressure loss on mass velocity. Maintaining these higher flow conditions requires correspondingly higher inlet pressures, thereby imposing proportionally higher pumping power demands on the system. Complementing the pressure drop data, Fig. 14(b) demonstrates a significant enhancement in the average axial heat transfer coefficient. Specifically, increasing mass velocity from 400 to 800 kg/(m2·s) elevates this coefficient by 26.5 %. This improvement is physically explained by the intensification of convective heat transfer, where the higher mass velocity thins the thermal boundary layer, and the increased wall shear stress promotes efficient bubble detachment, refreshing active nucleation sites. This quantitative improvement confirms that heightened mass velocity substantially boosts thermal energy transfer efficiency at the critical interface between the cable core and the working fluid. Consequently, the modulation of mass velocity emerges as a pivotal operational parameter for optimizing the overall thermal-hydraulic performance within annular flow boiling systems.

Previous analyses have established the significant influence of operational conditions on flow boiling phenomena. While elevated heat fluxes and mass velocities enhance thermal transport capacity, they simultaneously impose higher pumping power demands on the system. Variations in system operating pressure correspondingly alter the working fluid saturation temperatures and associated thermophysical properties, including surface tension and latent heat. These property variations fundamentally modify the underlying boiling processes. Fig. 15 illustrates the effects of saturation temperature on outlet velocity distributions within annular channels under fixed operating conditions, specifically a mass velocity of G = 600 kg/(m2·s) and a heat flux of q''s = 40 kW/m2. Similar to the impacts of heat flux and mass velocity, phase change driven by saturation temperature variations generates non-uniform radial velocity fluctuations. This occurs through localized bubble formation and subsequent migration governed by density-driven buoyancy effects. Critically, lower saturation temperatures, such as Tsat = 326.8 K, exhibit substantially higher velocity peak magnitudes compared to elevated saturation temperature of Tsat = 338.5 K. This characteristic velocity differential trend receives quantitative confirmation through the comparative analysis presented in Fig. 16 (b).

Fig. 16(a) and (b) respectively illustrate the influence of saturation temperature on axial vapor fraction distributions and radial outlet velocity profiles within the annular channel. Reduced saturation temperatures induce a significant increase in vapor volume fraction accompanied by elevated flow velocities. This vapor fraction augmentation originates from enhanced working fluid surface tension at lower saturation temperatures, which thermodynamically promotes larger bubble departure sizes during detachment. Spatial regions exhibiting higher vapor fractions correlate directly with intensified local flow acceleration. Consequently, systems operating at diminished saturation temperatures demonstrate quantifiably higher overall exit velocities. Results provide quantitative validation for the flow patterns visualized in the velocity contours of Fig. 15. Collectively, they establish a rigorous causal interdependence between thermal operating conditions and resultant hydrodynamic behavior in annular flow boiling systems.
Fig. 17 quantitatively characterizes saturation temperature effects on axial heat transfer coefficients and pressure gradients within the annular channel. Fig. 17(a) demonstrates a systematic increase in heat transfer coefficients with decreasing saturation temperatures. At Tsat = 326.8 K, the coefficient exhibits a 13.86 % enhancement relative to operation at Tsat = 338.5 K. This thermal performance improvement originates from the combined effects of thermophysical property variations and enhanced bubble dynamics under reduced saturation temperatures. While the elevated latent heat of vaporization optimizes enthalpy utilization per unit mass, the concurrent changes in phase densities and surface tension significantly intensify nucleation activity and bubble detachment frequency, further augmenting phase-change heat absorption efficiency. Simultaneously, Fig. 17(b) reveals progressively diminishing pressure gradients with rising saturation temperatures. This reduction arises due to elevated saturation temperatures decreasing liquid-phase density and dynamic viscosity while increasing corresponding vapor-phase properties. These thermophysical property variations reduce interfacial density contrasts and viscous shear stresses, substantially suppressing turbulent dissipation rates throughout the flow domain. Consequently, momentum transfer resistance decreases significantly under higher saturation temperature conditions.

Fig. 18 compares outlet velocity distributions under identical operating conditions for two distinct gap configurations. Relative to the δ = 2.2 mm gap size, the constrained δ = 1.1 mm channel exhibits significantly enhanced velocity symmetry between upper and lower channel regions. This flow symmetry is attributed to reduced gravitational effects within the geometrically confined passage. Conversely, the narrower gap configuration demonstrates more pronounced local flow instabilities resulting from intensified bubble nucleation density in spatially restricted domains. Collectively, these observations reveal how geometric confinement fundamentally restructures phase-change hydrodynamics through competing phenomena of gravitational suppression versus vapor generation intensification, critically governing thermal transport efficiency in annular flow systems.

Fig. 19(a) and (b) respectively characterize the effects of annular gap sizes on axial vapor fraction distributions and radial outlet velocity profiles. Reduced channel gaps significantly elevate both global vapor holdups and local vapor concentrations. This amplification mechanism arises from geometric confinement imposing anisotropic growth constraints on developing vapor phases. Spatial restrictions inhibit radial bubble expansion while intensifying capillary forces, thereby promoting bubble collision-coalescence events prior to wall detachment. This modified nucleation dynamics generates larger vapor clusters with increased residence times, consequently enhancing overall vapor presence. Fig. 19(b) further corroborates this confinement effect, demonstrating systematically elevated radial velocity magnitudes at the outlet of narrow-gap channels relative to larger-gap configurations. The accelerated flow profiles directly manifest enhanced vapor-driven momentum transfer within spatially constrained boiling regimes, where vapor-liquid interfacial interactions dominate energy conversion processes.

Fig. 20 presents pressure contour distributions across axial positions in annular channels with differing gap sizes. Thermodynamic comparisons reveal significantly lower pressure magnitudes throughout the δ = 2.2 mm channel relative to its δ = 1.1 mm counterpart under equivalent mass velocity conditions. Contour analysis further indicates that larger-gap configurations contain attenuated vapor structures characterized by smaller individual volumes and reduced spatial density. Conversely, reduced-gap geometries exhibit enhanced vapor presence featuring expanded agglomerates with greater fractional occupancy. These geometric dependencies align directly with vapor fraction measurements in Fig. 19(a), confirming that annular confinement intensifies both vapor generation kinetics and interfacial pressure interactions through capillary confinement effects. The established inverse correlation between gap dimension and system pressure magnitude identifies geometric scaling as a critical design parameter governing hydraulic performance in compact flow boiling systems.

Fig. 21 quantifies the effects brought by annular gap size on axial pressure distributions and heat transfer coefficients. Fig. 21(a) reveals substantially elevated total pressure drop with reduced gap sizes. Diminished hydraulic diameter increases frictional resistance while geometric confinement intensifies vapor-phase obstruction through enhanced bubble-wall interactions. Concurrently, Fig. 21(b) demonstrates systematically enhanced heat transfer coefficients with decreasing gap size. The δ = 1.1 mm configuration achieves an 11.03 % higher average heat transfer coefficient relative to the δ = 2.2 mm configuration. This thermal enhancement primarily originates from intensified wall shear stress within narrow gaps, where elevated shear forces accelerate bubble detachment kinetics. Reduced vapor residence times consequently enhance near-wall microconvection and turbulent dissipation, significantly improving thermal energy transfer from heated surfaces to the working fluid.

3.3. Cable current limit under safety thresholds
In compliance with National Standard of China GB/T 33594-2017, the maximum permissible operating temperature for charging cable cores is 363.15 K, constituting a critical safety threshold for operational integrity. Fig. 22 presents simulated profiles of mean cable core surface temperature as a function of mass velocity across varying electrical currents, with heat flux density converted to equivalent current values through Eq. (16). Consistent with established thermal principles, the core temperature demonstrates pronounced elevation with increasing current intensity, whereas augmented mass velocity induces substantial cooling effects. Under the operating conditions of G = 400 kg/(m2·s), Tsat = 338.5 K and δ = 1.1 mm, the maximum sustainable current reaches 1160 A, corresponding to a peak mean core surface temperature of 360.4 K, which remains safely below the regulatory limit. At 1160 A, increasing mass velocity from G = 400 kg/(m2·s) to 600 kg/(m2·s) achieves a 1.36 % core temperature decrease. Further escalation to 800 kg/(m2·s) however yields only 0.25 % additional cooling, reflecting efficacy attenuation. This evidence substantiates that under high-current conditions, singular reliance on the coolant flow rate elevation manifests fundamentally constrained cooling efficiency due to the onset of thermal-hydraulic saturation effects.

4. Conclusions
This study systematically investigates the cooling strategy of annular flow boiling in thermal management of ultra-fast electric vehicle charging cables, focusing on the synergistic effects of heat flux, mass velocity, saturation temperature and annular gap size. Following conclusions are summarized.
(1)
Under different operating conditions, the nucleation and growth of bubbles are synergistically co-regulated by multiple parameters. Increasing heat flux from 40 to 80 kW/m2 enhances bubble nucleation density and fluid turbulence, elevating the heat transfer coefficient by 62.43 %. However, once heat flux exceeds 40 kW/m2, the pressure drop increases exponentially, consequently raising pump power requirements and reducing liquid cooling system stability. Elevating mass velocity shifts the dominant heat transfer mechanism from nucleate boiling to convective heat transfer. When mass velocity rises from 400 to 800 kg/(m2·s), the average heat transfer coefficient improves by 26.51 %. Conversely, solely increasing mass velocity causes a gradual deceleration in temperature reduction under high operational conditions. Specifically, when mass velocity is increased from 600 to 800 kg/(m2·s), the temperature reduction rate of the cable core significantly diminishes to less than 0.25 %.
(2)
The gap size of channel and the saturated temperature of fluid significantly impact bubble behavior and the performance of liquid cooling systems. Reducing the gap size increases wall shear stress, promoting bubble detachment and resulting in an 11.03 % increase in the heat transfer coefficient for a reduced-gap channel (δ = 1.1 mm) compared to a larger-gap channel (δ = 2.2 mm). However, the reduced flow channel causes a significant increase in pressure drop due to the reduced hydraulic diameter and exacerbates the risk of blockage of the flow channel caused by bubble coalescence. Reducing the saturation temperature from 338.5 K to 326.8 K enhances latent heat utilization and bubble volume fraction, thereby increasing the heat transfer coefficient by 13.86 %. This improvement is nevertheless accompanied by an increased pressure drop.
(3)
For high-power charging cables in electric vehicles, using flowing boiling as a thermal management solution requires a strategy that optimizes multiple parameters rather than adjusting a single parameter. Within the scope of this study, with operating conditions of G = 400 kg/(m2·s), Tsat = 338.5 K and δ = 1.1 mm, the cable can carry a maximum current of 1160 A. At this point, the average surface temperature of cable core is below the safety threshold.
It is emphasized that the operational parameter ranges in this study, encompassing heat fluxes from 20 to 80 kW/m2, mass velocities from 400 to 800 kg/(m2·s), saturation temperatures from 326.8 to 338.5 K, and annular gap sizes from 1.1 to 2.2 mm, are carefully selected to reflect the practical thermal hydraulic demands of ultra-fast electric vehicle charging cables while ensuring system safety and structural feasibility. Although the quantitative results are bound to this specific range, the fundamental physical mechanisms elucidated herein, particularly the intensification of nucleate boiling with increasing heat flux, the progressive dominance of convective heat transfer at higher mass velocities, and the critical influence of gap size on bubble dynamics and flow resistance, possess broad applicability to annular flow boiling systems in general.
