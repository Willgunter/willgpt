Abstract
The precipitate phases of an 11Cr F/M steel in normalized-and-tempered state and after irradiation with 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ions at 700 °C to 0.84 dpa were studied using transmission electron microscopy. Cr-rich precipitate phase underwent great changes under irradiation. While the existing Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.8 remained, Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.0 were precipitated during irradiation. Irradiation induced the precipitation of rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within martensite laths, and Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a parallelogram morphology in the matrix. Irradiation-induced Cr-rich M2X (Cr2N type) carbonitride and Cr-rich M7C3 carbide were identified. Irradiation significantly affected δ-ferrite in the steel, resulting in the precipitation of dense and small Cr-rich M3X2 carbonitrides based on Cr3C2 within δ-ferrite grains. Irradiation caused significant changes in the nature of Nb-rich precipitate phases. While the existing Nb-Ta-rich MX carbonitrides based on NbC (fcc lattice, a = 0.4469 nm) remained under irradiation, irradiation induced three types of Nb-rich phases, including Nb-Ta-rich MX carbonitride based on NbC (fcc lattice, a = 1.115 nm), Nb2C (simple orthorhombic lattice) carbide, and Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 carbonitride based on Nb6C5 (base-centered monoclinic lattice). Irradiation also induced the formation of two types of intermetallic compound phases, σ-FeCrW (base-centered tetragonal lattice) and Fe-Cr (bcc lattice) which are absent in the normalized-and-tempered steel, within the δ-ferrite adjacent to δ-ferrite-martensite boundaries. The formation of the irradiation-induced precipitate phases is also discussed.

Introduction
Ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels (9–12 % Cr) are promising candidate materials for sodium or lead cooled fast reactors with a high temperature [<875 K (600 °C)] and compact primary system, as well as for the pressure vessel of high temperature gas-cooled fast reactors [1]. When high-Cr (9–12 %) F/M steels are used in the fuel cladding of the fast reactors, they will face serious challenges because the service temperature of the fuel cladding in fast reactors is expected to approach 650–700 °C, and the maximum service temperature of existing high-Cr F/M steels is limited to only about 620 °C [2]. To satisfy high Cr F/M steels for applications in the fuel cladding of the fast reactors, 9–12Cr F/M steels with service temperatures up to 650 °C and higher require development, and at the same time, research on the effects of irradiation on the microstructure and properties of both existing and newly developed 9–12Cr F/M steels also needs to be conducted.
9 − 12Cr F/M steels with lower carbon (0.1 wt% max) contents and additions of Mo, W, V, Nb, N and other elements possess higher creep-rupture strengths combined with good oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures [3]. As precipitation hardening is one of the strengthening mechanisms of 9 − 12Cr F/M steels, the steels usually contain several types of precipitate phases, including M23C6, M6C, M7C3, MX and M2X carbides/carbonitrides, where M denotes a metallic element, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen atoms, and Fe2(Mo,W) Laves and Fe7W6 intermetallic compounds, in matrix and grain boundaries [4] produced by some processes such as heat treatments. The influence extent of precipitate phases on the high-temperature creep properties of high-Cr F/M steels mainly depends on their nature (type), thermal stability, size and distribution. The secondary precipitate phases formed in the matrix during tempering will determine the properties of steels [5], whereas, intermetallic compounds formed during creep or heat treatment will have a negative effect on the properties of steels. For instance, M2X and secondary MX phases as small precipitates uniformly distributed in the matrix contribute the creep strength of steels by acting as obstacles to dislocation motion at high temperatures [6], fine MX [(V(C,N) and/or Nb(C,N)] precipitates which are resistant to coarsening enhance the high temperature strength/creep resistance of high Cr F/M steels, and the precipitation of M6X and Fe2(W,Mo) Laves phases during creep causes a loss of long term creep strength of high Cr F/M steels [7], [8], [9], [10]. Since precipitate phases can significantly affect the high-temperature creep properties of high-Cr F/M steels, studies on the precipitate phases of the steels are important for understanding the creep properties of the steels [11].
Irradiation can cause a series of changes in the precipitate phases of high-Cr F/M steels, such as the coarsening and/or partial dissolution and modification of the composition of M23C6 precipitates, partial or complete dissolution of M2X and MX phases, and irradiation-induced formation of new, non-equilibrium precipitate phases [3]. These changes will undoubtedly affect the high-temperature service performance of the steels used in the fuel cladding of the fast reactors. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out in-depth and detailed research on the characteristics and evolution behavior of precipitate phases in high-Cr F/M steels under irradiation.
So far, there have been many reports on the changes of precipitate phases in high-Cr F/M steels under irradiation. These reports can be primarily categorized into four types. The first type elucidates whether the precipitate phases are dissolved during irradiation. For instance, neutron irradiation caused the dissolution of M23C6 precipitates in 9Cr F/M steels, but the microstructure of 12Cr F/M steels generally remained stable under the irradiation [12]. Neutron irradiation caused minor changes in Nb-enriched MC carbides of 9Cr-lMoVNb steel [13], whereas, neutron irradiation caused the complete dissolution of Nb-rich MC precipitates in 10Cr-2Mo steel [14]. The dissolution of Cr-rich M2X precipitates was reported to occur in HT-9 steel under nickel ion irradiation [15] and in TMT (thermomechanical treatment)-strengthened P92 steel under Fe ion irradiation [16]. The second type determines the size stability of precipitate phases during irradiation. For example, there was little or no change in the size of M23C6 and MX precipitates in HT-9 steel after nickel ion irradiation [15], and M23C6 precipitates in 9Cr-1MoVNb steel after neutron irradiation [13], whereas, neutron irradiation caused the coarsening of precipitates in Fe-9Cr alloys [17] and 11Cr F/M steel [18], and Fe ion irradiation also resulted in the coarsening of M23C6 precipitates in TMT-strengthened P92 steel [16]. The third type describes whether the chemical composition of precipitate phases changes during irradiation. It was reported that there was no change in the composition of M23C6 precipitates in high-Cr F/M steels after high-energy Ni ion [15], neutron [12], [19] and Fe ion [16] irradiation. On the contrary, there was a decrease in Cr/Fe ratio and an increase in the Mo/Fe and Mo/Cr ratios in M23C6 precipitates in T91 steel after proton irradiation [20]. The fourth type involves irradiation-induced phases. Klueh and Harries [3] summarized irradiation-induced phases in high-Cr F/M steels, including Cr-rich ferrite (α′), M6X (η), Chi (χ), G-phase, Laves phase (Fe2W type) and sigma (σ) phase. Irradiation-induced M2X precipitate phase was also reported to be present in 9Cr and 12Cr F/M steels [12]. Recently, irradiation-induced phases, including Cr- and V-rich M2X, Fe71Cr26(Mo,W)3 (σ-FeCr type), Nb6C5/Nb-rich M6C5, Nb-rich MX(NbN type), Fe-rich M3C and M2C, Cr-rich M2N0.39C0.61 and Laves phase (Fe2Nb type), were reported to be present in tempered and TMT-strengthened P92 steel after Fe ion irradiation at different temperatures [21], [22], [23]. From previous reports, many results are inconsistent or even contradictory, and there is no consensus. The nature and magnitude of irradiation-induced changes depend on the steel composition and structure and irradiation temperature and displacement doses [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to study the changes of precipitate phases in different candidate F/M steels under different irradiation conditions.
High-Cr F/M steel SAVE12 with an expected maximum use temperature of 650 °C was laboratory developed in Japan [24], [25], [26]. By referring to the nominal chemical composition of the SAVE12 steel [24], we prepared an 11Cr F/M steel with a chemical composition close to that of the SAVE 12. The prepared steel with the normalized and tempered condition was proved to contain several types of precipitate phases, involving Cr-rich M23C6, Nb-rich MC/MX, Fe-rich M5C2 and sigma phases [27]. In this study, the prepared 11Cr F/M steel was used to examine the change of precipitate phases under Fe ion irradiation. Considering the maximum service temperatures of the fuel cladding in fast reactors mentioned above, an irradiation temperature of 700 °C was selected during irradiation experiment. The irradiation damage of the microstructure of fuel cladding under irradiation is a process of accumulation, that is, the damage gradually changes from zero to small and then to large. To evaluate the application of candidate materials in the nuclear reactors, it is necessary to study the microstructure and properties of the candidate materials under irradiation at various temperatures and damage doses. In this work, the change of precipitate phases was preliminarily examined under Fe ion irradiation at 700 °C and a low irradiation dose, which can provide reference for subsequent studies under irradiation at different temperatures and higher doses.
Experimental procedures
The initial experimental material used in this study was the 11Cr F/M steel in the form of a 100 kg ingot, which was prepared through vacuum induction melting and casting. The chemical composition of the steel is given in Table 1. The ingot was subjected to a homogenization at 1180 °C for 3 h, and then a hot-rolling in the temperature range of 940 to 1050 °C into a 30 mm thick steel plate. Rectangular steel bar with a dimension of 200 mm × 30 mm × 30 mm was cut from the plate with the long axis along the rolling direction. The bar was subjected to a final heat treatment consisting of a normalization followed by a tempering. The normalization and tempering were conducted at 1050 °C for 0.5 h and at 780 °C for 1.5 h, respectively. During the normalization and tempering, the bar was finally cooled in air to room temperature.

Sheet samples with a dimension of 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm were cut from heat treated bar by spark erosion. The sheet samples were ground down to about 80 μm thick using sandpaper, then punched into disks with a diameter of 3 mm. Thin foil specimens were prepared from the disks by twin-jet electropolishing in a solution of 5 % perchloric acid in ethyl alcohol at − 25 °C at 45 V.
Some of the thin foil specimens were irradiated with 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ions at the 320 kV platforms for multi-discipline research with highly charged ions at the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Irradiation temperature was 700 °C, fluctuating by ± 10 °C. Thermocouple wire positioned in the sample zone of irradiation chamber was used to measure and control the irradiation temperature in real time by a PID controller. The time duration of the irradiation process was 2 h. During the irradiation process, ion-beam intensity recorded on an Agilent 34410A 61/2 Digit Multimeter varied from 1.59 × 10−6 to 1.83 × 10−6 A with an average of 1.72 × 10−6 A. From the average beam intensity, irradiation area and the valence state of Fe ions, the irradiation time for producing a displacement damage of 1dpa was calculated to be 2.39 h, and hence the average displacement damage dose of the whole specimen thickness after the irradiation for 2 h was estimated to be 0.84 dpa. Ion fluence was 2.818 × 1015 ions/cm2, and ion flux was 3.914 × 1011 ions/cm2s for thin foil specimens. Depth profiles of displacement damage and iron ion concentration in the irradiated samples were calculated by SRIM 2013 software and shown in Fig. 1. The calculation was performed by selecting ion distribution and quick calculation of damage options, Fe ions at 3.5 MeV, ion fluence of 2.818 × 1015 ions/cm2, and the alloy element content and density (7.9 g/cm3) of the steel. The displacement threshold energy for each alloy element was selected according to ASTM E531-96. No random number seed was specified. During the irradiation process, the level of vacuum in the irradiation chamber was maintained at 10−4–10−5 Pa.

The unirradiated and irradiated thin foil specimens were examined on FEI TECNAI G2S-TWIN transmission electron microscopes (TEM) operating at 200 kV. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer equipped on the TEM was used for the determination of precipitate composition. The qualitative analysis of precipitate phases in the thin foil specimens was carried out by EDX data, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in combination with the Powder Diffraction File database of the Joint Commission Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS).
Results
Cr-rich precipitates
Fig. 2(a–g) are a group of TEM micrographs of unirradiated thin foils. Fig. 2(a, b) show tempered martensite with precipitates and dislocations. Most precipitates are distributed along the boundary of martensite laths, while a few fine precipitates are distributed within the laths. Fig. 2(c–g) show five precipitates marked P1–P5 with arrows. The chemical composition of the five precipitates was EDX analyzed and the composition of the metal fraction in the precipitates was determined to be approximately 55Cr-30Fe-10 W-5Nd (at.%), as given in Table 2. SAED pattern recorded from precipitate P5, as presented in Fig. 2(h), is accordant with the electron diffraction (ED) pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35-0783, face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) lattice with lattice parameter a = 1.06599 nm) phase in the zone axis of [1 1 1]. Thereby precipitate P5 was identified as Cr-rich M23C6 phase with an fcc crystal structure. Precipitates P1-P4 were also identified as the Cr-rich M23C6 phase.

The composition of the metal fraction in 13 identified Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates in unirradiated thin foils was analyzed as approximately 53-65Cr, 25-37Fe, 6–10 W, 0-9Nd, and averaged to be approximately 57Cr-31Fe-8 W-4Nd (at.%). This indicates that the concentration ratio of Cr and Fe in the Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates of the tempered 11Cr steel is approximately Cr/Fe = 1.84.
Fig. 3(a–h) are a group of TEM micrographs of the irradiated thin foils. Fig. 3(a, b) show that in addition to many precipitates distributed at martensite lath boundaries and fine precipitates within the laths, there are also many larger rod-like precipitates within the laths. In the tempered 11Cr steel, such rod-like precipitates do not occur within the martensite laths, so these precipitates are irradiation-induced precipitates.

Fig. 3. TEM micrographs taken from the irradiated thin foils of 11Cr F/M steel, showing (a) and (b) martensite with larger rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within laths, (c) arrow-marked Cr-rich M23C6 precipitate P6 with a Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.8, (d) and (e) arrow-marked Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates P7-P9 with a Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.0, (f) irradiation-induced rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates including precipitate P10 within laths, (g) and (h) irradiation-induced parallelogram-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates marked with arrows including precipitate P11. (i)–(l) SAED patterns from precipitates P6, P9, P10 and P11 indexed in terms of the EDPs of Cr23C6 in the four zone axes of [1 1 1], [1 1 2], [0 1 1] and [0 1 1], respectively.

Fig. 3(c) shows precipitate P6 marked with arrow. This precipitate has a metallic element composition of approximately 55Cr-25Fe-7 W-8Nd (at.%) along with a few other elements, as given in Table 2. SAED pattern recorded from precipitate P6, as shown in Fig. 3(i), is accordant with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35-0783) in the zone axis of [111]. So, precipitate P6 was identified as Cr-rich M23C6 phase. The composition of the metal fraction in 19 identified Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates in the irradiated thin foils was determined as approximately 35-64Cr, 25-56Fe, 5–14 W, 0-8Nd, 0-4Mn, and averaged to be approximately 54Cr-31Fe-8 W-5Nd-2Mn (at.%), revealing a Cr/Fe ratio of 1.74 similar with the ratio in the tempered steel. This indicates that the present irradiation has no obvious effect on the composition of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates in the 11Cr steel.
Fig. 3(d,e) show three arrow-marked precipitates P7-P9. These three precipitates have a metallic element composition of approximately 43Cr-40Fe-6 W-6Nd (at.%) along with a few other elements, as given in Table 2. SAED pattern in Fig. 3(j) was taken from precipitate P9. This pattern is accordant with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783) in the zone axis of [1 1 2]. Precipitates P7-P9 were also identified to be Cr-rich M23C6 phase with an fcc crystal structure.
The composition of the metal fraction in 5 identified Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with this similar composition in the irradiated thin foils was approximately 40-49Cr, 39-44Fe, 4–7 W, 0-7Nd, and averaged to be approximately 44Cr-41Fe-6 W-5Nd (at.%) along with a few other elements. The concentration ratio of Cr and Fe in this type of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitate is approximately Cr/Fe = 1.07. This type of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitate was not observed in the tempered 11Cr steel, which is likely to be an irradiation-induced Cr-rich M23C6 phase.
Fig. 3(f) shows several rod-like precipitates distributed in the martensite lath. As mentioned above, these rod-like precipitates within martensite laths are irradiation-induced phase. EDX analysis of rod-like precipitate P10 marked with arrow, as shown in Table 2, reveals that the precipitate is Cr-rich phase. SAED pattern in Fig. 3(k) was taken from precipitate P10. This pattern is accordant with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783) in the zone axis of [0 1 1]. Precipitate P10 was also determined as Cr-rich M23C6 phase with an fcc crystal structure. Therefore, the present irradiation induced the precipitation of rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within martensite laths.
Fig. 3(g,h) show parallelogram-like precipitates marked with arrows. There is no precipitate phase with such morphology in the tempered 11Cr steel. EDX results of parallelogram-like precipitate P11 in Fig. 3(h) indicate that the precipitate is Cr-rich phase, as shown in Table 2. Because SAED pattern in Fig. 3(l) recorded from precipitate P11 is also accordant with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783) in the zone axis of [011], the precipitate was identified as Cr-rich M23C6 phase with an fcc crystal structure. The present irradiation induced the precipitation of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with the morphology of a parallelogram in the matrix and at lath boundaries.
Fig. 4(a,c) are TEM micrographs of the irradiated thin foils, showing two arrow-marked precipitates P12 and P13. The composition of the metal fraction in these two precipitates is given in Table 2, revealing that precipitates P12 and P13 are Cr-rich and Cr-Fe-rich phases, respectively. SAED patterns in Fig. 4(b) and (d) taken from P12 and P13 are not consistent with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35-0783) in any zone axis, but accordant with the ED patterns from the chromium nitride, Cr2N (hexagonal lattice with lattice parameters a/c = 0.776/0.4438 nm) reported in the literature [28], in the two zone axes of [0 0 1] and [1 2 2], respectively. Thus, precipitates P12 and P13 were identified to be Cr-rich M2X (Cr2N type) phase with a hexagonal crystal structure. It is noted that SAED patterns shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d) are not consistent with the ED pattern from the Cr2C recorded in JCPDS database, such as Cr2C (JCPDS file 14–0519, hexagonal crystal structure with lattice parameters of a = 0.279 nm and c = 0.446 nm), in any zone axis. The Cr-rich M2X precipitate based on Cr2N and/or Cr2C phase does not exist in the 11Cr steel with the normalized and tempered condition. The observed Cr-rich M2X (Cr2N type) precipitates in the irradiated thin foils were induced by the present irradiation.

(b) and (d) SAED patterns from precipitates P12 and P13 indexed in terms of the EDPs of Cr2N in the two zone axes of [0 0 1] and [1 2 2], respectively.

Fig. 5(a) and (b) are bright field and dark field TEM micrographs of the irradiated thin foils respectively, showing arrow-marked precipitate P14. This precipitate is Cr-rich phase, and its metallic element composition is listed in Table 2. SAED pattern from this precipitate, as shown in Fig. 5(c), is consistent with the ED pattern of the Cr7C3 (JCPDS file 36–1482, simple orthorhombic crystal structure with lattice parameters a/b/c = 0.70149/1.2153/0.4532 nm) in the zone axis of [4 3 2]. TEM micrograph shown in Fig. 5(d) was also taken from the irradiated thin foil. As shown in Table 2, the EDX results from precipitate P15 marked with arrow in Fig. 5(d) hint that this precipitate also belongs to a Cr-rich phase. Fig. 5 (e) shows SAED pattern from precipitate P15, which is not consistent with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 or Cr2C or Cr2N phase, but consistent with the ED pattern of the Cr7C3 (JCPDS file 36–1482) in the zone axis of [4 1 0]. From these indexing results, precipitates P14 and P15 can be determined as Cr-rich M7C3 phase with a simple orthorhombic crystal structure. It can be noted that another set of patterns is mixed in Fig. 5(e), which is shown separately in Fig. 5(f). And this pattern was found to match with the ED pattern of the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783) in the zone axis of [1 1 1]. So, precipitate P15 is a multiphase precipitate composed of the Cr7C3 and Cr23C6. Since there are no Cr-rich M7C3 precipitates in the tempered 11Cr steel, the present irradiation induced the formation of Cr-rich M7C3 phase.

The present tempered 11Cr steel contains approximately 15 % (area fraction) δ-ferrite formed during solidification process due to steel composition having a high Cr equivalent Creq [29]. Fig. 6(a) is the TEM micrograph of unirradiated thin foils, showing a δ-ferrite grain and martensite laths along with precipitates at boundaries between martensite and δ-ferrite. In the tempered 11Cr steel, there is no precipitate within most δ-ferrite grains, and only a few precipitates are present within a few δ-ferrite grains. Fig. 6(b,c,e) are the TEM micrographs of three δ-ferrite grains taken from the irradiated thin foils, displaying a great many dispersed precipitates within the δ-ferrite grains. Therefore, the present irradiation induced the precipitation of a great many dispersed precipitates within δ-ferrite phase. Fig. 6(d,f) are two enlarged TEM micrographs of the dotted square areas in Fig. 6(c,e), respectively. EDX results from precipitates P16 and P17 in Fig. 6(d), as shown in Table 2, indicate that these two precipitates are all Fe-Cr-rich precipitates. The EDX results within the dotted circle P18 in Fig. 6(f) also show that the precipitates within the circle are rich in Fe and Cr. SAED pattern shown in Fig. 6(g) was taken from the dotted circle P18 in Fig. 6(f). This pattern consists of two sets of patterns, marked with large circles and small circles respectively. The pattern marked with large circles matches with the ED pattern of the Fe (JCPDS file 89–4186, body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice with lattice parameter a = 0.2931 nm) in the zone axis of [0 0 1]. This pattern was from the matrix of δ-ferrite. After trying to index the pattern marked with small circles in terms of Fe and Cr carbides and nitrides such as the Fe3C, Fe2C, Fe7C3, Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783), Cr2C (JCPDS file 14–0519) and Cr7C3 (JCPDS file 36–1482), it was found that the pattern was not accordant with the ED pattern from these phases, but matched well with the ED pattern from the Cr3C2 (JCPDS file 03–0935, simple orthorhombic crystal structure with lattice parameters a/b/c = 1.146/0.552/0.2821 nm) in the zone axis of [2 1 0]. Thus, these irradiation-induced dense precipitates within δ-ferrite were identified as Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) phase with a simple orthorhombic crystal structure. According to Fig. 6(g), there seems to be an orientation relationship between the irradiation-induced Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) and δ-ferrite, e.g. [210]Cr3C2 // [0 0 1]δ-ferrite and 
 Cr3C2 // 
 δ-ferrite.

Nb-rich precipitates
Fig. 7(a) is the TEM micrograph of unirradiated thin foil and shows precipitate P19 marked with arrow. EDX results from this precipitate, as shown in Table 2, reveal that it is Nb-Ta-rich phase. SAED pattern in Fig. 7 (b) recorded from precipitate P19 is consistent with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 38-1364, fcc lattice with lattice parameter a = 0.4469 nm) in the zone axis of [1 1 2]. So, precipitate P19 was identified as Nb-Ta-rich MX phase with an fcc crystal structure and an approximate lattice parameter a = 0.4469 nm.

(j) SAED patterns from precipitate P22 indexed in terms of the EDP of Nb6C5 in the zone axis of 
.

Fig. 7(c,d,e) are the TEM micrographs of the irradiated thin foils, showing three arrow-marked precipitates P20-P22. EDX results from these three precipitates, as shown in Table 2, indicate that they belong to Nb-Ta-rich phases. Since SAED pattern in Fig. 7(f) taken from precipitate P20 coincides with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 38–1364) in the zone axis of [013], it can be determined as Nb-Ta-rich MX with an fcc crystal structure and a lattice parameter of about 0.4469 nm. Precipitate P20 is considered as the Nb-Ta-rich MX phase based on NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) pre-existing in the tempered 11Cr steel. This indicated that the type or nature of the Nb-Ta-rich MX phase did not change under the present irradiation.
SAED patterns in Fig. 7(g,h,i) were all taken from precipitate P21 by tilting the thin foil specimen. The pattern shown in Fig. 7(g) was found to be completely inconsistent with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 38–1364) in any zone axis, but it matched well with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 17-0127, fcc lattice with lattice parameter a = 1.115 nm) in the zone axis of [1 1 1]. According to this indexing results, precipitate P21 can be identified to be Nb-Ta-rich MX phase with an fcc crystal structure and an approximate lattice parameter a = 1.115 nm. This phase is absent in the tempered 11Cr steel. The present irradiation induced the formation of Nb-Ta-rich MX phase based on the NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm). The pattern shown in Fig. 7(h) is consistent with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 38-1364) in the zone axis of [1 1 2]. One can see that another set of patterns is mixed in Fig. 7(h), which is shown separately in Fig. 7(i). By indexing the pattern of Fig. 7(i) in terms of Nb carbides recorded in JCPDS database including the NbC (JCPDS file 38–1364 and 17–0127), the pattern was found to be inconsistent with the ED pattern from above two kinds of NbC phases, but match well with the ED pattern from Nb2C (JCPDS 19–0858, simple orthorhombic lattice with lattice parameters a/b/c = 1.092/0.4974/0.309 nm) in the zone axis of [1 0 0]. The Nb2C phase is also absent in the tempered 11Cr steel, so it is an irradiation-induced phase. These indexing results reveal that precipitate P21 is a multiphase precipitate composed of NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) pre-existing in unirradiated steel, irradiation-induced NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm) and Nb2C (simple orthorhombic, a/b/c = 1.092/0.4974/0.309 nm) phases. This result seems to hint that the NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) phase is unstable under the present irradiation and may has undergone a transformation to the NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm) and Nb2C phases.
Fig. 7(j) shows the SAED pattern of precipitate P22. This pattern is completely inconsistent with the ED pattern from the NbC (JCPDS file 38–1364) in any zone axis. By indexing this pattern according to Nb carbides recorded in in JCPDS database, it was found to match well with the ED pattern from the Nb5C2 (JCPDS file 37–1201, base-centered monoclinic lattice with lattice parameters a/b/c = 0.54605/0.94597/0.54605 nm and β = 109.47 deg) in the zone axis of 
. So, precipitate P22 was determined to be a Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase with a base-centered monoclinic crystal structure. Because there is no such Nb carbide in the tempered 11Cr steel, the identified Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase belongs to an irradiation-induced new phase. This indicates that the present irradiation can induce the formation of Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase.
Intermetallic compounds
Fig. 8(a,b) are the TEM micrographs of unirradiated thin foil, showing a δ-ferrite grain and two arrow-marked precipitates P23 and P24 at boundary between martensite and δ-ferrite. Large-sized precipitate P23 is rich in Fe and W and contains a certain amount of Cr, while small-sized precipitate P24 attached to precipitate P23 is rich in Cr and Fe and contains more carbon. The metallic element composition of these two precipitates is listed in Table 2. Fig. 8(c) shows SAED pattern recorded from precipitate P23. This pattern is completely inconsistent with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783), Cr2C (JCPDS file 14–0519), Cr7C3 (JCPDS file 36–1482) and Cr3C2 (JCPDS file 03–0935 in any zone axis, instead, it matches well with the σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708, simple tetragonal crystal structure with the lattice parameters a/c = 0.8799/0.4544 nm) in the zone axis of [0 1 1]. Therefore, precipitate P23 was identified as a σ-FeCr intermetallic compound having a simple tetragonal crystal structure. The carbon content in the EDX results of precipitate P23 should come from the adjacent precipitate P24 belonging to a Cr-Fe-rich carbide.

Fig. 8. TEM micrographs taken from the unirradiated and irradiated thin foils of 11Cr F/M steel along with SAED patterns from precipitates. (a) and (b) micrographs of unirradiated thin foil showing arrow-marked σ-FeCr intermetallic compound P23. (c) SAED pattern from precipitate P23 indexed in terms of the EDP of σ-FeCr in the zone axis of [0 1 1].

(h) SAED pattern from intermetallic compound P26 indexed in terms of the EDP of Fe-Cr in the zone axis of [1 1 3]. (i) SAED patterns from intermetallic compound P27 indexed in terms of the EDPs of Fe-Cr in the zone axis of [0 0 1] and σ-FeCrW in the zone axis of [1 1 1].

TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 8(d,e,f) were taken from the irradiated thin foils, displaying precipitates P25-P27 distributed at boundaries between martensite and δ-ferrite. These three precipitates are rich in Fe and W and contain a certain amount of Cr, as shown in Table 2. SAED pattern in Fig. 8(g) was from precipitate P25 and found to be inconsistent with the ED pattern from the σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708), but consistent with the ED pattern from the σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 05–0703, base-centered tetragonal crystal structure with the lattice parameters a/c = 0.6489/0.9483 nm) in the zone axis of [012]. Precipitate P25 could be identified as a σ-FeCrW intermetallic compound having a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. Because only two types of intermetallic compounds, i.e., the σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708) and σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 09–0050, simple tetragonal crystal structure with lattice parameters a/c = 0.9170/0.4741 nm) are present in the tempered 11Cr steel [27], the σ-FeCrW intermetallic compound identified in this work should be an irradiation-induced phase.
SAED pattern in Fig. 8(h) was taken from large-sized precipitate P26. This pattern does not match with the ED pattern from the σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708), σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS files 09–0050 and 05–0703) in any zone axis. However, this pattern was found to be consistent with the ED pattern from the Fe-Cr (JCPDS file 34–0396, bcc lattice with lattice parameter a = 0.2876 nm) in the zone axis of [113]. No this Fe-Cr phase was observed in the tempered 11Cr steel, thus the present irradiation induced the formation of Fe-Cr intermetallic compound phase.
Fig. 8(i) is from precipitate P27, which has a large size and does not contain carbon and nitrogen, and reveals two sets of SAED patterns marked with large circles and small circles respectively. The pattern marked with large circles is very clear, and consistent with the ED pattern from the Fe-Cr (JCPDS file 34–0396) in the zone axis of [001]. The pattern marked with small circles is not clear but visible. This pattern is consistent with the ED pattern from the σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 05–0703) in the zone axis of [111]. So, precipitate P27 is a multiphase precipitate composed of two irradiation-induced intermetallic compound phases Fe-Cr and σ-FeCrW.
Discussion
This study shows that the present irradiation has no obvious effect on the composition of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates, i.e., the concentration ratio of Cr and Fe in Cr-rich M23C6, in the tempered 11Cr steel. It was suggested that the composition of M23C6 precipitates in high Cr F/M steels was not changed by irradiations with high-energy Ni ions at 300–600 °C to 40–200 dpa [15], and with neutrons at 300–670 °C to 6.7–39 dpa [12], [19]. Our previous studies also indicated that the Cr/Fe ratio of the M23C6 precipitates was not changed for the tempered and the TMT-strengthened high Cr F/M steel P92 after 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ion irradiation at 400 and 700 °C to 0.66 and 0.75 dpa [16], [21], respectively. The present result is in line with these reported results, but inconsistent with the result that the Cr/Fe ratio of M23C6 precipitates pre-existing in high Cr F/M steel T91 was decreased by the irradiation with protons at 500 °C to 7 dpa [20].
M23C6 precipitates P7-P9 with the Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.07 were observed in the irradiated 11Cr steel. Semicircular shaped precipitates, like precipitates P7 and P9, have never been observed in the tempered 11Cr steel. Since this study has proved that the composition of M23C6 precipitates with the Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.84 in the tempered 11Cr steel is almost unaffected by the present irradiation, precipitates P7-P9 are most likely to belong to the M23C6 phase precipitated from the matrix induced by the irradiation, but not a pre-existing Cr-rich M23C6 phase with changed composition due to irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3(d,e), there are some large-sized precipitates around precipitates P7-P9, which should be pre-existing Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates in the tempered steel. There pre-existing Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates have consumed a significant amount of Cr in the matrix, so the M23C6 precipitates formed from these low-Cr matrix regions contain a low amount of Cr, resulting in the M23C6 precipitates with the Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.07.
In tempered 9–12Cr martensitic steels, Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates are distributed along the lath, block and packet boundaries and the prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGBs), while Nb- and V-rich MX precipitates are distributed at laths, blocks, packet boundaries and PAGBs as well as in the matrix within laths [4]. In the case of the present tempered 11Cr steel, Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates were observed at martensite lath boundaries, PAGBs and boundaries between martensite and δ-ferrite, and absent within martensite laths. The present irradiation induced Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within martensite laths. From Fig. 3(a,b,f), one can see that there is almost no precipitate at the boundaries of martensite laths with irradiation-induced Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates inside. This hinted that no precipitate formed at these boundaries during the tempering of the steel. Thus, the Cr and carbon content in the matrix of these martensite laths without precipitation is relatively high, leading to the precipitation of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within the laths during the irradiation.
It has been suggested that alloy carbides only begin to precipitate at a tempering temperature higher than 500 °C, where the substitutional solutes in alloy matrix diffuse rapidly [30]. For example, M23C6-type carbides were observed in a high-Cr F/M steel P91 tempered at 500 and 600 °C for 1 h [31], 10Cr F/M steels tempered at 600, 650, 700, 750, 780 and 800 °C for 2 h [32], niobium modified 9Cr F/M steel tempered at 700 °C for 5 h [33] and 9Cr F/M steel P92 tempered at 700 °C for 1 h [34]. According to the results of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations of the present 11Cr F/M steel [35], equilibrium phase M23C6 may be formed in the steel when the steel is subjected to a thermal aging or a tempering at temperatures ranging from 500 to 800 °C. In fact, M23C6 precipitates were observed in the normalized 11Cr F/M steel after a tempering at 600 °C for 1.5 h [35]. From these reported results, it can be inferred that M23C6 carbide phase can be precipitated from the matrix of the normalized 11Cr F/M steel during a tempering at 700 °C. However, for the thin foils prepared from the present 11Cr steel that has been tempered at 780 °C for 1.5 h, it can be considered that no precipitate phases involving M23C6 carbide will precipitate in the thin foils under a thermal aging at 700 °C for 2 h, although the temperature of 700 °C is suitable for the precipitation of M23C6 phase. This behavior can be explained as follows. The unirradiated thin foil specimens were prepared from the 11Cr steel that underwent a normalizing at 1050 °C for 0.5 h followed by a tempering at 780 °C for 1.5 h. During the normalizing, the dissolution of numerous carbides such as Cr-rich M23C6 increased the carbon concentration in the austenitic matrix with a high solubility of carbon, resulting in ferrite/martensite with a low solubility of carbon and a supersaturated carbon state after cooling. In the tempering process, the supersaturated carbon in ferrite/martensite precipitated as carbides such as Cr-rich M23C6, forming a relatively stable microstructure of tempered martensite along with abundant carbides. Since the supersaturated carbon had been largely precipitated as carbides during the high-temperature tempering process, the steel matrix no longer remained in a supersaturated carbon state. Consequently, when the tempered steel was subjected to a short-term thermal aging at 700 °C obviously lower than the tempering temperature of 780 °C, the tendency for carbide precipitation from the steel matrix was minimal. Therefore, the observed rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within the martensite laths, parallelogram-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates and M23C6 precipitates with the Cr/Fe ratio of about 1.07 are all irradiation-induced M23C6 phase. It was suggested that the growth of precipitates enhanced by irradiation could be attributed to the irradiation assisted diffusion [20]. The formation of irradiation-induced M23C6 phase was attributed to the irradiation assisted diffusion of Cr and other metal atoms in the matrix of the tempered martensite.
Since Cr is ferrite forming element, the concentration of solute Cr in δ-ferrite matrix is higher than that in martensite matrix of the 11Cr F/M steel after the normalization [27]. After the tempering at 780 °C for 1.5 h, the concentration of solute Cr in δ-ferrite matrix is still high because there is almost no carbide precipitation in the matrix during the tempering due to a low solubility of carbon in ferrite. The δ-ferrite matrix with high Cr content is conducive to the formation of precipitate phase rich in Cr. Irradiation can lead to the formation of various nano-sized defects, including black dots, dislocation loops, dislocation lines and voids, in δ-ferrite [36]. Irradiation-induced defects, such as black dots, dislocation loops and dislocation lines, can interact with solute C atoms, resulting in a segregation of C atoms and a formation of C-enriched regions on the defects and in the vicinity of the defects. Hence, Cr-rich carbide nuclei can form at the defects and grow by irradiation-enhanced carbon diffusion [37]. Due to the low carbon content in δ-ferrite, the growth of the Cr-rich carbides is limited and small precipitates are formed eventually in the δ-ferrite matrix.
The formation sequence of Cr-rich carbides/carbonitrides in the martensite of high-Cr F/M steels after austenitizing treatment during the tempering process from low temperatures (<350 °C) to high temperatures (≥750 oC) is Cr7C3, Cr2(C,N) and Cr23C6 [3]. During the present irradiation, Cr7C3 carbides may also form preferentially than Cr2(C,N) carbonitride and Cr23C6 carbide in the δ-ferrite matrix, and the formed Cr7C3 carbides subsequently transform into Cr3C2 carbides through a chemical reaction of 3/7 < Cr7C3> + 5/7 < C> = <Cr3C2> [35] in combination with carbon diffusion enhanced by irradiation. This may be the reason why the precipitates observed in δ-ferrite belong to Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 based on Cr3C2 and not to Cr-rich M7C3, M2X and M23C6 phases. The high Fe content in precipitates P16 and P17 is due to their small size, so that their EDX analyses were greatly affected by the Fe in the matrix, resulting in a high Fe content in the precipitates.
Nb-rich MC/MX precipitates based on NbC carbide, which were present in steels such as austenitic stainless steels with a solid solution condition and high-Cr martensitic steels with the normalized-and-tempered, aged, crept and TMT conditions, were reported to have an fcc crystal structure and lattice parameters ranging from 0.4216 to 0.447 nm [3], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. This study indicates the occurrence of Nb-rich MX precipitates based on NbC carbide (fcc a = 1.115 nm) in the tempered 11Cr F/M steel under the irradiation. So far there seems to be no report of NbC or Nb-rich MX precipitates with an fcc crystal structure and a lattice parameter of approximately 1.115 nm in high-Cr F/M steels in any state and under any irradiation conditions.
The conclusions of studies on whether irradiation affects the lattice parameter of Nb-rich MX precipitates based on NbC carbide (fcc, a = about 0.45 nm) are inconsistent. It was reported that Nb-rich MX precipitates belonging to NbC carbide (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) in the normalized-and-tempered and TMT-strengthened P92 steels remained after the steels were irradiated with 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ions at 400 and 700 °C to 0.66 and 0.74 dpa, respectively [21], [23]. On the contrary, there have been reports of changes in the lattice parameter of NbC caused by irradiation. After single-phase NbC thin films were irradiated with 600 keV Ar ions and 200 keV He ions at room temperature, the lattice parameter of NbC increased and reached a maximum value which was greater than the initial value by 0.4 % at 0.3 dpa and then decreased down to a value which was 0.5 % smaller than the initial value at 8 dpa [43]. It was reported that during 300 keV He+ ion irradiation, the lattice parameter of NbC carbide went through a maximum at about 0.5 dpa and then dropped a saturation value at 100 dpa, revealing a total variation of about 1 % in the lattice parameter [44]. These reports indicate that the lattice parameter changes caused by irradiation are very small. Thus, the occurrence of NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm) in the irradiated steel is not a case of irradiation-induced the lattice parameter change of Nb-rich MX (NbC type, fcc, a = 0.4469 nm), but the formation of a new phase NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm).
Since precipitate P21 in Fig. 7(d) is rich in Nb, and SAED patterns in Fig. 7(g,h,i) all from the precipitate exhibit the patterns of NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm), NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) and the Nb2C phases, respectively, the precipitate was identified to be a multiphase precipitate consisting of these three phases. Before the irradiation, Nb-rich phase in the 11Cr F/M steel consists only of NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm). This seems to indicate that after the irradiation the amount of NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) in precipitate P21 decreased, suggesting that the partial dissolution of NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) occurred during the irradiation. Meanwhile, new Nb carbides NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm) and the Nb2C were formed in situ on precipitate P21 and by the release of Nb and C atoms from the dissolution of NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) phase.
Nb2C and Nb2(C,N) phases were observed in solution-treated 17Cr-0.86Si-1.2Cu-0.5Nb ferrite stainless steel (FSS) after thermal aging at 650 °C for 1 h and annealed 18Cr-2Mo FSS after isothermal aging at 800 °C for 2 h [45], [46], respectively. Nb2(C,N) phase was also present in 12Cr F/M steel ChS-139 tempered at 720 °C for 2 h [47]. Precipitate based on Nb2C/Nb2(C,N) phases does not exist in most high-Cr F/M steels including the present tempered 11Cr steel. The enthalpy of formation for Nb2C and NbC phases was given as approximately −60 and −70 KJ/mol, respectively [48]. This suggests that the thermodynamic stability of NbC phase is better than that of Nb2C phase, in other words, the formation temperature of Nb2C phase should be lower than that of NbC phase. Because Nb-rich MC and MX precipitates were proved to form in Nb-modified 8.8Cr and P92 steels during a tempering at 700 ℃ for 1 h [33], [34], respectively, the formation of the Nb2C phase under the present irradiation at 700 °C for 2 h is understandable.
There are a few reports about the presence of Nb6C5 carbide in steels. Nb6C5 carbides were found to form in austenitized Nb-bearing medium Cr wear-resistant cast steel tempered at 200 °C for 2 h [49], and Fe-27Al-1Nb alloys crept at 600–800 °C [50]. He and co-workers [21] proved the presence of Nb6C5 phase mixed with NbC (f.c.c., a = 0.4469 nm) phase in tempered P92 steel after 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ion irradiation at 400 ℃ to 0.66 dpa, and suggested that the Nb6C5 phase might be formed by nucleation and growth processes, or a transformation from Nb-rich MX type precipitate with an fcc crystal structure. Recently, Wang and Shen [22] also observed Nb-rich M6C5 precipitates in TMT-strengthened P92 steel after irradiation with 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ions at 400 °C to 0.68 dpa.
Above reports indicate that Nb6C5 phase can exist over a wide temperature range from 200 to 800 °C. The present irradiation temperature of 700 °C falls within the temperature range, so it is highly likely to form Nb6C5 phase during the irradiation. On the other hand, the unirradiated thin foils came from the steel that was tempered at 780 °C for 1.5 h, making it unlikely for the precipitation of Nb-rich phase again under a single thermal aging or tempering at 700 °C. Thus, the occurrence of the identified Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase must be related to the irradiation. The Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase may precipitate in the Nb-C-rich regions formed by the dissolution of NbC precipitates due to the irradiation, and the irradiation enhanced Nb and C diffusion promotes the growth of the Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 phase. Another possible mechanism for the formation of Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 precipitates can be described as follows. While a Nb-Ta-rich MX precipitate based on NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) is being dissolved due to the irradiation, the Nb6C5 phase is formed in situ on the basis of Nb-Ta-rich MX precipitate by means of the Nb, Ta and C atoms released from the MX precipitate dissolution, and finally the Nb-Ta-rich MX precipitate is completely dissolved and replaced by a Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 precipitate entirely belonging to the Nb6C5 phase. Meanwhile, irradiation enhanced Nb diffusion can supplement the Nb atoms needed for the growth of the M6X5 precipitate.
Shen and co-workers [27] observed σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708) intermetallic compounds and Cr-rich M23C6 carbides at boundaries between δ-ferrite and martensite in the 11Cr F/M steel with the normalized and tempered condition. And they also observed σ-FeCrW intermetallic compounds based on σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 09–0050, simple tetragonal crystal structure with lattice parameters a/c = 0.9170/0.4741 nm), which exhibited a large size and different blocky morphologies, on the carbon replica samples prepared from the same normalized-and-tempered steel. Since Cr and W are ferrite forming elements, the concentration of solutes Cr and W in δ-ferrite matrix was determined to be higher than that in martensite matrix of the 11Cr F/M steel after the normalization [27]. Sigma phase enriched in Fe, Cr and W is more likely to form in δ-ferrite than in martensite. On the other hand, since carbon in solid solution prevents the formation of sigma phase due to its inability to dissolve carbon [51], sigma phase should be likely to form in the carbon-depleted regions. The carbon content in δ-ferrite is much lower than that in martensite due to a low solubility of carbon in ferrite. Therefore, sigma phase is more likely to form in the δ-ferrite with higher Cr and W and low C content. In this study, sigma phase based on σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708) was observed within the δ-ferrite adjacent to the boundary between δ-ferrite and martensite in the unirradiated thin foil, as shown by precipitate P23 in Fig. 8(a,b). As tempering at 780 °C for 1.5 h has induced the formation of many σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708) and Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates at boundaries between δ-ferrite and martensite in the 11Cr F/M steel, it can be considered that no precipitate phases will precipitate at the boundaries in the unirradiated thin foils due to a thermal aging at 700 °C for 2 h. Sigma phase σ-FeCrW belonging to σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 05–0703), as shown by precipitate P25 in Fig. 8(d), should be induced by the irradiation at 700 °C. This sigma phase, i.e., precipitate P25 marked with arrow in Fig. 8(d), may first nucleate at the δ-ferrite-martensite boundary with a carbon-depleted region caused by the precipitation of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates at the boundary during the tempering, and then the nucleus grows into the δ-ferrite grain by means of the irradiation enhanced diffusion of solute Cr and W atoms in the δ-ferrite.
Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds were observed at the interface between 304 austenitic stainless steel and mild steel composite plates, which were prepared by casting and hot rolling process [52]. There appear to have no previous reports of Fe-Cr intermetallic compound phase identified in high-Cr F/M steels with the normalized and tempered condition. Zhang and co-workers [53] observed Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds with a bcc crystal structure and lattice parameter a = 0.2876 nm in the tempered RAFM (reduced activation ferritic/martensitic) steel CLAM after 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ion irradiation at 400 °C to 0.53 dpa. The irradiation-induced Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds identified in this study have the same crystal structure and lattice parameter as they observed. Regarding the possible mechanism of irradiation-induced Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds in the tempered CLAM steel, Zhang and co-workers [53] suggested that the nucleation of Fe-Cr phase was attributed to the formation of Fe-rich/Cr-rich carbides (such as irradiation-induced Fe-rich M3C carbides) at the matrix and grain boundaries, and the growth of Fe-Cr phase was related to the release of Cr atoms caused by the dissolution of Cr-rich M7C3 carbides during irradiation. According to the TEM results in this study, Fe-rich M3C carbide formation and Cr-rich M7C3 carbide dissolution are not involved, so the mechanism of Fe-Cr phase formation they proposed cannot explain the existence of Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds in the irradiated thin foils.
In this study, Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds were observed only within the δ-ferrite adjacent to the boundaries between δ-ferrite and martensite in the irradiated thin foils, hinting that the formation of Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds is closely related to the δ-ferrite composition characteristics and the irradiation. Like σ-FeCr and σ-FeCrW sigma phases, Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds should be also more likely to form at δ-ferrite-martensite boundaries and within δ-ferrite with higher Cr and W and low C content. It can be inferred that the observed Fe-Cr intermetallic compound, i.e., precipitate P26 marked with arrow in Fig. 8(e), first nucleate at the δ-ferrite-martensite boundaries with carbon-depleted regions, and then the nuclei grow into the δ-ferrite through the irradiation enhanced Cr and W diffusion in the δ-ferrite. In the case of precipitate P27, since it shows mixed SAED patterns of Fe-Cr and σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 05–0703) phases, there are two possible mechanisms for its formation. The first is that a small amount of the σ-FeCrMo is formed simultaneously as Fe-Cr phase is induced to form by irradiation, and eventually a large precipitate composed of two phases is formed by means of irradiation enhanced Cr and W diffusion. The other is that the σ-FeCrMo phase forms first under irradiation, and then most of this irradiation-induced phase transforms into Fe-Cr phase, leaving a small residual amount of σ-FeCrMo phase that shows weak diffraction spots. In addition, it is noted that the pattern marked with small circles in Fig. 8(i) seems to match with the ED pattern from the Cr23C6 (JCPDS file 35–0783) in the zone axis of [0 1 1] as well, but with a large indexing error compared with the indexing results according to the σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS file 05–0703). This raises a question that whether Fe-Cr phase may have been transformed from Cr-rich M23C6 pre-existing at δ-ferrite-martensite boundaries under irradiation. Because no two sigma phases σ-FeCr (JCPDS file 05–0708) and σ-FeCrMo (JCPDS files 09–0050) pre-existing in the tempered 11Cr F/M steel were identified in the irradiated thin foils, it is also possible that during irradiation, Fe-Cr phase formed in situ within the σ-FeCr or/and σ-FeCrMo through a transformation or a dissolution of the σ-FeCr or/and σ-FeCrMo by irradiation. The formation mechanism of irradiation-induced Fe-Cr intermetallic compounds in the 11Cr F/M steel requires further investigations.
This study indicates that the present irradiation causes significant changes in the precipitate phases of the experimental steel, especially the occurrence of various irradiation-induced phases. Some of these irradiation-induced phases may affect the mechanical properties of the steel. The principal and most stable carbide formed in 9–12 % Cr F/M steels is M23C6, which provides the basic creep strength by stabilizing the grain and subgrain structure [54]. It is possible that the irradiation-induced Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates, including rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 within the laths and parallelogram-like Cr-rich M23C6 in the matrix and at lath boundaries, have a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the 11Cr steel. Because Cr3C2 carbide has good high-temperature oxidation resistance, and good chemical stability and high hardness [55], it has been used as particulate reinforcements to produce wear- and corrosion-resistant materials, for example, surface layer wear-resistant steels [56], [57]. Therefore, irradiation-induced the precipitation of many dense Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) precipitates within δ-ferrite grains, as shown in Fig. 6 (b-f), may improve the high-temperature (below 700 °C) mechanical properties of the 11Cr steel. Due to the lack of understanding of the thermal stability of Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) phase under long-term thermal aging or creep exposure at high temperatures, it is difficult to predict the effect of these irradiation-induced Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) precipitates on the long-term high-temperature mechanical properties of the steel. Although other irradiation-induced phases, including Cr-rich M2X (Cr2N type), Cr-rich M7C3, Nb-Ta-rich MX (NbC type, fcc, a = 1.115 nm), Nb2C, Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 (Nb6C5 type), σ-FeCrW and Fe-Cr, were also observed in the irradiated specimens, we are currently unable to speculate the effect of these irradiation-induced phases on the mechanical properties of the 11Cr steel. In addition to the nature of precipitate phases, the amount, distribution and thermal stability of precipitate phases also have a great influence on the high-temperature mechanical properties of steels. These issues with these irradiation-induced phases need to be studied.
This paper presents for the first time a study focusing on the precipitates change of 11Cr F/M steel under irradiation conditions. The study achieved significant original results, particularly regarding irradiation-induced precipitation of rod- and parallelogram-like M23C6 within laths and matrix, and a great many dispersed Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) within δ-ferrite grains, as well as the formation of new types of Nb precipitate phases including NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm), Nb2C and Nb6C5. And this study demonstrates that the high Cr F/M steel exhibits significant variations in the type, number, morphology, and distribution of precipitate phases even under low-dose irradiation below the maximum service temperature of fuel cladding, which may influence the operational performance of fuel cladding of the fast reactors. This study highlights the crucial role of low-dose irradiation in evaluating microstructural radiation stability of nuclear structural materials.
Conclusions
The precipitate phases of normalized-and-tempered 11Cr F/M steel after 3.5 MeV Fe13+ ion irradiation at 700 °C–0.84 dpa have been studied using TEM in comparison with those of the unirradiated steel. The study has led to the following conclusions.
Irradiation has a small effect on the composition of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitate phase pre-existing in the tempered steel, as Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a Cr/Fe ratio of approximately 1.8 are observed in both unirradiated and irradiated thin foil specimens. Irradiation induced the precipitation of Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a Cr/Fe ratio of approximately 1.0, rod-like Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates within martensite laths, and Cr-rich M23C6 precipitates with a parallelogram morphology in the matrix and at lath boundaries due to the irradiation enhanced diffusion of Cr and other atoms in the tempered martensite. Irradiation-induced Cr-rich M2X (Cr2N type) and Cr-rich M7C3 precipitates also occur in the irradiated thin foil specimens. Irradiation leads to the precipitation of a great many dispersed Fe-Cr-rich M3X2 (Cr3C2 type) precipitates with a simple orthorhombic crystal structure within δ-ferrite, which may be attributed to irradiation-induced fine defects along with a segregation of C atoms on the defects, and transformation from Cr7C3 phase to Cr3C2 phase in combination with irradiation enhanced carbon diffusion.
The nature of Nb-rich precipitates pre-existing in the tempered steel is significantly changed by irradiation. While Nb-Ta-rich MX precipitates based on NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) pre-existing in the tempered steel remain in the irradiated thin foil specimens, irradiation induces the formation of three types of Nb-rich precipitate phases. They are Nb-Ta-rich MX carbonitride based on NbC (fcc, a = 1.115 nm), Nb2C carbide (simple orthorhombic lattice, a/b/c = 1.092/0.4974/0.309 nm), and Nb-Ta-rich M6X5 carbonitride based on Nb6C5 (base-centered monoclinic lattice, a/b/c = 0.54605/0.94597/0.54605 nm and β = 109.47 deg). The formation of these Nb-rich phases should be closely related to the partial or complete dissolution of some Nb-Ta-rich MX precipitates based on NbC (fcc, a = 0.4469 nm) during irradiation and the irradiation enhanced diffusion of Nb and C atoms.
Irradiation causes some changes in the type of intermetallic compound phases pre-existing in the tempered steel. Intermetallic compounds based on σ-FeCr (simple tetragonal lattice, a/c = 0.8799/0.4544 nm) and σ-FeCrMo (simple tetragonal lattice, a/c = 0.9170/0.4741 nm) pre-existing in the tempered steel are not observed in the irradiated thin foil specimens. Irradiation induces the formation of two types of intermetallic compound phases, σ-FeCrW intermetallic compound based on σ-FeCrMo (base-centered tetragonal lattice, a/c = 0.6489/0.9483 nm) and Fe-Cr (bcc, a = 0.2876 nm) intermetallic compound distributed within the δ-ferrite adjacent to δ-ferrite-martensite boundaries. The formation of the Fe-Cr phase should be related to some factors such as δ-ferrite containing higher Cr and W and low C content in addition to irradiation enhanced Cr and W diffusion in δ-ferrite.
