Abstract
During the use of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are very sensitive to temperature, so high or low temperatures will hurt the performance of the battery. In this paper, we mainly use computational fluid dynamics simulation methods to compare the effects of different cooling media, different flow channels, and coolant inlet locations on the temperature of the battery pack and select the optimal program. Then, the influence of liquid cooling plate material, flow channel spacing, and flow channel width were tested. The discrete-variable optimization scheme was designed, to solve the problem that the variables can only be optimized as discrete variables. Then design the continuous variable optimization scheme, and use the multi-island genetic algorithm to search for the optimal value, to arrive at the optimal value of the structural parameters. The structural parameters are rounded to obtain the aluminum liquid-cooled battery pack model with low manufacturing difficulty, low cost, 115 mm flow channel spacing, and 15 mm flow channel width. The maximum temperature of the battery thermal management system reduced by 0.274 K, and the maximum temperature difference is reduced by 0.338 K Finally, an energy-saving strategy is proposed for electric vehicles that can work normally at extreme temperatures. The effects of ambient temperature, coolant temperature and flow rate on the battery thermal management system are investigated. When the ambient temperature is 0–40 °C, by controlling the coolant temperature and regulating the coolant flow rate, the liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery thermal management system significantly reduces energy consumption by 37.87 %.

1. Introduction
With the increasing demands of modern society on material life, the shortage of resources and environmental pollution problems are becoming more and more serious [[1], [2], [3]]. In recent years, countries around the world have introduced policies to ban the sale of fuel vehicles, and studies have shown that new energy vehicles can achieve a 30–50 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and a 40–60 % increase in fuel efficiency compared to traditional fuel vehicles [4]. The power battery is an important part of the electric vehicle. Excessively high or low temperatures will hurt battery performance and may lead to premature failure of the battery system, or even cause dangerous accidents such as fires and explosions [5,6]. Battery thermal problems have always been one of the challenges faced by the new energy vehicle industry. In the future, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the research development and innovation of thermal management technology to ensure the safety and reliability of power batteries and provide a more solid foundation for the sustainable development of the new energy automobile industry [[7], [8], [9]].
The power of electric vehicles comes from the power supply system, and the performance of the power battery directly affects the range, charging time, service life and battery cost of electric vehicles and other important factors. Compared with other types of batteries, lithium-ion batteries have the advantages of higher operating voltage, greater energy density and longer cycle life, no memory effect, etc., so they are widely used in the field of new energy vehicles, becoming the most ideal power source [10,11]. At present, the lithium-ion batteries widely used in electric vehicles are lithium ternary and lithium iron phosphate batteries [8]. Predict battery life with modern machine learning [12]. Nelson et al. [13] studied the effect of ambient temperature on the battery pack, when the ambient temperature is 45 °C, the number of cycle life of the power battery will be reduced to 40 %, when the ambient temperature is more than 60 °C, the number of cycle life will be less than 600 times, when the ambient temperature is −30 °C, the output power of the battery with a rated power of 25 kW will be reduced by 80 %. Sheng research shows that with the decrease of ambient temperature and the increase of electrolyte concentration, the temperature, heat flux and heat production rate of the battery increase [14].
Secondly the temperature difference problem is magnified when the batteries are grouped. Battery packs in electric vehicles consist of cells with different capacities, voltages and internal resistances connected in series and parallel [15]. Wang et al. [16] showed that the reaction rate of the battery is affected by the temperature difference of the battery, and the larger the temperature difference, the more inconsistent the reaction rate of the battery, which leads to a reduction in the cycle life and performance of the battery. Feng et al. [17] found that the temperature difference of the battery pack will affect the battery's capacity and is positively correlated with the loss of battery capacity. Kuper et al. [18] investigated the effect of extreme environments on the temperature of the battery pack and found that when the temperature difference of the battery pack is 5 °C, the power of the battery pack will decrease by 10 %. Therefore, maintaining a uniform distribution of temperature inside the battery pack is the key to ensuring the safe operation of the battery. To ensure the good performance of the battery, the operating temperature of the lithium battery should be controlled at 25–40 °C, and the temperature difference between different single cells as well as the battery modules should be controlled below 5 °C [19].
In summary, in order to ensure that the power battery continues to perform optimally under various operating conditions, it is particularly important to design a set of scientific and reasonable battery thermal management systems. Common thermal management programs for power batteries can be categorized into air cooling, liquid cooling and phase change material cooling according to different heat transfer mediums [20,21]. Subramanian analyzed the shortcomings and progress of phase change material integrated battery thermal management system, and made a comprehensive evaluation of phase change material integrated battery thermal management system [22]. The liquid-cooled thermal management system adopts liquid fluid with higher thermal conductivity as the cooling medium, which can significantly improve the thermal management effect. Liquid-cooled battery thermal management system generally uses water, glycol, and thermal oil with smaller viscosity and higher thermal conductivity as the cooling medium [23,24]. Sheng et al. [25] studied the influence of fluid flow direction, velocity, channel size and cooling medium on the heat distribution of the battery. Increasing the fluid flow has positive and negative effects on minimizing the temperature rise and temperature difference of the battery. Glycol solution can reduce the temperature difference of the battery more than liquid water.
Li et al. [26] designed a liquid-cooled thermal management system for a battery module consisting of lithium iron phosphate batteries. Among them, the location of the cooling surface, the number of air inlets and the direction of coolant flow were included in the study to investigate their effects on the cooling effect. The results show that when the cooling surface is located between the cells, the number of inlet ports is three, and the coolant flow direction is arranged alternately, the maximum temperature of the battery module can be stabilized at 303.6 K, and the maximum temperature difference between the cells is only 2.3 K. The optimal mass flow rate of a single inlet port is 1.2 g/s. Sheng et al. [27] developed the serpentine channel cooling plate and provided a new method for designing Li-ion battery thermal management systems for controlling the temperature distribution of battery modules. Ren et al. [28] investigated the effect of changes in cold water flow rate and cold water inlet temperature on the bottom liquid-cooling thermal management system based on multi-channel flat tubes. The results show that this bottom liquid cooling thermal management system can effectively reduce the temperature rise of the battery module and has an insignificant effect on the temperature uniformity of the module. The cold water flow rate has little effect on the maximum temperature of the module. However, the change of cold water inlet temperature has a significant effect on the thermal management performance of the battery module. By reducing the cold water inlet temperature, the temperature of the battery module can be maintained below 45 °C. Tao et al. [29] investigated the heat dissipation structure of a serpentine channel cooling plate and proposed a number of different structural solutions by optimizing parameters such as the structural arrangement of the channels in the plate and the width of the flow channels. The pressure drop, cooling target average temperature, and temperature variance of the cooling plate were exhaustively analyzed. The results show that the gradual narrow-to-wide inlet channel can make the cell temperature distribution more uniform. Wang et al. [30] used a combination of one-way analysis and orthogonal tests to analyze the parameter sensitivity of factors such as inlet velocity, number of channels, and contact angle, and to improve the performance through structural optimization. The results showed that the order of influence of these factors on the cooling performance was contact angle, inlet velocity, and number of channels, with the contact angle having the most significant effect on the cooling performance, which was recommended to be maintained at about 70°. The number of channels, on the other hand, has a relatively minor effect on the cooling performance of large cell modules.
This paper will focus on the optimization of the liquid cooling thermal management system for lithium-ion batteries. Taking the lithium iron phosphate battery module liquid cooling system as the research object, comparing different heat dissipation schemes to ensure that the system works in the appropriate temperature range (25 °C–40 °C) and the maximum temperature difference is not more than 5 °C, and further reducing the maximum temperature difference through the discrete optimization scheme and the continuous optimization scheme. On the basis of the optimal liquid-cooled battery thermal management system, the coolant flow rate and temperature are adjusted to realize energy-saving control under the premise that the electric vehicle can work normally under extreme temperatures.
2. Battery pack model and methodology
2.1. Problem description

The three liquid-cooled plates are numbered from top to bottom as No. 1 liquid-cooled plate, No. 2 liquid-cooled plate and No. 3 liquid-cooled plate, and the geometric center of No. 2 liquid-cooled plate coincides with that of the liquid-cooled heat dissipation structure model.

2.2. Model of single cell
The battery selected in this paper is a commercial power square lithium iron phosphate battery, with a capacity of 50 Ah, a voltage of 3.2 V, a height of 260 mm, a length of 110 mm, and a thickness of 25 mm. Because the battery structure is complex and contains many tiny components, it will be more difficult to build the model and mesh. In order to simplify the model and reduce the computational complexity, when modeling the single cell, we can ignore the small components in the battery and the height of the poles [31]. The value of the heat production rate, q, is calculated according to Eq. (1) [32]. The thermal properties of the simplified lithium-ion battery are shown in Table 2 [33].

2.3. Governing equations
In order to describe the velocity distribution of the fluid and the temperature distribution of the battery pack, the governing equations of the CFD model involve the continuity equation, the momentum equation, and the energy equation, The governing equations are as follows [35]:
Continuity equation:

Momentum equations:

where u, v, and w denote the Reynolds average velocity components, m/s; p is the Reynolds average pressure, pa; T represents the air temperature, K and k is the air thermal conductivity.
2.4. Boundary conditions
The maximum Reynolds number of the fluid in the flow channel is greater than the critical Reynolds number of 2000, the Reynolds number is calculated by Eq. (7) to be 2964, so the flow models involved in the numerical simulation in this paper are all turbulence models, and the standard k-ε model is used for the calculation [35]. This method has good robustness and economy can better calculate a large range of turbulent flow models and has wide application in engineering. The fluid type is an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Involving the transfer of heat from the battery, the energy equation is opened. The heat generated by thermal radiation is negligible, so thermal radiation is not calculated.

Define the thermo-physical parameters of each component, including the thermo-physical parameters of the lithium iron phosphate battery, the thermo-physical parameters of the liquid-cooled plate, and the thermo-physical parameters of the coolant, as shown in Table 2.
Define the heat source, the internal heat generation rate of the battery is set: 29533 W/m3 for 2C discharge, the inlet boundary is set as velocity inlet, the left side of the battery pack model is the inlet of the coolant, the velocity is set as 0.15 m/s, the temperature is 300 K, the coolant is water, and the outlet is set as the pressure outlet, and the outlet pressure is 0pa.The boundary condition of heat exchange between the battery module and the air is set as the thermal convection, and the convection heat exchange coefficient is set to 5 W/(m2-K) [36]. The pressure-based solver is selected and the SIMPLE finite volume method is used for the calculations, and the mass, momentum and energy equations are solved in the second-order windward discrete format. Then the default under-relaxation factor is used, and the size of the under-relaxation factor can be adjusted according to the change of the residual values during the iteration process in order to ensure the iteration accuracy and convergence during the simulation. The other parameters are set by default.
Considering the complex heat transfer process inside the liquid cooling structure of the battery pack, the following assumptions are made in this paper to simplify the calculation:
(a)
The battery core is considered as a volumetric heat source with uniform heat generation.
(b)
The density, specific heat, thermal conductivity and other parameters of the single cell, liquid cooling plate, and coolant do not change with temperature.
(c)
Deformation of the cooling plate due to temperature changes or coolant flow is not considered.
2.5. Grid independence test
In this paper, Meshing software is used to mesh the liquid cooling structure model of the lithium iron phosphate battery pack, the mesh size of the solid domain of the cooling plate is 4 mm, the mesh size of the fluid domain is 2 mm, the mesh size of the solid domain of the battery is 2 mm, the mesh encryption is carried out in the fluid domain with a large influence on the heat transfer. As shown in Fig. 2, the wall of the fluid domain is set up with 3 layers, and the thickness of the first layer is 0.2 mm, and the final model mesh is divided into three layers. The initial number of meshes automatically generated by the software is 3.1 million.

Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of model meshing.

When performing simulation calculations, the size of the mesh has a large impact on the precision and accuracy of the results. The purpose of mesh-independence analysis is to ensure that changes in the existing mesh within a certain range do not have a significant impact on the subsequent simulation results. A common method is to gradually refine the mesh, i.e., to gradually reduce the mesh size and then compare the simulation results at different sizes. The liquid-cooled structure of a lithium iron phosphate battery pack is simulated under different grid sizes, and the effects of grid size on the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack are shown in Fig. 3. The figure compares the effect of six grid numbers on the temperature of the battery pack, the number of grids is 453108, 1146097, 2118948, 3104455, 4398704, and 5748875. The number of grids generated automatically by the software is 450,000, at this time, the quality of the grids is lower, compared with other grids, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery pack change significantly. When the number of grids is increased to 3.1 million, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery module are stabilized at 305.34 K and 4.839 K. Once again, the number of grids is increased significantly, and the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery module change within 1 %, which is a negligible effect of the number of grids on the temperature of the battery module. The time of numerical calculation is closely related to the number of model grids. Increasing the number of model grids will lead to an increase in computation time, and when the number of model grids is increased to a certain level, the computational accuracy will not be significantly improved or the improvement will be slower. Therefore, in this paper, a mesh number of 4.4 million is used for finite element simulation.

2.6. Coolant selection
In a liquid-cooled system, the coolant is one of the key media for transferring heat. The main heat transfer media commonly used in thermal management systems are water, glycerin, ethanol, and 50 % ethylene glycol. The thermophysical parameters of different coolants are shown in Table 2. A comparison of the simulation results of the liquid-cooled structure of lithium battery packs with different coolants is shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Comparison of battery pack temperatures for different coolants.

As can be seen from Fig. 4, the performance of the four coolants in the liquid-cooled structure of the battery pack is relatively good, and the various coolants can control the Tmax of the battery pack within a reasonable temperature range, in which water and 50 % concentration of ethylene glycol solution perform better. From Table 4, it can be seen that water is better than 50 % ethylene glycol solution in terms of various thermophysical parameters, and water also has the advantages of low viscosity, non-toxicity and non-pollution, as well as good thermal stability, etc. However, at low temperatures, it will undergo a phase change and freeze, which may lead to the failure of the thermal management system, and even cause damage to the liquid-cooling flow channel structure. Therefore, the use of water as a liquid-cooled heat transfer medium is not suitable in some environments. Instead, a 50 % ethylene glycol solution is a mixture of water and glycol in equal proportions, with 50 % water and 50 % ethylene glycol. Compared to pure water, glycol solution has a much lower freezing point, which means it will not freeze at low temperatures. Therefore, in some cases, glycol solution can be used as an alternative to liquid-cooled heat transfer media to solve thermal management problems in low-temperature environments. Considering the working environment of the battery pack, 50 % ethylene glycol solution is selected as the liquid-cooled heat exchanger for the battery pack in this paper.

2.7. Comparison of different flow channel and coolant inlet location options
Studies have shown that lower temperature standard deviation and more uniform heat distribution can be obtained by alternating flow directions [37]. In order to investigate the effects of different flow channels and coolant inlet locations on the battery pack thermal management system, four different battery thermal management systems (BTMS) are designed in this subsection, as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Different flow channel and coolant inlet position schemes.

(a) BTMS I (b) BTMS II (c) BTMS III (d) BTMS IV.
The simulation results are derived from the simulation calculations, and the results are analyzed and summarized inductively, and the temperature trends between the battery packs are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 represents the global temperature distribution cloud of BTMS I-IV derived from the simulation. In order to facilitate the observation of the temperature distribution of the overall battery pack, the temperature distribution cloud diagrams are all positive isometric. From the temperature cloud plots and temperature trend graphs of the battery pack, it can be seen that with the change of the coolant inlet and outlet positions, the heat dissipation effect of the battery pack appears to be significantly different. Each scheme corresponds to the resulting Tmax of the battery pack is under 313.15 K. When the direction of the flow channel surround is the same coolant inlet direction is different, the Tmax of the battery pack and the ΔTmax change significantly, the Tmax of the battery pack increases by 0.282 K, while the ΔTmax reduces by 0.711 K. It is worth mentioning that the Tmax of the battery pack is reduced to below 5 K, which makes the whole battery pack's working efficiency and stability have been greatly improved, and ensures the safety of its work. The reason for the change in the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack is that when the inlet position is the same, i.e., on the left side of the battery pack model, with the inflow of coolant, a large amount of coolant with lower temperature is gathered at the inlet position, which can take away a large amount of heat generated by the battery, resulting in a sharp decrease in the temperature of the battery surface on the left side. When the coolant flows from the inlet to the outlet, the increasing temperature of the coolant leads to its decreasing ability to take away the heat from the batteries, so the batteries at the exit position of the battery pack have less heat taken away by the coolant, so that they have the highest temperature of the battery pack, and the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures of the batteries at the right and left sides of the battery pack is the ΔTmax. The inlet staggered program of the coolant inlet location does not gather, so that the battery pack left and right sides of the battery can be through the lower temperature of the coolant to take away the heat so that the highest temperature of the battery pack is in the battery inside, the temperature distribution of the battery pack is more uniform, with a smaller ΔTmax, while the higher temperature of the battery pack inside the battery pack gathered to make the Tmax has risen. When the surround direction of the three flow channels is changed, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery pack change within 0.1 K, which has no obvious effect on the heat dissipation of the battery pack.

Fig. 6. Temperature change trend of BTMS I–IV.

In summary, considering that the Tmax of the four BTMSs is within the range of suitable operating temperatures for batteries, it is necessary to select them according to the temperature uniformity of the battery pack, and the BTMS with staggered coolant inlet direction and the same three-fluid channel surround direction has a greater advantage in terms of temperature uniformity in the battery, so BTMS III is selected as the benchmark BTMS for the subsequent study.
3. Optimization studies
The BTMS III with the lowest maximum temperature difference of the battery pack is used as the initial model for subsequent structural optimization. The different thermophysical properties of different liquid-cooled plate materials affect the thermal performance of BTMS. Changing the flow channel structure and flow channel position can cause changes in the temperature distribution inside the battery pack. The effects of different liquid-cooling plate materials and different flow channel arrangements on the heat dissipation efficiency are analyzed from the liquid-cooling plate material, flow channel height α, and flow channel spacing β. The structural parameters are designed as shown in Fig. 8.

3.1. Influence of different liquid cooling plate materials on thermal performance
The liquid cooling plate in the BTMS has the function of carrying the weight of the battery and holding it in place, and also needs to assume the role of heat exchange with the cooling pipes. In order to ensure the stability of the structure and the heat dissipation effect, metal materials are usually considered as a more suitable choice. Here, the effects of three commonly used metal materials on thermal performance are discussed, namely steel, aluminum, and iron. The thermophysical parameters of different liquid-cooled plate materials are shown in Table 2 In order to understand the effect of these materials on the heat dissipation of the system, it is investigated by conducting simulation experiments under the same thermal boundary conditions.
Fig. 9 shows the global temperature distribution of battery packs with different liquid-cooled plate materials. Fig. 10 shows the trend of maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference of battery packs with different liquid-cooled plate materials. Combined with the temperature cloud and temperature trend graphs, it can be seen that, as a whole, the surface temperature of the battery close to the liquid-cooling pipeline is lower, while the surface temperature of the battery away from the liquid-cooling pipeline is higher. When steel is used as the liquid-cooling plate material, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery pack are the largest, and the Tmax and the ΔTmax reach 307.929 K and 7.104 K. When iron is used as the liquid-cooling plate material, the Tmax and the ΔTmax are 306.396 K and 5.221 K. When aluminum is used as the liquid-cooling plate material, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery pack are the smallest, the Tmax and the ΔTmax are 306.163 K and 4.508 K. It can be seen that there is an obvious correlation between the material of the liquid-cooling plate and the temperature control and temperature uniformity of the battery pack. The reason for the difference between the steel and aluminum plates in terms of heat dissipation ability is that the thermal conductivity of steel is relatively low, and the heat conduction in the steel liquid-cooled plate is slow. In contrast, aluminum plates have a higher thermal conductivity and can conduct heat more quickly from one area to another. In addition, steel is denser than aluminum. The higher the density, the higher the heat capacity per unit volume. As a result, steel liquid-cooled panels dissipate heat at a relatively slower rate, with higher Tmax and ΔTmax, compared to aluminum liquid-cooled panels.

3.2. Influence of different flow channel spacing on thermal performance
Due to the size of the liquid-cooled plate, the adjustment of the spacing of the flow channel is limited. According to the geometry, the distance between the two flow channels is adjusted within the range of 35 mm to 115 mm with an adjustment interval of 20 mm. The simulation results are analyzed and investigated to obtain the influence law of the flow channel position on the thermal performance of the battery pack. Fig. 11 shows the global temperature distribution of the battery pack with different flow channel spacing. Fig. 12 shows the temperature trend of the battery pack with different flow channel spacing.

Fig. 12. Temperature variation trend of the battery pack with different channel spacing.

Combining the temperature cloud and temperature trend graphs, as a whole, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the heat sink system show a clear downward trend during the adjustment of the flow channel spacing from 35 mm to 115 mm. The Tmax and ΔTmax decreased from 306.748 K and 4.896 K to 305.808 K and 4.291 K. It can be seen that there is an obvious correlation between the flow channel spacing and the temperature control and temperature uniformity of the battery pack. The larger the flow channel spacing, the smaller the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack. The Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack decrease because the thermal conductivity of the battery in length and width is much larger than the thermal conductivity of the thickness, resulting in the temperature of the battery ending close to the temperature of the battery cell. When the flow channel spacing is 40 mm, the coolant has less influence on the battery ends, and the heat at both ends of the battery cannot be taken away by the coolant promptly, which increases the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack. In the process of adjusting the flow channel spacing, the distance between the two ends of the battery and the flow channel is continuously shortened, the influence of the flow channel on the two ends of the battery increases, and the Tmax of the battery pack and the ΔTmax gradually decreases.
3.3. Influence of different flow channel widths on thermal performance
Due to the dimensions of the liquid cooling plate, the spacing of the flow channel is limited and the width of the center flow channel is adjusted within a range of 4 mm to 20 mm depending on the geometry. According to the geometry, the width of the middle flow channel is adjusted within the range of 4 mm to 20 mm with an interval of 4 mm. In order to control the total coolant flow into the BTMS, the widths of the upper and lower flow channels should be changed, and the widths of the upper and lower flow channels are equal and the total width of the three flow channels is 30 mm. The results of the simulation are analyzed and the influence of the flow channel position on the thermal performance of the battery pack is obtained. Fig. 13 shows the global temperature distribution of the battery pack with different flow channel widths. Fig. 14 shows the temperature trend of the battery pack with different flow channel widths.

Fig. 14. Temperature variation trend of battery pack with different channel widths.

Combined with the temperature cloud graph and temperature trend graph, as a whole, the Tmax of the heat dissipation system shows an obvious upward trend when the flow channel width is adjusted from 4 mm to 20 mm, and the Tmax rises from 306.023 K to 306.343 K. The ΔTmax has a tendency to decrease and then increase, and it achieves a very small value of 4.435 K when the flow channel width is 16 mm, and an extremely large value of 4.947 K when the flow channel width is 4 mm. It can be seen that there is an obvious correlation between the flow channel width and the temperature control and temperature uniformity of the battery pack. The reason for the increase in the Tmax of the battery pack is that as the width of the flow channel increases, the heat of the battery pools significantly. When the width of the middle flow channel is 4 mm, the width of the upper and lower flow channels is 13 mm, the coolant flow rate of the three flow channels is certain, the flow rate of the upper and lower flow channels is much larger than the flow rate of the middle flow channel, therefore, the highest temperature of the battery pack is in the interior of the battery on the right side, and there is no obvious pooling of battery heat. When the width of the middle flow channel is increased to 20 mm, the width of the upper and lower flow channels is 5 mm, the upper and lower flow channels have a smaller heat dissipation effect for the battery on the left side of the battery pack, while the middle flow channel plays a smaller role in heat dissipation for the battery on the right side of the battery pack at both ends of the battery, so that the batteries with higher temperatures in the middle of the battery pack are pooled to make the ΔTmax of the battery pack rises. The ΔTmax of the battery pack in the flow channel width of 4 mm and 20 mm to achieve a great value is because the coolant inlet position of the coolant temperature is lower, then the coolant can take away more heat generated by the battery, so that the surface temperature of the battery close to the inlet of the coolant and the temperature inside the battery pack to produce a large gap.
3.4. Discrete variable optimization scheme
In this section, OT (orthogonal technology) is used to design the data for discrete variables when designing tests. The OT method can obtain the best design parameters under fewer test conditions. This method can shorten the test time and save a lot of human and financial resources and is often used in scientific research [38,39].
The three levels of liquid-cooled plate materials were steel, aluminum, and iron, the four flow channel spacings were 35, 55, 75, 95, and 115, and the four flow channel widths were 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, and the factors and levels of this orthogonal test are shown in Table 3.
The principle of choosing an orthogonal table is to choose the orthogonal table with a smaller number of experiments if the conditions can be met. 25 groups of experiments in the orthogonal table are calculated using numerical computation software Fluent with discharge multiplicity 2C thermal boundary conditions to get the required evaluation indexes: the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference, as shown in Table 4.
The range analysis method determines the degree of influence of each factor on the evaluation object by calculating the range value of each factor in the test data and combining the best levels of each factor to obtain the optimal parameter combination method. Eq. (8) is the expression for finding the range value [40].

where 
 is the sum of evaluation indicators corresponding to the factors in column 
 and level 
;

The results of the experiment were analyzed by applying the method of range analysis. Firstly, the average value of the maximum temperature corresponding to each factor was obtained, and based on this, the extreme range value corresponding to each factor was calculated. Table 5 shows the results of the range analysis for the Tmax. Table 6 shows the results of the range analysis for the ΔTmax. Plotting the range analysis histograms for each factor according to the range analysis table provides a more intuitive picture of the degree of influence of each factor on the target value. Fig. 15 shows the range analysis histogram.

Fig. 15. Histogram of range values.

From the range analysis histogram, it can be visualized that the degree of influence of each factor on the Tmax of the battery cooling system group, in descending order, is as follows: B (flow channel spacing), A (liquid-cooling plate material), C (flow channel width). The degree of influence of each factor on the ΔTmax of the battery cooling system group is, in descending order, A (liquid cooling plate material), B (flow channel spacing), and C (flow channel width). Adjusting the flow channel spacing had the most significant effect on improving the Tmax. The flow channel width had the least degree of effect on the Tmax. Liquid cooling plate material has the most significant effect on improving the ΔTmax. Flow channel width had the least effect on the ΔTmax.
Based on the values of the assessment indexes for each factor level, their impact on the effectiveness of the test was determined. Fig. 16 shows the relationship between the levels and the evaluation indexes. The most significant level of each factor can be obtained through the correspondence between the levels and evaluation indexes in Fig. 16, and the optimal level and optimal combination of structural parameters for each factor are shown in Table 7.

The distribution of battery pack temperature under the optimal combination of factor levels is calculated by simulation. Fig. 17 shows the comparison graph of the temperature distribution of the thermal system before and after orthogonal optimization, and the specific temperature data are shown in Table 8. Compared with the structure before optimization, the Tmax of the optimal thermal management system of the battery pack obtained by the extreme difference analysis method decreased by 0.274 K, and the ΔTmax decreased by 0.315 K. The temperature consistency and performance of the heat dissipation system have been greatly improved, which makes the efficiency and stability of the whole battery pack greatly improved and ensures the safety of its work.

3.5. Continuous variable optimization scheme
In this section, the structural parameters are considered as continuous variables, and the Latin hypercube sampling method is used to select the test points and simulate them separately. The response surface approximation models of continuous random variables and the target values are constructed by analyzing the simulation results, and their optimal values are obtained by using the multi-islands genetic algorithm (MGA).
Through the discrete variable optimization scheme in the previous section, the Tmax of the battery pack has been reduced to below the target temperature of 7.4 K, while the ΔTmax of the battery pack is only below the target temperature of 0.8 K. Therefore, the ΔTmax of the battery pack is selected as the optimization objective in this section. According to the single-factor analysis and discrete variable optimization scheme, it is known that the liquid-cooling plate material, flow channel spacing and flow channel width are the main factors affecting the ΔTmax of the battery pack, while the liquid-cooled plate material cannot be optimized as a continuous type variable, and in this section, the flow channel spacing and the flow channel width will be selected as the optimized design variables. At the same time, the minimum design range where the optimal structure is located and the dimensional limitations to be considered in the arrangement of liquid cooling plate derived from the discrete variable optimization scheme in the previous section are used as the constraints, and the value ranges of each design variable are shown in Table 9.
Table 9. Upper and lower limits of parameters.

Parameters	Flow channel spacing (mm)	Flow channel width (mm)
Upper limit	115	20
Lower limit	95	12
The Latin hypercube sampling method is an approximate random sampling method with multiple parameters. The experimental design was carried out by Latin hypercube, and the value ranges of the two variables were normalized to facilitate the establishment of the subsequent response surface approximation model, and 30 sample points in the design space were obtained. The sample points extracted from the experimental design were brought into Fluent for the numerical calculation to obtain the ΔTmax of the battery pack, and the design variables and optimization target data were sorted out as shown in Table 10. This table will be used as the basis for subsequent construction of the response surface approximation model.
The response surface approximation model uses a polynomial function to approximate the relationship between the design variables and the objective function, which is simpler to compute, and there is no need for complex mathematical operations or parameter optimization processes when constructing and using the response surface model, which is fitted by the Isight software with the following function expression.
(9)
The mean error, maximum error, root mean square error, and error in the coefficient of determination R2 for the response surface model obtained by Isight are shown in Table 11. The error scatter is shown in Fig. 18. Analyzing the error plots and the values of each error term, this approximate model meets the design requirements.

The relationship between ×1, ×2, and the target value y1 can be observed in the approximate model visualization, as shown in Fig. 19. The corresponding data were exported, and the response surface curves of each response surface were plotted using the origin software as shown in Fig. 20. Observing the trend plot of the relationship between each variable and the target value, the ΔTmax of the battery pack shows an overall decreasing trend as the flow channel spacing gradually increases. As the flow channel width gradually increases, the ΔTmax of the battery pack first decreases and then increases. Observing the response surface curve, according to the range of the ΔTmax corresponding to each factor, it can be seen that the degree of influence of each factor on the ΔTmax of the battery pack in descending order is as follows: flow channel width x2, flow channel spacing x1, which is inconsistent with the order of the degree of influence derived from the analysis of the extreme deviation above, the reason for this is that the range of values of the flow channel width variable of the continuous variable optimization scheme is one-half of that of the discrete variable optimization scheme, and the range of values of the flow channel spacing variable is one-half of that of the original scheme. The reason is that the continuous variable optimization scheme has one-half of the value range of the flow channel width variable and one-quarter of the original value range of the flow channel spacing variable, and the narrowing of the value range of the flow channel spacing variable is much larger than the narrowing of the value range of the flow channel width variable, which makes the influence of the flow channel spacing variable on the battery pack lower than that of the flow channel width variable within the range of values of the variable in this case.

Constructing a multi-island genetic algorithm model using Isight software. Multi-island genetic algorithm is a parallel genetic algorithm based on population grouping. Its advantages are as follows: migration between different subpopulations can effectively maintain the diversity of the population and avoid falling into the local optimal solution; The parallel search of multiple subpopulations increases the ability of global search and improves the possibility of finding the global optimal solution [41]. After optimization iterations, the optimal solution is obtained. The optimization results of multi-island genetic algorithm, simulation results and polar analysis optimization results are shown in Table 12.

The simulation results show that the ΔTmax of the battery is 4.168 K, and the error is within 5 % of the predicted value of 4.182 K. In the optimized battery pack model, compared with the optimization result of extreme variance analysis, the ΔTmax decreased by 0.04 K. The temperature uniformity of the optimized battery pack is improved.
The structural parameters are rounded to reduce the processing difficulty, and the rounded structural parameters are: flow channel spacing of 115 mm and flow channel width of 15 mm. Fig. 21 shows the comparison of the heat dissipation temperature distribution between the initial structure and the final optimized structure, and the specific temperature data are shown in Table 13. According to Table 16, after the optimization of discrete and continuous variables, the Tmax of the system is reduced by 0.274 K, and the ΔTmax is reduced by 0.338 K. This battery pack is the optimal battery pack derived from the research of this paper, which will be used in the subsequent research of energy saving strategies.

4. Energy saving strategy
4.1. Effect of coolant temperature and flow rate
The heat generated by the liquid-cooled battery thermal management system in the working process is mainly conducted to the coolant through the liquid-cooled plate, and the flow of the coolant will then take away the heat from the battery module, realizing the liquid cooling of the battery module. After determining the flow channel structure of the coolant, this section further optimizes the heat dissipation performance of the liquid-cooled battery thermal management system by studying the effects of the inlet temperature and flow rate of the coolant on the battery module.
The coolant temperatures at 273 K, 282 K, 291 K, 300 K, and 309 K are simulated and analyzed. Fig. 22 shows the temperature trends for battery packs with different coolant temperatures. From the above distribution of temperature trends at five different coolant inlet temperature. With the decrease of the coolant inlet temperature, the maximum temperature of the battery module is getting lower and lower, and the cooling performance is better performance becomes better. However, the lowest temperature is also the lowest, which means the lower the coolant inlet temperature, the larger the temperature difference of the battery module, and when the coolant temperature is lower than 300 K, the temperature of the battery module is lower than the lower limit of the suitable temperature range 298.15 K.

The coolant inlet flow rates at 0.05 m/s, 0.1 m/s, 0.15 m/s, 0.2 m/s, and 0.25 m/s are simulated and analyzed. Fig. 23 shows the temperature trend of the battery pack for different coolant flow rates. It can be seen that different coolant flow rates have a very large impact on the temperature of the battery pack. The increase of the inlet flow rate enhances the convective heat transfer between the coolant and the liquid-cooled plate, and the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference of the battery system decrease with the increase of the flow rate; however, the decreasing trend of the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference of the battery pack slows down gradually, and the decrease decreases.

4.2. Effect of ambient temperature
Harsh environmental conditions will have an impact on the thermal characteristics of the battery thermal management system. The heat production of the battery system will increase in high temperature environments, while the capacity and performance of the battery system will rapidly degrade in low temperature environments. Keep the coolant temperature at 300 K and the inlet flow rate at 0.15 m/s. The ambient temperatures at 273 K, 282 K, 291 K, 300 K, and 309 K are simulated and analyzed.
Fig. 24 shows the comparison of battery pack temperatures at different ambient temperatures. It can be seen that different ambient temperatures affect the temperature of the battery pack. As the ambient temperature increases, the Tmax of the battery system also increases, this is due to the initial temperature of the battery system being consistent with the ambient temperature, higher initial temperature increases the difficulty of heat dissipation of the battery system, the ΔTmax of the battery system change trend is similar to the Tmax overall. It is worth noting that, as the ambient temperature continues to rise, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery module are gradually increasing, the Tmax from 304.456 K to 306.337 K, the ΔTmax from 3.357 K to 4.459 K, are not more than the battery suitable for the working environment temperature of 313.15 K and the ΔTmax of 5 K.

4.3. Coolant temperature and flow rate control
When electric vehicles are used at different moments without using seasons, they face changes in the ambient temperature and the operating temperature of the battery pack also changes. Based on the effects of ambient temperature, coolant flow rate and temperature on the temperature of the battery pack studied in the previous two sections, the Tmax and the ΔTmax of the battery pack at different ambient temperatures are within the range of suitable operating temperatures for the battery thermal management system. When the coolant flow rate is 0.05 m/s, the Tmax of the battery pack is close to 313.15 K, and the ΔTmax exceeds the suitable Tmax by 2.262 K. Therefore, in this section, by controlling the temperature of the coolant to stabilize at 300 K and adjusting the flow rate of the coolant, the ΔTmax of the battery pack is not exceeding the suitable ΔTmax by 5 K and is close to 4.9 K, to realize energy-saving control.
Taking the ambient temperature of 25 °C (298.15 K) as an example, the coolant flow rate is controlled to be 0.08 m/s, 0.09 m/s, 0.1 m/s, 0.11 m/s, 0.12 m/s, respectively, and the initial temperature of the battery module and the ambient temperature is 298.15 K, and the temperature of the coolant is 300 K. The simulation results are shown in Table 14.

When the coolant flow rate is 0.10154 m/s, the ΔTmax of the battery pack is 4.886 K, which is close to the target ΔTmax of 4.9 K, and the error is within 5 %. The coolant flow rate is adjusted from 0.15 m/s to 0.10154 m/s, which reduces 32.31 % and realizes energy-saving control.
Integrate the temperature of a location in Asia in 2023, adjust the coolant flow rate, and plot the coolant flow rate control surface as shown in Fig. 25. From the coolant flow rate control surface, it can be seen that the maximum flow rate distribution in a day is around fourteen o'clock, the flow rate change trend from January to December is increasing and then decreasing, and the coolant flow rate is lower than the initial flow rate value of 0.15 m/s. Assuming uninterrupted use of the electric vehicle, the volume of the surface is calculated by using the interpolation method, and the surface volume is 26.8411. With the initial coolant flow rate of 0.15 m/s, the surface volume is calculated as rectangular volume, the rectangular volume is 43.2. Calculate the energy-saving efficiency by Eq. (11). Under the premise of ensuring the safety and reliability of the power battery, the energy consumption of the liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery thermal management system is drastically reduced by 37.87 % through the regulation of the coolant flow rate.

5. Conclusions
(1)
In this paper, a liquid-cooled battery thermal management system consisting of twelve 50 Ah lithium iron phosphate batteries is designed, meshed, and boundary conditioned. A similar mesh with 4.4 million meshes was selected for subsequent finite element simulation through mesh-independence analysis.
(2)
Comparing the effects of different cooling media on the temperature of the battery pack, 50 % ethylene glycol solution was selected as the liquid-cooled heat transfer medium for the battery pack.
(3)
Comparing the four different flow paths and coolant inlet locations, BTMS III with a maximum temperature difference of 4.508 K has the best heat dissipation performance, and therefore this battery thermal management system is chosen as the benchmark model for the subsequent optimization study.
(4)
The effects of liquid-cooled plate material, flow channel spacing, and flow channel width on battery pack temperature are discussed separately. Through the discrete variable optimization scheme and continuous variable optimization scheme, the maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference of the battery thermal management system were reduced by 0.274 K and 0.335 K compared with the battery thermal management system before optimization.
(5)
Finally, the effects of ambient temperature, coolant temperature, and flow rate on the temperature of the battery pack were analyzed. It is determined that the coolant temperature should be controlled at 300. The most energy-efficient coolant flow rate was solved by fitting a quadratic equation between the coolant flow rate and the maximum temperature difference. The coolant flow rate control surface is plotted, and the energy consumption of the liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery thermal management system is calculated to be drastically reduced by 37.87 %, realizing energy-saving control.
