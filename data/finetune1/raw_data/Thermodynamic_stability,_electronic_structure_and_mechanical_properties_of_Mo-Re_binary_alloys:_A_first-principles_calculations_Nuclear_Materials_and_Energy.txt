Abstract
Using first-principles calculations, we have systematically studied thermodynamic stability, electronic structure and mechanical properties of Mo-Re binary alloys. The alloying element Re prefers to occupy the substitution position with a formation energy of 0.10 eV in Mo rather than the tetrahedron/octahedron interstitial position. The charge transfers are obviously present between Re and Mo atoms, which can be confirmed by the Bader charge analysis. The density of states (DOS) demonstrates that the d orbitals of Re and Mo atoms are hybridized, revealing that Re and its adjacent Mo atoms can form the directional bond containing covalent components. On the basis of above studies on the most stable occupancy structure, the mechanical quantities (the elastic constants Cij, bulk modulus B, Young’s modulus E, shear modulus G, Poisson’s ratio v, and B/G) have been analyzed for three Mo-Re alloys with the low Re content, which are Mo127Re1, Mo53Re1 and Mo15Re1, respectively. All these mechanical quantities of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are nearly the same as that of perfect Mo, while all these mechanical quantities of Mo15Re1 alloy are obviously larger or smaller than that of perfect Mo. This demonstrates that Mo15Re1 alloy has significantly different mechanical characteristics from Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys as well as perfect Mo. These results can provide a significant reference for the application of Mo-Re alloys in future fusion fields.

1. Introduction
It is well known that the refractory metal, molybdenum (Mo), not only has excellent thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance but also exhibits a low thermal expansion coefficient, high hardness, good high-temperature strength, and low sputtering erosion. Due to these advantages, Mo material has been generally applied to the nuclear industry. For example in nuclear fusion, Mo mirrors will be used for optical diagnostics in order to control the plasma in the Tokamak of ITER [1], [2], [3]. Meanwhile, Mo mirrors must suffer the transient temperature increment in the Tokamak. Therefore, obtaining the basic properties of Mo material can help us well operate the optical systems in Tokamak. However, pure Mo is relatively brittle at room temperature, with poor processing performance, poor welding performance, easy oxidation, and recrystallization brittleness. All these factors limit the application of pure Mo in the fusion Tokamak. Adding a certain amount of alloying elements (such as C, B, Si, Al, Re, and rare earth elements) to metallic Mo is an effective method to improve these properties of pure Mo.
Rhenium (Re) is a typical alloying element, which has been applied to metallic Mo to form a Mo-Re binary alloy. The addition of Re can reduce the ductile–brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of pure Mo and increase its recrystallization temperature, resulting in better strength, plasticity, and mechanical properties of metallic Mo. This phenomenon is called as the effect of Rhenium. Especially, as a highly potential cladding material in fission reactors, the irradiation properties of Mo-Re alloy is particularly important [4]. In nuclear fusion reactors, understanding and predicting the long-term service performance of metal-alloys applied in optical diagnostics depends on phase stability and micro-structural changes [5]. The radiation hardening and mechanical property degradation of Mo-Re alloys under irradiation environment are generally related to two kinds of phenomenons, the radiation-induced defects and radiation precipitation.
The radiation-induced defects include point defects, dislocation loops, voids and the interaction between them. In general, the degree of radiation hardening in Mo-Re alloys from radiation-induced defects are related to the Re content, irradiation temperature, and so on. At radiation damage around 20 dpa, Nemoto et al. [6] systematically studied the hardness changes of Mo-Re alloys with different Re contents in the irradiation environment with the temperature range of 681–1072 K, and the results show that the hardness of Mo-Re alloy increases with the increase of Re content. Fabritsiev et al. [7] studied the mechanical properties with different Re contents and irradiation temperatures, and the results also indicate that Mo-Re alloy exhibits a significant decrease in plasticity under low-temperature irradiation and may be accompanied by more severe grain boundary fractures. Through in-situ observation experiments and molecular dynamics simulation, Li et al. [8], [9] performed a detailed investigation on the formation mechanism and properties of dislocation loops in the Mo-based alloys under the irradiation environment, such as nucleation, annihilation, merging, size changes, and so on. The results show the volume number density and size of dislocation loops are influenced by the temperature, material thickness, and flux simultaneously.
The radiation precipitation origins from the element segregation caused by the interaction among defects, solute atoms, and defect traps, which further exceed the solid solubility to form precipitated phases. There are two mechanisms in the process of radiation precipitation: radiation-enhanced precipitation (REP) and radiation-induced precipitation (RIP). REP accelerates the evolution of precipitation to an equilibrium state through irradiation, which only occurs in supersaturated alloys [10]. Based on the Mo-Re phase diagram, when the temperature is less than 2773 K and the amount of Re is <25 %, Re atoms are in a solid solution state in Mo [11]. Many researches have indicated that Mo-Re alloy follow the RIP process and produce uniformly distributed Re-based phases under irradiation environment, which causes hardening and embrittlement [12], [13].
Besides, Researchers also have conducted extensive studies on the on the manufacture process of Mo-Re binary alloys. For instance, Zeng et al. [14] compared the effects of co-reduction processes of different Mo oxides and NH4ReO4 on the size distribution and phase composition of Mo-10Re pre-alloyed powders. The results indicate that MoO3 as a precursor oxide is beneficial for achieving uniform mixing of Mo and Re elements at the atomic scale and forming separate Mo (Re) solid solutions. These research results have very important guiding significance for the development of high-performance Mo-Re alloy powders.
However, there is currently a lack of simulation research on the various properties of specific Mo-Re alloys, and most simulation studies are conducted on other composite element in Mo-based alloys. Zhang et al. focuses on the first-principles calculations of the elastic moduli of Mo-Ti based alloys using a cluster-plus-glue-atom model for stable solid solutions [15]. Li et al. use an all-electron exact muffin-tin orbitals (EMTO) method combined with coherent potential approximation (CPA) to calculate the ideal tensile strength (ITS) of Tc-Mo alloys from first-principles calculations [16]. Aryali et al. study the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of Mo-based alloys (the Mo-Si-B model system) by using first-principles calculations [17]. By using first-principles density functional theory method (DFT), Zhang et al. calculate the lattice stability of oxide compounds in the Mo-O system to study the oxidation resistance in Mo-based alloys [18]. Liu et al. investigate the effect on the microstructural characteristics with addition of Mo in the Ni-Mo-Re alloys [19]. Liu et al. study the electronic structure and magnetism of the Mo-based alloys with addition Si, Ge and Sn by using the DFT calculation [20]. Hutter et al. focuses on the prediction of thermodynamic properties of Mo-Si-B alloys using first-principles calculations [21]. The method involves computing elastic properties and fitting a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state to solve the Debye model. Yang et al. investigates the detailed physical analysis of the interaction between transition elements (3d, 4d, and 5d) and point defects in Mo-based alloys for nuclear material applications [22]. Yang et al. study the effect of alloying elements on the elastic properties of Ti-Mo based alloys by the DFT calculation [23]. Liu et al. further studied the interaction of transition elements (TEs) with hydrogen in interstitial and vacancy position in Mo crystal by using first-principles simulation [24]. The segregation behavior of carbon and oxygen at molybdenum grain boundaries and their influence on grain boundary properties were studied using first-principles methods was studied by Wang et al. [25]. Yang et al. investigate the effects of different proportions and temperatures on the mechanical properties of Mo-Re alloys by using first-principles calculations and machine learning potential functions [26].
As mentioned above, these studies are chiefly limited to the experimental work on Mo-Re alloys and calculation studies on Mo-based alloys without Re. Till now, the geometric configuration, thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of the alloying element Re in Mo and the influence of Re on the fundamental mechanical properties of Mo have not been researched in detail using the computational simulation method. This seriously affects the application of Mo-Re alloy in the field of optical diagnostics in the fusion Tokamak [1], [2], [3]. For this reason, we have carried out the first-principles calculations for thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of Re in Mo as well as the influence from the concentration of Re on the fundamental mechanical properties of Mo. These calculated results will provide a guiding opinion for the design of the alloying element Re composition in Mo, which further gives a useful reference and a database for the performance and lifetime evaluation of Mo-Re alloy for the optical diagnostics in future nuclear fusion Tokamak.
2. Methods
Based on density functional theory (DFT), the first-principles calculations were carried out using the pseudopotential plane wave as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [27], [28]. The electronic exchange–correlation energy is treated using the generalized gradient approximations (GGA) schemes of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [29], [30], [31]. The 5s4p4d and 6s5p5d electrons were treated as valence electrons for Mo and Re, and the ionic cores were represented by the projector augmented wave potentials [32], [33]. The convergence tests have been strictly performed for the total energy with respect to the energy cutoff, and 350 eV is sufficient for the total energy and geometry of the Mo supercell with and without the alloying element Re. Therefore, the energy cutoff of 350 eV is presently employed. As shown in Fig. 1, we used the 128-atom supercell containing (4 × 4 × 4) unit cells with lengths of 12.64 Å in the [1 0 0], [0 1 0], and [0 0 1] directions, respectively. The Mo single-crystal belongs to body centered cubic (bcc) configuration, and the calculated equilibrium lattice constant is 3.16 Å, in good agreement with the experimental result of 3.15 Å [34]. The Brillouin zone of the supercell was sampled with the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [35] using a (3 × 3 × 3) k-points mesh. The Methfessel-Paxton [36] smearing method was used to integrate the Brillouin zone and account for partial occupancy of the metals near the Fermi level with a smearing width of 0.1 eV. During the geometry optimization, the supercell size and atomic positions are relaxed to equilibrium. The convergence accuracy of inter-atomic forces and total energy is 10−3 eVÅ−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Intrinsic point defects in Mo
To demonstrate the accuracy of the current research, we first calculated the formation energies of intrinsic defects in Mo. As shown in Table 1, the current calculations show that the vacancy formation energy is 2.68 eV, in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.70 eV [37] gained using the resistivity method. We further calculated the formation energy of self-interstitial atom at tetrahedron/octahedron interstitial position and found that the formation energies were 8.02 and 8.65 eV for tetrahedron and octahedron positions, respectively. As clearly seen from Table 1, the present results are slightly higher or lower than those of previous experiments and calculations however basically in agreement with each other.

3.2. The alloying element Re in Mo
3.2.1. Stability and formation energy of alloying element Re in Mo
By calculating the formation energies using Eqs. (2), (3), we next study the structural stability of Re at tetrahedron/octahedron interstitial position and substitution position, as shown in Fig. 2. The formation energies are 7.93 and 8.73 eV for Re at tetrahedron and octahedron interstitial positions, respectively. Despite the formation energy of tetrahedron-Re is lower than that of octahedron-Re, both two energies are found to be much higher and endothermic in bulk Mo. So large formation energies stem mainly from that both tetrahedron and octahedron interstitial positions are too small to have a capacity to accommodating a Re atom. Generally, the substitution position should be a favorable position for a Re atom because it exhibits a large volume space. Really, a much lower formation energy of 0.10 eV is present for Re at the substitution position. This demonstrates that the alloying element Re prefers to stay at the substitution position in comparison with the tetrahedron/octahedron interstitial position in Mo.

3.2.2. Charge density
In order to understand the interaction between interstitial/substitution Re and its first nearest neighbor (1NN) Mo atoms, we give the charge density distributions for Re at substitution and two interstitial positions, as shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5. It can be seen from Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5(a) that the electrons in the blue region are in a delocalized state, while the green and red regions are in a free electron gas state and localized state, respectively. For Re at tetrahedron and octahedron interstitial positions, both green and red regions between Re and its 1NN Mo atoms are larger than that at the substitution position. In general, the larger the region of free electron gas state and localized state, the higher the system energy. Accordingly, the alloying structure with Re in substitution position is more stable since it has a larger region of delocalization compared with Re in both interstitial positions. Therefore, the substitution-Re has the lowest formation energy.

The differential charge densities are retrieved as shown Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 (b)(c), in which (b) is the 3D differential charge density and (c) is the 2D differential charge density in the plane determined by Re and 1NN Mo atoms. It is clear to note from these three alloying structures that the charge transfers are present between Re and Mo atoms, and the charges around the Re atom are creased after the formation of the Mo-Re alloy system. The Bader charge method can simply characterize the charge transfer between atoms according to Atom in Molecule (AIM) theory [41] with a grid-based algorithm [42], [43]. In this method, the real-space can be divided into several sub-spaces related to each atom, according to the charge density distribution. The Bader charge can divide the number of electrons per atom based on the surface with a charge density gradient of zero [44]. The integrated charge can be seen as a good approximate value of atomic charge. Using this method, we quantitatively calculated the total charges and Bader charges of Re and its 1NN/2NN Mo atoms, as listed in Table 2. At the same time, Fig. 6 gives the Bader charges for the Re at substitution position, tetrahedron interstitial position and octahedron interstitial position, respectively.

Fig. 6. The Bader charge for Re at (a) substitution position, (b) tetrahedron interstitial position, and (c) octahedron interstitial position, respectively.

For Re at substitution, tetrahedron and octahedron, the total charges are 7.67 e, 7.62 e and 7.64 e, respectively. The well-known valence electrons of the Re atom is 7.00 e, which means that the Re atom obtains the electrons from the adjacent Mo atoms and becomes negatively charged for all three configurations. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 6, the Bader charges are −0.67 e, −0.62 e and −0.64 e for Re at substitution, tetrahedron and octahedron, respectively. For the situation of substitution-Re, the total charges are 5.94 e and 5.97 e of 1NN and 2NN Mo atoms, respectively. These two values are lower than the number of valence electrons (6.00 e) of the Mo atom, suggesting that both the 1NN and 2NN Mo atoms lose electrons and become positively charged. Therefore, the Bader charge is + 0.06/+0.03 e for 1NN/2NN Mo atoms, while the Bader charge is found to become almost zero for the 3NN Mo atoms (Table 2 does not give the corresponding values here). This indicates that the interaction between substitution-Re and Mo can be only limited to the 2NN shell layer. For the tetrahedron-Re case, the total charge of 1NN/2NN Mo atoms is 6.06/5.94 e, and the corresponding Bader charge is −0.06/+0.06 e. This indicates that the tetrahedron-Re can interact with both 1NN and 2NN Mo atoms. For the octahedron-Re case, the Bader charges of 1NN and 2NN Mo atoms are −0.02 e and 0, respectively. This result hints the octahedron-Re interacts mainly with 1NN Mo atoms.
3.2.3. Density of states
The density of states (DOS) reveals the distribution of electrons in a certain energy range. According to the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis, the bond interaction between Re and host Mo atoms can be well described. Here we have calculated the total density of states (TDOS) and PDOS of the Mo-Re system. Fig. 7 shows the TDOS of Re at different positions in the Mo system. As shown in Fig. 7, the TDOS for all three situations are higher than zero near the Fermi level, which means all of them are conductive metals. At the Fermi level, the TDOS of the Mo-Re alloy system is mainly provided by the electrons from the d orbitals of Re and Mo atoms, while the contributions from the p orbitals and s orbitals are very small. We can further find that the d orbitals of Re and Mo atoms are hybridized, indicating that Re and its neighboring Mo atoms can form a strongly directional bond.

The top plot is the TDOS for total atoms in the Mo-Re supercell system, the middle plot is the PDOS for all Mo atoms in the Mo-Re supercell system, and the bottom plot is the PDOS for the Re atom in the Mo-Re supercell system.

We also give the DOS of Re and its 1NN Mo atoms, as shown in Fig. 8. If the DOS of two atoms close in space has overlapping peaks in some energy range, then two atoms will form directional bonds. It is obvious from Fig. 6(a)–(c) that there are some overlapping peaks in DOS, which means the bonding interactions are really present between Re and its 1NN Mo atoms, consistent with the above conclusion of charge density analysis.

3.3. Mechanical properties
Based on the study above, the Re in substitution position is more stable compared with the interstitial position. Here we further investigate the mechanical properties with different concentrations of Re in Mo-Re alloys, in which Re atom is located at the substitution position. Mo127Re1(4 × 4 × 4 supercell with 127 Mo atoms and 1 Re), Mo53Re1(3 × 3 × 3 supercell with 53 Mo atoms and 1 Re), and Mo15Re1(2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 15 Mo atoms and 1 Re) are studied on the mechanical properties.
3.3.1. Calculation details
The elastic properties of single-crystal Mo-Re binary alloys can be established by the elastic constant Cij (i.e., the flexibility constant). Single-crystal Mo-Re alloy has three independent elastic constants (C11, C12 and C44) because it belongs to a bcc structure. It is well known that the elastic constant is proportional to the second-order coefficients in Hermitian polynomials. We can derive the elastic constant from energy changes by applying small strains to the equilibrium lattice structure [45]. To obtain the elastic constants of bcc Mo-Re binary alloy, we used three strain modes and the corresponding non-zero strains, as follows: (1) ε11 = δ; (2) ε11 = ε22 = ε33 = δ; (3) ε12 = ε21 = ε13 = ε31 = ε23 = ε32 = δ/2. Based on the strain equation 
(
 denotes strain matrix 
), we can therefore obtain the elastic constants. For different Re concentrations in Mo-Re binary alloy, we use a 128/54/16-atom supercell including one Re atom to calculate the elastic constants. To get accurate elastic constant values, 1000 k-points, 2197 k-points, and 8000 k-points were applied to 128-atom supercell, 54-atom supercell, and 16-atom supercell, respectively.

(10)
For cubic single-crystals, the elastic constants of different crystal directions can determine Young’s modulus and shear modulus [46], which have been derived in previous work [47]. In different crystal orientations, the Young’s modulus can be given as
(11)
(12)
(13)
In bcc Mo-Re single-crystal, {2 1 1} 〈1 1 1〉 and {1 1 0} 〈1 1 1〉 are the main two slip systems, in which two shear moduli are exactly equal at a small strain limit, and the corresponding expression is written as
(14)
In fact, the elastic constants can only reveal the properties of single-crystals at the micro level, so they cannot provide validly the mechanical properties of poly-crystal materials in reality. With that in mind, we must study mechanical quantities of poly-crystal Mo-Re alloy, i.e., bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio v. According to Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation [48], [49], bulk modulus B and shear modulus G of poly-crystal Mo-Re alloy are obtained using the following formulas. The bulk modulus B is first given as

3.3.2. Mechanical quantities of single-crystal Mo-Re binary alloy
Fig. 9 displays the elastic constants (Cij) of single-crystal Mo-Re binary alloy with the increment of Re concentration, and simultaneously Table 3 lists the specific calculated values. It is obvious that Re has more influence on C11 than on both C12 and C44 with the increasing Re concentration. The C11 changes from 483.661 GPa of Mo127Re1 alloy to 517.008 GPa of Mo15Re1 alloy and the difference-value (D-value) between Mo127Re1 and Mo15Re1 alloy is equal to 33.347 GPa, suggesting that the C11 depends obviously on the Re content in Mo-Re alloy. In comparison with the C11 case, the D-value for C12 (C44) is equal to 12.519 (10.319) GPa between Mo127Re1 and Mo15Re1 alloy, demonstrating that both C12 and C44 rely weakly on the Re content. The mechanical stability of W-Cr alloys can be described according to the elastic constants. The mechanical stability of cubic crystal systems obeys the following criteria: C11 > 0, (C11-C12) > 0, (C11 + 2C12) > 0 and C44 > 0 [50]. Apparently, all these Mo-Re alloys meet this criterion and are mechanically stable, as shown in Table 3.

*For the values of reference work, most of them only include the C11, C12, C44, so we compute the values of E〈1 0 0〉, E〈1 1 0〉, E〈1 1 1〉, and G〈1 1 1〉 based on the Eqs. (11)–(14).
The C11 can be broadly applied to reveal the stiffness of Mo-Re alloy. As seen in Fig. 9, the elastic constants C11 of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are basically consistent with that of perfect Mo, while the elastic constant C11 of Mo15Re1 alloy is significantly higher than that of perfect Mo, which suggests that the stiffness of perfect Mo can be improved by adding a certain content of alloying element Re. As listed in Table 3, the elastic constants C11 for Mo-Re binary alloys obey the following order: Mo127Re1 < Mo53Re1 < Mo15Re1, meaning that Mo15Re1 binary alloy exhibits the strongest stiffness among three Mo-Re alloys.
The elastic constant C12 is usually employed to access the ability to resist transverse deformation of one alloy-material. As shown in Fig. 9, the elastic constants C12 of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are also basically consistent with that of perfect Mo, while the elastic constant C12 of Mo15Re1 alloy is slightly lower than that of perfect Mo, demonstrating that doping the alloying element Re can reduce the ability of perfect Mo to resist the transverse deformation. As listed in Table 3, the elastic constants C12 for Mo-Re binary alloys obey the order below: Mo127Re1 > Mo53Re1 > Mo15Re1, suggesting that Mo127Re1 binary alloy has the most extraordinary ability to resist the transverse deformation among three Mo-Re alloys.
Fig. 10 displays Young’s/shear modulus of Mo-Re binary alloy with the increment of Re content. In three directions, the Young’s modulus displays the same variation pattern, i.e., the Young’s moduli of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are the same as that of perfect Mo, while the Young’s modulus of Mo15Re1 alloy is significantly higher than that of perfect Mo. This suggests that at the same tensile strain, the required tensile stress of Mo15Re1 alloy is higher than that of perfect Mo, and thus Mo15Re1 alloy can improve the ability of resisting tension/compression, compared with perfect Mo. Young’s modulus is also used for assessing the stiffness of one alloy. Usually, the greater the Young’s modulus is, the greater the stiffness of the alloy is [54]. Therefore, Mo15Re1 alloy exhibits the highest stiffness among these three alloys. As shown in Fig. 10, there is a similar changing tendency in shear modulus as Young’s modulus, i.e., the shear moduli of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are the same as that of perfect Mo, while the shear modulus of Mo15Re1 alloy is obviously higher than that of perfect Mo. The shear modulus can reveal the resistance to shear deformation of one alloy, which reflects the hardness of one alloy to some extent. Usually, the higher the shear modulus is, the higher the hardness of one alloy is. So, Mo15Re1 alloy has the highest hardness among these three alloys as well as perfect Mo.

3.3.3. Mechanical quantities of poly-crystal Mo-Re binary alloy
For poly-crystal Mo-Re binary alloy, Fig. 11 shows the variation trends of bulk modulus B, Young’s modulus E and shear modulus G. Table 4 lists the specific calculated results. Similar to the changing tendency of single crystal modulus, the poly-crystal moduli (including B, E and G) of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are the same as those of perfect Mo, while the poly-crystal modulus of Mo15Re1 alloy is slightly higher than that of perfect Mo. The bulk modulus B reflects the difficulty of deformation of a material under uniform acting force [55], and the larger the bulk modulus B, the stronger the incompressibility of the material. For the situations of Young’s modulus E and shear modulus G, similar analyses exist for single-crystals and poly-crystals, which will not be repeated here.

*For the values of reference work, most of them only include the C11, C12, C44, so we compute the values of B, E, G, ν, and B/G based on the Eqs. (15)–(18).
Fig. 12 shows the value of B/G and Poisson’s ratio (ν). In terms of the Pugh criterion [56], the value of B/G is usually used to evaluate the ductility or brittleness of a material. If the B/G value ≥ 1.75, the material is in the ductile region; if the B/G value ≤ 1.75, the material is in the brittle region. As listed in Table 4, the values of B/G for all poly-crystal Mo-Re alloys are higher than 1.75, suggesting that these Mo-Re alloys are in the ductile phase. At the same time, the poly-crystal values of B/G for both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are almost identical to those of perfect Mo, while the poly-crystal value of B/G for Mo15Re1 alloy is obviously lower than that of perfect Mo. This demonstrates that the poly-crystal Mo15Re1 alloy exhibits the worst ductility among these three Mo-Re alloys.

Fig. 12. The B/G and Poisson’s ratio (ν) of poly-crystal Mo-Re binary alloy.

Poisson’s ratio is usually used to reveal the plasticity of a material. Perfect plasticity is good for the machinability of material. As shown in Table 4, the changing trend of Poisson’s ratio is consistent with that of B/G. Mo53Re1 alloy has the largest value of 0.310, while Mo15Re1 alloy possesses the smallest value of 0.286. Accordingly, Mo53Re1 alloy possesses the best plasticity, followed by Mo127Re1 alloy, and Mo15Re1 alloy possesses the worst plasticity.
Besides, the calculated values of the mechanical properties of pure Mo crystal in present work are also compared with the reference work as shown in Tables 3, 4 and Fig. 13, in which the good agreement between present work and reference work indicates that the research in this paper is reliable.

4. Conclusion
We have systematically performed first-principles calculations for thermodynamic stability, electronic structure and mechanical properties of Mo-Re binary alloys. The detailed results are as follows.
For the alloying element Re at substitution position, tetrahedron, and octahedron interstitial positions, the formation energies are 0.10, 7.93, and 8.73 eV, respectively, indicating that Re prefers to occupy the substitution position in comparison with two interstitial positions in Mo. The charge density distributions display that the charges around the substitution-Re atom are increased and the charge transfers are present between Re and adjacent Mo atoms, which can be confirmed by the Bader charge analysis. The density of states (DOS) demonstrates that the d orbitals of Re and Mo atoms are hybridized, revealing that Re and its adjacent Mo atoms can form the directional bond containing covalent components.
The mechanical quantities of Mo127Re1, Mo15Re1, and Mo15Re1 alloys have been analyzed by calculating the elastic constants Cij, bulk modulus B, Young’s modulus E, shear modulus G, Poisson’s ratio v, and B/G. All these mechanical quantities of both Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys are almost identical to that of perfect Mo, while all these mechanical quantities of Mo15Re1 alloy are significantly lower or higher than that of perfect Mo. This fully indicates that Mo15Re1 alloy has significantly different mechanical characteristics from Mo127Re1 and Mo53Re1 alloys as well as perfect Mo. Among three single-crystal Mo-Re alloys, the Mo15Re1 binary alloy exhibits the strongest stiffness, the worst extraordinary ability to resist transverse deformation, and the highest hardness. Among three poly-crystal Mo-Re alloys, the Mo15Re1 binary alloy possesses the worst ductility and the worst plasticity.
Based on the research results of this paper, we believe that further combining molecular dynamics simulation calculations can provide a deeper understanding of the properties of Mo-Re alloys, such as the aggregation behavior of Re in Mo as a function of Re content, irradiation temperature, irradiation dose, etc. Therefore, a more in-depth study of the aggregation behavior of Re in Mo-Re alloys, combined with thermodynamics, electronic structure, and mechanical properties, is our next focus of work.
