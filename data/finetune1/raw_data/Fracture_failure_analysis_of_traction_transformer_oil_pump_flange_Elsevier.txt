1. Introduction
The traction drive system is the “heart” of high-speed trains, supplying power to the train [1], [2]. The traction transformer is the power source and the hub of the traction power supply system [3], [4]. The oil pump, also called the traction transformer oil pump, is used in the forced oil circulation cooling system of the traction transformer, enabling effective cooling [5], [6]. The oil pump is crucial for the high-speed and safe operation of the train. The oil pump is designed to operate alongside the train, adhering to stringent size and weight constraints, with the casing fabricated from ZL101A aluminum alloy. During assembly, a flange fracture occurred at the oil pump inlet for a specific traction transformer type, causing production interruption and delayed delivery. Investigating the causes of failure, conducting failure analysis, and proposing solutions are crucial. Analyzing the fracture resulting from the oil pump flange installation failure is essential for the safe operation of oil pumps and high-speed trains [7].
Common types of mechanical structural failures include wear, fracture, corrosion, and deformation [8], [9], [10], [11]. Mechanical structure failure analysis is typically conducted using experimental and physicochemical methods [12], [13]. With the mature application of finite element analysis (FEA), many researchers have integrated it into failure analysis, greatly enhancing efficiency [14], [15]. Ebara et al. [16] utilized microfractography to analyze the failure of cold forging dies. The study focused on cold forging die steel, establishing a relationship between pre-fatigue crack extension zone width and fracture toughness. Measuring the extension zone width allows for quantitative analysis of cold forging die failure, thus improving analysis efficiency. Alonso-Martinez et al. [17] combined finite element analysis with experiments to analyze the collapse of a wind turbine tower caused by flange failure. The structural load distribution was analyzed using finite element analysis and material performance analysis to determine the cause of the failure. He et al. [18] studied the unexpected fracture of tube-to-tube sheet joints in a circulating oil steam generator. They used visual inspection, material composition analysis, and fracture surface observation. The researchers identified caustic stress corrosion cracking as the fundamental cause of the failure and provided recommendations for material selection, manufacturing processes, and maintenance practices.Hu et al. [19] analyzed the ultimate bearing capacity and optimized the structure of packer slips using load calculation, finite element analysis, and experimental validation. After optimization, the equivalent stress of the slip was reduced by 8.66 %. This optimization significantly improved the service life and reliability. Long et al. [20] investigated the causes of leakage failure in martensitic stainless steel flanges using physicochemical and finite element analyses. The results indicated that flange failure and leakage were caused by groove cracking. The formation of detrimental phases in the material significantly contributed to the failure. Excessive δ-ferrite reduced the material's resistance to pitting corrosion. Lu et al. [21] analyzed the fracture failure of aircraft wheel hubs. Using finite element and fatigue life analyses, they identified the failure mechanisms as overload and structural design flaws.
This study investigates the failure of oil pump installation. Initial analysis of the failure mechanism is based on on-site inspection. Macroscopic and microscopic inspections, chemical composition analysis, metallographic analysis, mechanical property analysis, and finite element analysis were conducted to determine the cause of failure. Suggestions for improvement and prevention are proposed. This provides guidance on eliminating and preventing such incidents during manufacturing.
2. Background of the failure
The operating pressure of the oil pump is typically around 1.0 bar to 2.5 bar, and the operating temperature ranges from −40 °C to 140 °C. The operating principle of the oil pump is as follows: The electric motor transfers mechanical energy to the pump liquid via the pump shaft. The pump shaft rotates the fixed impeller. The liquid in the impeller gains energy from the blades, flows into the pressure chamber, and then exits through the pump outlet into the oil outlet pipe. Simultaneously, the liquid in the suction pipe forms a pressure differential, flows into the pump, and enters the rotating impeller, creating a continuous flow to circulate the liquid. The oil pump is connected in series through flanges in the cooling system pipeline, as depicted in Fig. 1. Butterfly valves are installed on both the inlet and outlet sides of the oil pump for easy maintenance and replacement. The oil pump flange thickness is 15 mm, the mounting surface of the butterfly valve features a 3 mm protrusion height and includes a sealing groove for the seal ring installation. The butterfly valve is equipped with 4 × φ19 mounting holes, while the inlet flange of the oil pump has 8 × φ19 mounting holes evenly spaced. The butterfly valve is secured to the oil pump with M16 × 75 bolts.

Fig. 1. Oil Pump Installation Schematic Diagram.

According to installation specifications, the oil pump is secured to the butterfly valve using four diagonally placed bolts. Bolts are first tightened diagonally to 80 N·m of preload force, followed by a final torque of 130 N·m. During on-site operations, no issues were observed when applying the 80 N·m preload torque and the final 130 N·m torque. The first bolt and nut pair tightened without issue, but a noise occurred when tightening the second pair; visual inspection found no abnormalities. No abnormalities were found after tightening the third pair. However, a noise occurred, leading to flange fracture when torque was applied to the fourth pair, as shown in Fig. 2(a). After dismantling the faulty oil pump, flange fractures were found at bolts 2# and 4#, as shown in Fig. 2(b)(c), resulting in fractures labeled 1# and 2# (referred to as the failure part).

3. The physical and chemical analysis
3.1. Macroscopic analysis
The oil pump flange failed at two locations. Fractures occurred in the right-angle transition area directly below the installation bolts, resulting in 1# fracture and 2# fracture, as shown in Fig. 3(a)(b). The macroscopic appearance of both fractures is similar, showing distinct extension lines (Red arrows). The convergence direction of these lines indicates that the origins of both fractures are at the right-angle transition under the installation bolts, forming linear sources. The cracks propagate through the flange thickness, extending to both sides of the fixing holes and then to the flange edge. Fig. 3(c)(d) show visible installation damage marks at all bolt mounting holes of the faulty oil pump flange.

3.2. Micro-morphological analysis
Fractures 1# and 2# of the faulty oil pump flange were cleaned using ultrasonic cleaning. After cleaning, they were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for microscopic observation, as shown in the figure. Fig. 4 shows that the microscopic morphology of fractures 1# and 2# is similar. Fig. 4(a)(b) show that the fracture origins are at the right-angle transition beneath the installation bolts, presenting line sources with delicate surfaces and minimal height differences. Fig. 4 (c)(d) show no metallurgical defects in the fracture origin zones. Fig. 4 (e)(f) show the morphology of the extended areas of fractures 1# and 2#. Upon magnification, elongated brittle phases and ductile dimple characteristics are observed (Fig. 4(g)(h)). Fig. 4(i)(j) illustrate local areas of fractures 1# and 2#, revealing porosity and void defects. This confirms that the nature of the fracture is due to overload.

3.3. Metallographic structure analysis
Metallographic samples were taken from the faulty flange. After grinding, polishing, and etching, low and high magnification observations were made using a metallographic microscope, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows that the sample surface has no evident defects such as pinholes, looseness, or cracks. Fig. 5(b) shows that the fracture surface exhibits a predominantly right-angle fracture origin. Fig. 5(c)(d) show that the material structure comprises α-Al＋Si＋Mg2Si, with elongated Si phases.

3.4. Chemical composition analysis
To verify if the chemical composition of the material meets standards, a spectrometer was used to analyze the flange material. According to product manufacturing requirements, the oil pump housing material is ZL101A aluminum alloy with T6 heat treatment. The composition and content of the elements were assessed according to the GB/T 1173–2013 [22], as shown in Table 1. For comparison, parts from different batches of the same type were selected for comparison (referred to as comparison part). Table 1 shows that the Si, Ti, and Zn contents in the failure part do not meet the standard requirements. Specifically, the Si content is 8.08 %, exceeding the standard upper limit (6.5 %∼7.5 %); the Ti content is 0.07 %, below the standard lower limit (0.08 %∼0.20 %); and the Zn content is 0.18 %, above the standard upper limit (≤0.1 %). The contents of other elements comply with the standards. The elemental composition of the comparison part complies with the standards.
Table 1. Chemical composition test results of ZL101A aluminum alloy (wt.%).

Element	Major elements	Impurity elements
Si	Mg	Ti	Al	Fe	Cu	Zn	Mn	Sn	Pb
Standard	6.5 ∼ 7.5	0.25 ∼ 0.45	0.08 ∼ 0.2	Balance	≤0.2	≤0.1	≤0.1	≤0.1	≤0.05	≤0.03
Failure part	8.08	0.37	0.07	Balance	0.14	0.09	0.18	0.09	0.05	0.03
Comparison part	7.20	0.33	0.10	Balance	0.16	0.01	0.01	0.03	0.05	0.03
In the ZL101A aluminum alloy, Si is the primary element. It enhances fluidity and casting density, and within certain limits, increases strength but decreases ductility [23], [24], [25]. Ti refines grain size, strengthens alloy structure, and improves corrosion resistance [26], [27]. Zn is considered an impurity in ZL101A aluminum alloy; increased content may result from remelting scrap materials. Non-conforming elemental composition in the failure part could impact mechanical performance, leading to fractures during installation.
3.5. Mechanical property and hardness analysis
Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the materials were examined. Tensile tests were conducted on specimens cut from the flanges of both the failure and comparison part. Tensile tests were performed according to the GB/T 228.1–2021 [28] at room temperature (25 °C), and the results are shown in Table 2. According to GB/T 9438–2013 [29], specimens were cut from the main body casting to test mechanical properties. The average tensile strength and elongation after fracture should be at least 75 % and 50 % of the values specified in GB/T 1173–2013. Thus, the average tensile strength of the material should be ≥ 221 MPa, and the average elongation after fracture should be ≥ 1.5 %. Table 2 shows that the tensile strength, yield strength, and cross-sectional shrinkage of the failure part are similar to those of the comparison part. Additionally, the results reveal that the average elongation of the failure part is 1.8 %, at the lower technical limit (≥1.5 %), while the comparison part shows an average elongation of 2.8 %, indicating lower elongation in the failure part compared to the comparison part.
Table 2. Mechanical properties test results.

Empty Cell	Tensile strength (σb) / MPa	Yield strength (σ0.2) / MPa	Percentage elongation after fracture (A) / %
Failure part	Specimen 1#	285	253	1.5
Specimen 2#	284	250	2.1
Specimen 3#	284	253	1.8
Average	285	252	1.8
Comparison part	Specimen 1#	284	249	2.3
Specimen 2#	280	241	3.3
Specimen 3#	283	245	2.9
Average	282	245	2.8
Specimens were taken from the flanges of both the failure and comparison part, polished, and tested for Brinell hardness. Four areas were uniformly selected on the flange surface for measurement. Each area was measured three times, and the average values are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) shows the hardness test bar chart for the failure part, while Fig. 6(b) shows the results for the comparison part. The hardness values for both the failure and comparison part are uniform, with averages of HBW107.8 and HBW101.7, respectively. These values meet the standard requirements (≥HBW80). However, the hardness of the failure part is higher than that of the comparison part.

4. Finite element analysis
4.1. Finite element model and boundary conditions
Separate models of the oil pump flange and the butterfly valve were developed. The models were simplified by omitting internal details and unrelated parts. Fig. 7(a) shows an exploded view of the butterfly valve and oil pump flange installation. After installing the sealing ring in the butterfly valve groove, it is secured to the oil pump flange with bolts, as shown in the assembly section. Fig. 7(b) shows a close-up of the bolt installation, revealing a 3 mm gap where the mounting hole on the butterfly valve flange does not align with the oil pump flange. The material properties of the Q345D steel butterfly valve and oil pump flange are detailed in Table 3.

Q345D	7.85	0.28	210	345
Import the model into the finite element analysis software and assign material properties based on Table 3. Mesh is partitioned with mesh type predominance and element size as constraint conditions. Mesh independence verification shows that the influence of mesh size on stress is insignificant when the mesh size is less than 3 mm [30], [31]. Considering sensitivity to different mesh sizes and time cost of finite element analysis, a mesh size of 3 mm is chosen. Hexahedral meshes demonstrate significant advantages in computational accuracy, deformation characteristics, and resistance to distortion [32], [33]. Opting for hexahedral mesh predominance, global automatic control of elements, and choosing quadrilateral / triangular free surface meshes for meshing butterfly valve and oil pump flange. After mesh partitioning, the butterfly valve has a total of 37,461 nodes and 50,646 elements. The oil pump casing has 314,623 nodes and 95,889 elements, as shown in Fig. 8.

The constraints for finite element preprocessing are shown in Fig. 9. Fixed constraints are applied to the rear end of the butterfly valve, assuming it is fixed to the pipeline end. The blue circular area on the butterfly valve end indicates the contact area with the oil pump flange, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The oil pump flange and the butterfly valve end face are configured for face-to-face contact. The contact area is highlighted in blue in Fig. 9(b), and the contact surface has a roughness of 0.2. Fixed constraints are applied to the inner flange surface of the oil pump casing, assuming one end of the pump is fixed, as shown in Fig. 9(c).

The bolt pre-tightening force is applied at the fastener installation position, the relationship between pre-tightening force and torque determined by Eq.(1) [34]:
(1)
Where: T is the torque in N·m, K is the tightening coefficient (0.18), F is the pre-tightening force in N, and d is the nominal thread diameter in mm. The tightening procedure specifies applying a torque of 130 N·m to the bolt, resulting in a calculated pre-tightening force of 45139 N. During simulation, the torques due to thread friction and bolt/nut support surface friction are neglected, assuming all applied torque is converted into bolt clamping force. The load settings for finite element preprocessing are shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10(a), the pre-tightening force is applied to the area covered by the flat washer at the butterfly valve bolt mounting hole, with the force direction towards the oil pump flange. In Fig. 10(b), the pre-tightening force is applied to the flat washer-covered area of the oil pump flange mounting holes, with the force direction towards the butterfly valve.

The allowable stress of the oil pump flange is calculated from the yield limit and safety factor by Eq.(2) [35]:
(2)
Where, [σ] is the allowable stress, σs is the yield limit, ns is the safety factor, usually takes the value of 1.2 ∼ 2.5. Oil pumps used in high-speed trains retain an additional 25 % safety margin on the basis of allowable stress, which, the safety factor ns = 1.7. The allowable stress of ZL101A material is calculated to be [σ] = 147 MPa. Thus, if the stress on the material exceeds 147 MPa, it does not meet strength requirements, leading to safety risk.
4.2. Mechanical analysis
The stress and deformation analysis results of the oil pump flange are shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11(a) shows the deformation nephogram of the oil pump flange, indicating deformation primarily towards the butterfly valve. The maximum deformation occurs at the outermost edge of the mounting holes, measuring 0.269 mm. Fig. 11(b) is the stress nephogram, where the maximum principal stress can be better used to determine the fracture form than the Mises stress, showing that stresses around the mounting holes primarily concentrate on the neck area at the back of the flange. Stress values range from 210 MPa to 220 MPa. The maximum tensile stress is 241.5 MPa, which has exceeded the allowable stress. Fig. 11 (c) shows the displacement nephogram of the mounting holes, and the maximum deformation of the mounting holes is 0.297 mm along the bolt mounting direction.Fig. 11 (d) shows the mounting hole stress nephogram, the stress in the mounting hole is concentrated on the hole wall near the outside of the flange. The maximum stress reaches 220.03 MPa. Under these conditions, the structural safety margin is relatively low. Therefore, the flange structure is deemed unreliable.

4.3. Optimization of oil pump flange structure
Macroscopic analysis in Section 3.1 reveals that the fracture initiation site appears in the right-angle transition zone at the back of the flange. This zone results from lathe machining on the flange's back and its transition with the connecting pipe. Finite element analysis in Section 4.2 confirms that the right-angle transition in stressed structures causes stress concentration, resulting in excessively high local stresses and safety risks. Thus, optimizing the structure begins with adjusting the flange thickness and transition zone. Increasing flange thickness without altering installation dimensions is the optimal solution for mitigating this risk. Fig. 12 illustrates the optimized structure. Fig. 12(a) shows a schematic of the local installation, confirming that the optimized structure meets bolts and nuts installation requirements without interference. Fig. 12(b) presents the pump flange model derived from optimization results. Use this model to conduct further simulation analysis. Fig. 12(c) is the displacement nephogram of the pump flange, indicating maximum deformation of the optimized structure is 0.178 mm, a 33 % decrease post-optimization. Fig. 12(d) depicts the stress nephogram, showing reduced stress on the pump flange under optimization, with a maximum of 134.68 MPa, below allowable limits. Fig. 12 (e) shows the displacement nephogram of the bolt mounting holes after optimization, where the maximum displacement is 0.147 mm. Fig. 12 (f) shows the stress nephogram of the hole walls after optimization, with a stress distribution similar to the pre-optimization state, and a maximum stress of 129.86 MPa, below the allowable stress.The maximum stress in the optimized pump flange structure is 143.82 MPa, this structure is safe and reliable under assembly conditions.

5. Fracture cause analysis and discussion
5.1. Fracture cause
Chemical composition, mechanical property, hardness testing, and finite element analysis reveal that the Si, Ti, and Zn contents in the failed component do not meet standards, indicating non-conformity in elemental composition that may affect mechanical properties. The tensile strength, yield strength, and cross-sectional shrinkage of the failed component meet requirements, but the elongation at break is at the lower limit, indicating higher brittleness. Finite element analysis shows that when fasteners are tightened to 130 N·m, stress at the fracture source ranges from 210 MPa to 220 MPa. The yield strength is similar to the failed component's (252 MPa), indicating a small safety margin in the oil pump flange structure. Assembly abnormalities, such as abnormal tightening torque or excessively fast tightening, could increase loads and lead to component failure.
5.2. Fracture property
Macroscopic, microscopic, and metallographic analysis of the oil pump flange fracture shows that the fracture occurred at the right-angled transition below the mounting bolt, with cracks propagating along the flange thickness, indicating bolt installation failure. The fracture surface is fine-grained with minimal height differences, exhibiting abundant dendrites and porous characteristics. The failure origin is uniformly located at the right-angled transition below the mounting bolt, appearing as a linear source. No metallurgical defects are observed in the source area. The extension area exhibits elongated brittle phases and ductile dimples, indicating that the failure is due to overload fracture.
6. Conclusion and recommendation
Through the analysis of the failure parts, the following conclusions can be drawn:
(1)
The microstructure of the failed flange shows elongated Si phases. Chemical analysis indicates non-compliance with Si, Ti, and Zn standards. Mechanical properties show elongation at the lower limit of standards. Hardness is HBW107.8, meeting requirements.
(2)
Finite element analysis shows a limited safety margin in the flange structure, affecting performance and assembly conditions.
(3)
The fracture of the failed flange is due to high material brittleness and possible assembly issues.
(4)
The fracture nature of the failed flange is classified as overload fracture.
To prevent similar incidents, the following recommendations are suggested:
(1).
Rigorously control the chemical composition of casting raw materials. Consider the method of increasing trace elements to improve the problem of excessive material brittleness.
(2).
During casting, pour mechanical performance samples with the furnace and test material properties.
(3).
Perform X-ray inspections on batch samples, specifically checking for casting defects like porosity, looseness, and cold shuts at critical stress points.
(4).
Use finite element analysis for structural strength verification and optimization during product design.
